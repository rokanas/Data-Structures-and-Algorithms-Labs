 

Have you done much work?
I've done some work.
I've tried 
Good.
to sort of 
Good.
what the hell I was supposed to do with .
What were you doing ?
There's some I'm totally totally confused on .
You were doing differentiating 
 
and then
Yeah.
leaving it and then going back to it to see if you could integrate it plus some graphs .
Some of it.
Yeah.
No no I don't know what I've done with the graph.
I've been concentrating on trying to
Okay.
I've gone through these I don't know how many times.
Right.
I done them  and then I've took them down and I've gone back.
I've g I've got about a half a dozen sheets of paper scattered all over the place, and I've decided to do it in this cos then I can just go to  here.
Right.
So I've done that.
Now I can understand that, understand that.
Right.
That goes to that, two X, but I'm not sure why.
Now is that that cosh squared X ?
Yeah.
Right.
And that is  goes to two X.
 shine squared X.
You mean do you mean  ?
No.
It's two X in the book.
Yeah.
Okay.
Now he does make mistakes so that's not a 
Erm  
problem.
Mm.
And then there's That I can understand.
But that is actually is not like that.
That's X squared but when it's differentiated cos you've gotta go back into the bracket it comes out as that.
Right.
And that then goes in  
Okay.
that.
So I understand that bit.
What you're doing I mean you're coming along very well really.
But  
Aren't you?
I'm not doing too bad.
I think you're doing very well 
But its like that.
I don't get Y to twelve.
I mean I know th I know that you carry the sine on because 
Mm.
it goes to sine squared, so you you only differentiate one and according to 
Okay.
that goes to sine squared.
Right  where your twelve comes from.
Well it it must be three times four is equal 
Right.
to twelve.
Okay.
But it doesn't always go to the front of them.
Like here.
Yeah.
Well 
The use of the the two X.
So I'm not conversant with all the rules.
Mm.
Okay.
Erm  how did you differentiate these?
I mean are you learning these as they are or  I mean 
No.
do them?
How are you doing it?
No I've I've just All I've done is because  Erm  because that is a function of that
Right.
I've differentiated that.
Well I didn't differentiate it but I but I did because I couldn't decide .
As I as I was talking about for a new pattern  
.
how much you want to write it in there, it's up to you.
Just show me how you did that one.
Well, all I 
That one 
did was that I didn't know whether to do three sine squared  right ?
Mm.
Then differentiate the four X because 
 
that's your X  value.
So that'd be three times the four sine squared.
Then to differentiate the whole lot because it goes to cos.
Mm.
And that is is is not what I get cos what I was doing is doing them meself and then 
Well what Yeah.
What 
going and checking the answer.
Erm
And then if me answer was wrong trying to 
Mm.
work out  .
Can you describe  your methods.
How you how you'd do that.
Sort of writing down as many steps as you can.
Ah.
That's why i couldn't I thought I hadn't got me pen.
Erm well all 
Draw a nice picture instead.
All I did is I look at what I've got and if it's just a single term like that 
Right.
then you 
Yeah.
know to just differentiate it.
When it's two terms  like the the log erm and what  like that
Mm.
each of the two X multiplied by sine.
Okay.
That brings on another rule.
Like that 
Okay 
brings another rule.
Erm  differentiate this for me then.
Er  three X squared  plus two.
And put some brackets round that and raise that to the power five.
Okay Y 
 
equals that.
Sh show 
.
me all the steps.
Divide by D X  two.
That goes at the front, right?
Mm.
To begin with.
Right.
Now you get erm  three X squared plus two and then you differentiate What's in there, which'll give you  six.
So if you multiply it by six and it's still raised to the power .
If you differentiate three X squared what do you get?
Six.
Differentiate 
Six X.
Right.
Now.
.
Okay.
Right.
That's, that's the method.
Now why're you doing this?
What's the theory behind it?
Dunno.
Right.
Now what you're doing, or what you're, you're attempting to do  erm if I say Y equals P  
Hmm.
Find D Y by the X.
And you can't cos you haven't 
 
got a you haven't got an X in sight.
Mm.
Now what you've got here is Y equals U to the power five.
Yeah.
Right?
Now there isn't an X in sight.
Mm.
I've only got three X squared plus two there but you can't differentiate whit respect to three X squared plus two and then say you actually done it with respect to X .
 
So  erm you've seen the cha chain rule function and a function.
Mm.
This is, this is what you should be doing with it really.
Erm we've got that.
Y equals that.
Yeah.
Right.
Let U  three X squared plus two.
Okay.
 
Now we've got  Y equals U to the power five.
So we c can't find D Y by D X
Mhm.
But we can find D Y by D U.
Right?
Which is no problem.
Mhm.
Five by D to the four.
Yes?
Mhm.
Well that's found D Y by D U but what we're looking for is D Y by D X.
And D Y by D X  is what?
In terms of U and everything else.
Remember what that bit?
How to work that out?
Erm isn't it the  U .
