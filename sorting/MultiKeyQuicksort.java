    // Sort the given range of the list in-place using *multi-key quicksort*.
    // Multi-key quicksort is a version of quicksort well-adapted to sorting strings.
    // Instead of a partition into two parts, we do a partition into *three* parts:
    // * smaller than the pivot,
    // * equal to the pivot (including the chosen pivot),
    // * larger than the pivot.
    // Afterwards, we continue sorting the smaller and larger parts with the same position.

    // In addition, we are not comparing all the elements fully, but only up to / at some position.
    // For example, when comparing two strings, this would mean that we only compare the characters at index 3.
    // This is much quicker than comparing the entire strings.
    // It also makes the "equal" partition larger (it may contain strings that differ from the pivot at some later position).
    
    // In the recursion, we make sure to continue sorting with the same position in the smaller and larger parts of the partition.
    // However, for the "equal" part of the partition, we continue with position increased by one.
    // That way, we eventually compare all the characters of two strings until we discover a difference.

    // Notes:
    // * The class attribute `comparator` is now a LexicographicComparator.
    //   You should only call its method `comparator.compare(x, y, position)`.
    //   This compares x and y at the specified position.
    //   See LexicographicComparator and CharSequenceComparator for examples of what "position" can mean.
    // * You can use `swap(list, i, j)` to swap indices i and j.
    // * The last element of a list range given by `from` and `to` is `list.get(to - 1)`.
