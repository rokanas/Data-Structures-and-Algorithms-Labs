**Question**
For each of the below invocations, list:
- the number of loop iterations,
- the minimal cost,
- and a shortest path (i.e. a path having minimal cost).

After completing each task, you can fill in more data here.

Task 2: Word ladder
-------------------

**Question**
What's the asymptotic average-case complexity of WordLadder.outgoingEdges in the alphabet size K and the length N of the given word?

Average case: O(K * N^2)
(N-squared due to the substring operation(s))

Tasks 3 and 4: The A* algorithm, Guessing the cost
--------------------------------------------------

**Question**
For each of the three classes GridGraph, WordLadder, and NPuzzle, what is the approximate improvement factor in the number of loop iterations by running A* instead of UCS?
Try a number of different examples per class.

- GridGraph:
GridGraph/AR0012SR.map 11:73 90:105:
- UCS: 28689
- A*:  6068

GridGraph/AR0011SR.map 17:68 183:127
- UCS: 121235
- A*:  27034

- WordLadder: TODO
- NPuzzle:    TODO

**Question**
For which of the three classes GridGraph, WordLadder, and NPuzzle, did the heuristic guessCost have the most impact?
What do you think is the reason for this?

TODO

**Question**
What are the main differences between your implementations of searchAstar and searchUCS?

While searchUCS only makes use of the costToHere attribute of the PQEntries when deciding the priority of the
PriorityQueue; searchAstar also uses the costEstimate attribute - making it the comparing attribute instead. Meaning we
take into consideration not just the cost to get to a certain node, but in addition an estimation of the remaining
distance to the goal from that node.

Appendix: general information
=============================

**Question**
Do you know of any bugs or limitations?

TODO

**Question**
Did you collaborate with any other students on this lab?
If so, write with whom and in what way you collaborated.
Also list any resources (including the web) you have used in creating your design.

No, and none.

**Question**
Did you encounter any serious problems?

No! :)

**Question**
What is your feedback on this assignment?

Less challenging than the prior labs (not a complaint) but still fun! Was very satisfying to see the number of
iterations go down and overall optimise our program.
