Task 1: Analyzing the slow program
----------------------------------

**Question**
What is the asymptotic complexity of findSimilarity?
Answer in terms of N, the total number of 5-grams in the input files.
Assume that the number of duplicate occurrences of 5-grams is a small constant - that is, there is not much plagiarised text.
Explain briefly.

findSimilarity consists of four levels of nested for-loops:
        - 2 for iterating through documents (D^2)
        - 2 for iterating through ngrams (K^2)
Therefore, the complexity of the algorithm is D^2 * K^2, or N^2 (expressed in terms of N because N = D * K).
Since the number of duplicate occurrences of 5-grams is a small constant, we do not need to account for populating the similarity BST when considering the scalability of the algorithm.


**Question**
How long did the program take on the 'small' and 'medium' directories?
Is the ratio between the times what you would expect,
given the asymptotic complexity? Explain very briefly why.

- On the small directory, the program took 2.77s.
- On the medium directory, the program took 408.21s.
We need to compare the ratio of running times between the small and medium directories to the ratio between the expected running times for 20,000 and 200,000 elements
assuming a complexity of N^2.
- The ratio between the actual times is 408.21 / 2.77 = growth factor of 147.3
- The ratio between expected times is (200,000^2) / (20,000^2) = growth factor of 100
The algorithm's running time, does, therefore, seem to increase quadratically. It runs slower than expected, but this is likely because in our predicted asymptotic complexity,
we assume that the amount of plagiarized text is constant between directories.

OR: Assuming nlogn scaling
Log57million = 25.764458583489 so that times 57 million = 1468574139.26 operations
Log570million = 29.086386678376 so that times 570 million = 16579240406.7 operations

Time for 570M characters = (time for 57M characters) * (number of operations for 570M characters) / (number of operations for 57M characters)

→ 54.1s * 16579240406.7 / 1468574139.26 = 10.1792263 minutes or 610,753578 seconds

**Question**
How long do you predict the program would take to run on
the 'huge' directory? Show your calculations.

Using the below formula:
Time for size 4,000,000 = (time for size 200,000) * (number of operations for size 4,000,000) / (number of operations for size 200,000)

Based on our actual results:
T = 408.21s * (4,000,000^2) / (200,000^2)
T = 1,632,840,000 seconds OR 27,214,000 minutes OR 453,011.11 hours.

Task 2: Using an index
----------------------

**Question**
Which of the three BSTs in the program usually become unbalanced?
Say very briefly:
- how you observed this,
- why you think this is the case.

TODO

**Question** (optional)
Is there a simple way to stop these trees becoming unbalanced?

TODO (optional)

Task 3: Using scapegoat trees instead of BSTs
---------------------------------------------

For the below questions, we denote by N the total number of 5-grams.
We assume there is a (small) constant number of duplicate occurrences of 5-grams.

**Question**
What is the asymptotic complexity of buildIndex?
Justify briefly.

TODO

**Question**
What is the asymptotic complexity of findSimilarity?
Justify briefly.

TODO

**Question** (optional)
Instead of the previous assumption, we now allow an arbitrary total similarity score S.
Express the asymptotic complexity of the two functions in terms of both N and S (at the same time).

TODO (optional)
