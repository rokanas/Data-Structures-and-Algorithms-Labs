 

Have you done much work?
I've done some work.
I've tried 
Good.
to sort of 
Good.
what the hell I was supposed to do with .
What were you doing ?
There's some I'm totally totally confused on .
You were doing differentiating 
 
and then
Yeah.
leaving it and then going back to it to see if you could integrate it plus some graphs .
Some of it.
Yeah.
No no I don't know what I've done with the graph.
I've been concentrating on trying to
Okay.
I've gone through these I don't know how many times.
Right.
I done them  and then I've took them down and I've gone back.
I've g I've got about a half a dozen sheets of paper scattered all over the place, and I've decided to do it in this cos then I can just go to  here.
Right.
So I've done that.
Now I can understand that, understand that.
Right.
That goes to that, two X, but I'm not sure why.
Now is that that cosh squared X ?
Yeah.
Right.
And that is  goes to two X.
 shine squared X.
You mean do you mean  ?
No.
It's two X in the book.
Yeah.
Okay.
Now he does make mistakes so that's not a 
Erm  
problem.
Mm.
And then there's That I can understand.
But that is actually is not like that.
That's X squared but when it's differentiated cos you've gotta go back into the bracket it comes out as that.
Right.
And that then goes in  
Okay.
that.
So I understand that bit.
What you're doing I mean you're coming along very well really.
But  
Aren't you?
I'm not doing too bad.
I think you're doing very well 
But its like that.
I don't get Y to twelve.
I mean I know th I know that you carry the sine on because 
Mm.
it goes to sine squared, so you you only differentiate one and according to 
Okay.
that goes to sine squared.
Right  where your twelve comes from.
Well it it must be three times four is equal 
Right.
to twelve.
Okay.
But it doesn't always go to the front of them.
Like here.
Yeah.
Well 
The use of the the two X.
So I'm not conversant with all the rules.
Mm.
Okay.
Erm  how did you differentiate these?
I mean are you learning these as they are or  I mean 
No.
do them?
How are you doing it?
No I've I've just All I've done is because  Erm  because that is a function of that
Right.
I've differentiated that.
Well I didn't differentiate it but I but I did because I couldn't decide .
As I as I was talking about for a new pattern  
.
how much you want to write it in there, it's up to you.
Just show me how you did that one.
Well, all I 
That one 
did was that I didn't know whether to do three sine squared  right ?
Mm.
Then differentiate the four X because 
 
that's your X  value.
So that'd be three times the four sine squared.
Then to differentiate the whole lot because it goes to cos.
Mm.
And that is is is not what I get cos what I was doing is doing them meself and then 
Well what Yeah.
What 
going and checking the answer.
Erm
And then if me answer was wrong trying to 
Mm.
work out  .
Can you describe  your methods.
How you how you'd do that.
Sort of writing down as many steps as you can.
Ah.
That's why i couldn't I thought I hadn't got me pen.
Erm well all 
Draw a nice picture instead.
All I did is I look at what I've got and if it's just a single term like that 
Right.
then you 
Yeah.
know to just differentiate it.
When it's two terms  like the the log erm and what  like that
Mm.
each of the two X multiplied by sine.
Okay.
That brings on another rule.
Like that 
Okay 
brings another rule.
Erm  differentiate this for me then.
Er  three X squared  plus two.
And put some brackets round that and raise that to the power five.
Okay Y 
 
equals that.
Sh show 
.
me all the steps.
Divide by D X  two.
That goes at the front, right?
Mm.
To begin with.
Right.
Now you get erm  three X squared plus two and then you differentiate What's in there, which'll give you  six.
So if you multiply it by six and it's still raised to the power .
If you differentiate three X squared what do you get?
Six.
Differentiate 
Six X.
Right.
Now.
.
Okay.
Right.
That's, that's the method.
Now why're you doing this?
What's the theory behind it?
Dunno.
Right.
Now what you're doing, or what you're, you're attempting to do  erm if I say Y equals P  
Hmm.
Find D Y by the X.
And you can't cos you haven't 
 
got a you haven't got an X in sight.
Mm.
Now what you've got here is Y equals U to the power five.
Yeah.
Right?
Now there isn't an X in sight.
Mm.
I've only got three X squared plus two there but you can't differentiate whit respect to three X squared plus two and then say you actually done it with respect to X .
 
So  erm you've seen the cha chain rule function and a function.
Mm.
This is, this is what you should be doing with it really.
Erm we've got that.
Y equals that.
Yeah.
Right.
Let U  three X squared plus two.
Okay.
 
Now we've got  Y equals U to the power five.
So we c can't find D Y by D X
Mhm.
But we can find D Y by D U.
Right?
Which is no problem.
Mhm.
Five by D to the four.
Yes?
Mhm.
Well that's found D Y by D U but what we're looking for is D Y by D X.
And D Y by D X  is what?
In terms of U and everything else.
Remember what that bit?
How to work that out?
Erm isn't it the  U .
Okay.
The easy way to remember it
Mm.
is write it like that.
D Y by D X equals D Y  D Y over something times something over D X with D U in there  cancel out.
It isn't quite as simple as that but it works.
Mm.
Okay.
So D Y by D X gives D Y by D U times D U by D X.
Well if U is equal to that
Mhm.
we can differentiate that with respect to X.
We can find D U  differentiating this side with respect to X you get D U by D X and 
Mm.
on that side  then you'll get six X.
Mm.
Okay.
So we want to find D Y by D X and it's D Y by D U then it's D U by D X.
Well we've found D U by D X and we've found D Y by D U. 
So D Y by D U is equal to  D Y by D X is equal to D Y by D U, which we've found from here, from Y equals 
Yeah.
U right?four, times D U by D X which we found up here
right?
Now we haven't got X in it  yet so we can't give them the answer in that form cos they 
 
didn't tell us anything about U.
You invented that so where do you put you place U   five times whatever U 
 
was  three X squared plus two  all to the power four
times six X because normally bring that to the front.
Three X.
Right.
is one.
And you get thirty X. .
Mm.
Okay?
Now, that's, that's what you should be doing each time with these With that in and and that much in sort of 
 
as a minimum.
You wil you've obviously sort of seen the method somewhere and you're trying to do it in your head, but cos you're not going through it in a fairly formal way
Mm.
you're  most of the time you're getting it right cos this is just making the right sort of guess and you're seeing the sort of When it gets to the awkward ones y you're just sort of Well maybe it's that, maybe its something else.
Does that 
Yeah.
help?
It does help, I mean that that I have seen before but I didn't sort of understand it and you've actually  
Well the thing is after a while when you've done quite a few it comes it comes fairly easy, and you can do it in your head.
Mm.
But when you get to one where you can't do it in your head you've got to go back to this bit.
Yeah.
And sometimes I mean there, we sort of let .
There might be times when we let you do the whole lot or when you have to have more than one go at it.
Mm.
Erm  I mean if you've got something like, for example, erm say we've got the one we've just had.
Y equals something to the power .
To the power five right ?
Mm.
But it wasn't three X squared plus two .
Mm.
It was erm sine sine squared six X   plus cos three X
Mm.
Right.
Now doing that in your head would be a bit awkward.
Mm.
But there you'd do it in three goes I mean, you could probably do it in two goes, but to be safe you could  split it up into three goes so 
What rule does that bring out because that .
Well 
Is that still the same, you just
There's an there's an add in there.
Mm.
Right.
So lets  erm .
Yeah.
L equal seven X  okay and  M equals D X.
Right we don't we can probably do these these bits in your head quite easily.
Mm.
Okay.
So we've got here, differentiate that we get D L by D X.
D M by D X is true.
Mm.
Now what were trying to find inside .
We haven't done anything about this.
It's all to the power five yeah?
Mm.
So we could maybe do what we did last time.
Let U equal this lot in the brackets.
Sine squared seven X.
three X  Now we're trying to find D U by D X.
Mm.
At some stage.
Well you could probably do that one in your head.
Mm.
And what would that come to?
Erm that'd be fourteen cos squared seven X.
So if you differentiate sine squared what do you get?
That.
Cos squared.
Cos squared
 
Well that's what I wanted to ask you.
What happens to them?
Because I know I asked one of my friends 
Mm.
because I wasn't I said how come it ends up being that and they said you just carry.
When you're using the trig function and you're differentiating 
Mm.
it, that you do use because it goes 
 
to the front but it stays the same.
It carries on right the way through.
You don't lose the value of it.
Good.
Right.
Okay.
But the squares I wasn't sure what happens to them and I confused him by asking him.
Okay.
Let's look at this.
Erm  L is equal to seven X
Mm.
So


So it'll be about five stages in this.
working it out any of them  them all and then you can miss out the ones we do you feel you don't need.
Just look at that bit.
You're trying differentiate what's inside there with respect to something.
Well if you've got something like erm  that one.
Tan plus seven X.
So we've got Y equals  sine L What're we having? seven X.
Mm.
Squared.
Squared.
We write it like that because it's sine squared, it is more obvious what the meaning is.
Mm.
Now we can't differentiate that  with respect to L.
Mm.
Because it's not L, it's sine L.
Okay.
If that was i if that was L squared  Y equals X squared, you could differentiate that with respect to X.
If it's Y equals L squared you could differentiate it
Mm.
to L.
It's not.
It's sine.
So  we'll differentiate  gonna have another substitution on this one.
So it's all just 
 
goes on and on and on until you can get something that's erm a straight forward one letter to the power so you can differentiate it.
So  let H equal sine L.
Mhm.
now we've got Y equals H squared.
Well that's no problem.
D Y by D H  cos now  two H.
Mm.
but now we've got H equals sine L.
Does that define D H by D L?
Mm.
And if you differentiate sine sine L you get?
Five sine L erm cos L.
Erm  Well we've got cos .
Now we're trying to find from this one.
Let's work out what we're going to do.
We're trying to find D Y by D X   but we can't find that,
Mm.
so we're going for D L   D L by D X
Mm.
times D Y by D L.
Mhm.
Okay?
Why isn't that er cos ?
If you differentiate sine X what do you get?
Cos X.
We don't get cos X or
So because you took the number of  X value away.
Erm
If you substituted L.
You've taken that, you've squared X so you've got You've made that into another value.
Right?
So  
Mm.
you've made that Y equal to H squared.
So that becomes H so the value of that 
I started off
let H equal sine L.
Yeah.
Right.
Now   If if all let's say all we've got to differentiate was Y equals sine squared X.
Mm.
Now I could find D Y by D sine X.
Mm.
differentiate that, with respect to sine X but not with respect to X.
No .
Right.
And if I if I found D Y by D sine X that would show me, not the gradient of this curve,
Mm.
the gradient of the curve that I would get if I plotted Y against sine X.
Mm.
But we're plotting Y against X which'll obviously be a very different curve with 
Mm.
lots of different gradients  Thank you very much sir.
Thank you.
Right I'll leave you to it.
So for that there's there's no way of differentiating that with 
 
respect to X.
There is eventually because you learn it.
You know Oh it comes out as cos X.
Mm.
Or comes out as whatever it comes out as.
Right?
You can differentiate sine X on its own like that.
Y plus cos X, but we can't differentiate that straight off without changing and doing the substitution.
So we'll let er what letter haven't we used yet?
Q.
So if we let Q equal sine X  we can find D Q by D X   we can differentiate this side with respect to X and that side  Q by D X when we differentiate .
Mm.
Okay?
Now we've let Q equal sine X so we've got Y equals Q squared.
We'll differentiate that with respect to Q.
No problem.
Right?
differentiate both sides with respect to Q 
To Q. 
Right.
Okay?
But we're looking for here, D Y by D X so we have D Y by D X is equal to and we just write, D Y D X.
D Y by D Q
there 
D Y by D Q
Two Q.
Is two Q  times
Q by D X .
Okay?
Mhm.
Now we've found D Y by D X all we need to do is put back Q to what it was.
Mm.
Right which is sine squared X.
So s two  sine squared X 
Mhm.
Okay.
So you're sort of right in a way that it's  two sine squared X but this  wrong.
Are you are you happy with that??
Yeah.
Mhm.
Okay  get Y equals X squared no problem.
Two X.
Mm.
Y equals  log X squared you can't just  picture log X.
No.
very very different.
We're finding the gradient  the gradient on a specific graph when we plot the X against the Y, the Y against the X.
Right?
Mm.
If we say well that looks a bit awkward so we're going to plot the Y against sine X or the y against log X
Mm.
Erm or the the Y against I mean in this one if you You could plot that against X which is the normal way.
If you tried to plot that against Think of how you'd do it if you had a graph and you plotted Y against three X squared plus two.
Mm.
Well you'd just get Y equals A graph that would look exactly the same as Y equals X to the .
Yeah.
Which is why the gradient of it would be five times that expression to the power four.
Yeah.
Okay.
But that would not be the gradient of plotting Y against X.
A very different graph.
Mm.
So .
Try and think of what you do when you find D Y by D X.
It becomes oh well you you do some little tricks on numbers and you shuffle them about and that's the answer they want.
Mhm.
If you can get it back that's why I say do the graph if you can get it back to  erm  but it's not just something to the fifth, it's really It's something to the tenth.
Right  Okay one way differentiating that
Mm.
is multiply it out.
You've got five lots of brackets there.
Three X squared plus two every one.
Mm.
In the half an hour multiply them all out, right?
And you get terms in X to the tenth.
Yeah.
Everything else all the way down.
And you could just differentiate each term quite simply then.
once you've done the multiplying, the differentiation would be very simple.
there'd just these straight powers of X, and you could do that and you'd get to the same answer as we get to  it's just that this is a quicker way of doing it.
Mm.
But that, that is a Y equals something  X to the tenth, so it's it's not going to have a gradient that requires Y equals something to the tenth.
Mm.
Which is why you must  do that sort of That that's probably all you need  for that bit.
To know what you're doing right.
Erm  I think it would be useful for you do one the same way.
Erm  we'll do a fairly simple one and then use the same one but make it a little bit more complicated.
Mm.
What what rule is that?
The chain rule?
a function of a function  
Mm?
the chain rule.
You can't do it in one go, so you split it down into bits.
Because it is a function of a function of X?
Yeah.
Right.
And then they want the gradient of Y against X.
Not Y against the function, a sub-function of X .
Mm.
So if we get something like 
  

Right.
Have a go at that one.
Yeah.
So we put the  or sine squared  think it's better leaving it like that because  it's sine brackets  
Well what do you think?
Well I think


Erm   think it's probably better if .
Okay.
Go on.
Have a 
 
have a have a go, See what happens with that.
Alright.
Well I know now that that's not right.
Good.
Okay.
Well okay.
Fine.
If you know it's not right, scrub that.
Think of something more useful to let U be equal to Cos this is the the main part of it.
Working out what you're going to put U equal to.
Well if I put U equal  because  brackets  the bracket there .
Right.
.
And .
Okay.
and let that equal sine squared.
Well we've had that already, but sine squared doesn't mean anything.
No.
Does it?
I'd like you to get your calcu calculator out, look up the sine of
 
some some number but I'm not going to tell you what it is and then 
 
square it.
Mm.
But how do you separate that then?
That's it.
That's that's it until I know or I know what I'm actually looking for in it I can run around chasing me tail all day which 
Right.
is basically what I do know.
Right.
Okay.
Okay what've we got here?
Erm  if I said Y equals sine squared X,
Mm.
you couldn't differentiate that .
Mm.
You'd have to do what we did on the other page .
You'd have to do this.
Mm.
So that was sort of on this one.
What do we do there?
What do we let U equal to?
Squared  
Let Y equal Q squared.
Mm.
Yeah, so we let the whole thing there that was raised to the power be equal to something.
So  if we let V not U Right, we let U be that,
Mm.
and let V If if U is zero,
Mhm.
then V will be You can write it as sine squared but I'm just writing this way cos it it means more.
Sine V brackets raised to the power .
Three equals sine U 
 
squared.
Okay?
Right, can you take it from there do you think?
Well, I'll have a go.
Try to sort of keep in mind what you're aiming for but don't rush getting there.
See the steps along the way.
.
Is that right?
Right, can you see what you're doing?
Yeah.
This isn't a simple two stage one like the other one.
You've got to try and work out what this middle step's going to be.
Mm.
I'll give you I'll give you a clue and see if you can work out how you're going to get towards it.
What we're going to do The way we can work it is something like D Y by D X is equal to, now we've got that,
Mm.
so we can differentiate both sides there with respect to U.
Mm.
And find D V by D X.
So we can  D V by D U.
D V by D U  times  What do you want .
Then  come across D Y by And at the end, D X.
So what've we got in terms of X?
We've got D U.
Yeah.
So we can find D U by D X.
So we can find something by D U.
Mm.
What've you got in terms of U?
We've got D V in terms of U so we can find D V by D U.
So we get D Y by D Y by D V
Mm.
Right?
Times D V by D U.
Mm.
Times D U by D X.
Which is simply those and those cancelling out.
And 
Mm.
it comes to?
D Y by D U
That'll come to D Y by D X.
So that that'll go out with that  that'll go out with X 
 
an you get D Y by D X.
So you've got you've got the V in terms of U.
Yeah.
So you can find D V by D U.
Okay?
We've got U in terms of X so you can find D U by D X.
And you've got V, now.
Erm  you've got Y.
Where's Y gone?
You haven't got Y in this one.
Okay.
Then what's Y equal to?

What can I do for you today?
It's me throat at the back er  keep and I try to clear it and I can't.


worse I should think.
Is it a tickle or a pain or a
No it it just feels as though You know I can't er can't shift it.
Right.
Do you actually cough anything up when you
No.
it's this horrible feeling.
Yeah.
Right.
Does it hurt to swallow?
No it just feels as though like You know how you get summat stuck in your throat?
That's just 
Aha.
how it feels like .
Yeah.
You don't think you have got anything stuck?
I dunno.


You haven't had any bony fish?
Or bits that have gone down the wrong way?
Or As far as you're aware?
no.
You've got no problems swallowing?
No.
Okay, chin up, open really wide, really really wide.
Stick your tongue out.
Ah.
Oh that's interesting, let me have a closer 
Oh.
look.
Right, really really wide.
Stick your Keep sticking your Keep your tongue out.
Really really wide.
Yes.
Okay, let's try again.
really really wide I won't put that in now 

Hello  well my own name's Elizabeth  of Dalvaine Glen  Ayloch is that what you mean?
Mhm.
And er I've been there all my life and that's and that'll be eighty seven years old come May and er I've just worked on the farm all my days and er then of course when my people died I just er stayed myself, and then lived with other people here and there, just to help them.
And then I came down to Kerry after my operations because I was er  for my feet, I had to get them  amputated because For the hardening of the arteries
Mhm.
but  they did very, they did marvellous things for me down in in Dundee
Mm.
so that I can now walk fine  with my plastic legs .
And then I come down to Kerry all winter because it's not good for me to stay up there myself all winter  and I have got good lodgings here.
So you're three years short of your ninetieth birthday.
Yes  I'm that.
Aha 
Can you recall much about your young days, Elizabeth, up Glen  Ayloch 
Oh yes oh well just ordinary country  country days, just you worked on the farm.
You got up in the early morning and helped in the farm, milked the cows,fed my cows and calves and  looked the pigs, and then you'd hens and chickens and the pet lambs and things like that.
And then of course at er the time of the lambing time you had to go out and help with the lambing time,you know, to help the shepherds with If he'd a weakling lamb you'd always to bring it in the house and then feed it in a bottle.
Mm.
And keep it warm  and then er if you had er Then you had the chickens to  you had to set the clucking hens and  and bring out as many chickens as you could.
And then after, in the winter, and then after that when it was near hay time, I had to go out and help with the hay.
That was gathering it in and if they were putting it into little into tramp  coles I had to get up and tramp hay round and round the boss and er I did that  .
And what exactly were the tramp  coles 
Tramp  aha, it was tramp  coles they called them, they were ricks you know  and you got into  and you put up the hay and you tramped round and round you see?
And er helped all you could and then er 
You used a a boss with the ricks?
Yes there was a boss in the middle and then they put that up.
What was the boss like?
Oh it was a three poi pointed thing.
I it was er, you know, three three points like this.
Mm.
You see like that and 
Like like the tripod?
Yes just like that.
But it was er we call it the boss.
And we called them tramp  coles but a lot of them called them tramp ricks.
But it was er in er our country district it was er hay  coles tramp  coles then.
And then after the hay time it was er wearing on to harvest time.
And I had to help with the harvest too.
And when I was younger we hadn't a binder, we just had the ordinary mower.
And er you went round and his father did er what they called the sheaf.
He sat on this mower you see and and er as it cut the  sheafed it off you see and we'd to make bands,y you know with pieces of s er And then the lifters put that on the bands and bound them and through the the site.
So that was a whole days work often.
How many sheaves were in your rick?
Oh I couldn't say for that.
Now can can you just 
There'd be cart there would be two cart loads anyway to 
 
making er  the hay To make er That was in the harvest time for the harvest it would be oh nearly three three cart loads of sheaves for a for a stack.
For a stack?
Yes for a stack.
But how about the weer ricks?
Oh the the ha that was also You had that for er the harvest you had er to build the sheaves all round it, you see, too.
And how how did you make these weer ones?
The the you know th the hay ricks?
The hay ricks oh they were just er They were the same but  they were no pointed like the h hay  the  Like they have er time of the harvest time, the hay ricks was just round and round and =nd =d sloped up to a point.
And then er  a and then after they had been in hay ricks for a long time they were brought up to the farm and built into a bigger stack, a bigger thing.
How were they they brought up?
Brought up with a with a  cart.
Cart and er they put er what we called a big thing over the hays The hay Called that the hayrick over the .
And then the when they were built Sometimes some folk used to build them into what they called a  hay soo It was a square kind of a thing but er  and I don't know why they put it into a hays  hay soo as we say,but it seemed to er  it seemed to be better to keep the h the wet out I suppose.
But in our days at home we just put it into a a a great big hay stack as we said,.
Did everyone up Glen  Ayloch use the boss?
Yes everybody used the boss, everybody.
Mhm.
And in fact  the bigger farms than ours, they used to have a circle of stones.
Round, you know, to keep it up off off the ground, and to keep it aired.
And what were they called?
Er  erm  what do you call them again?
It was the the found, F O U N D, the found, you know the foundation.
But just ordinary language it was called the found.
Mm.
The found of the stack.
You never used the the word  staffel stanes 
No we  that's was from No we didn't  different  Mhm.
Was brushwood ever used?
No n Well yes a lot of it was brushwood or the or erm branches of the birch trees that was that was laid out for that Above the stones and then you put that above.
Now can you tell me in a wee bit more detail how you did that?
Well it was just their own The the found of the thing was just built of big stones round about the size of the bottom of a stack.
And then they've got er branches of the From the wood or er or sometimes people did broom and put it on.
Mhm.
So that's er all that I can say about that you see?
And then of course the hay st the hay stack was built in a different style by the harvest stack it was built different.
But the foun the foundation was the same.
Mm.
What was the difference?
The It was different because the haystack was r rounded, you see?
And built er well well you was when you was building the hay the harvest You see the sheaves was different you see?
They were all built round and round and up until they came to what they called the  the e the part of the stack where they begin to to make it up to the top, you see?
And it was er They used to great pride in their in their er stacks because they had to make them as neat as they could and er well built, so that if the So that w that was good for the To keep the the wind  keep them dry.
And er and then people took great interest in making as bonny as they could in the top, to make a fancy top  what they called erm c corn dollies.
Er you've maybe heard of that.
Now tell me about this.
Well er they did them They made them f f fancy kind of things on the top like a They would maybe  crisscrosses and things like that and m make a rounded thing like a Just like what some folk has a tassel on their bonnets, well we made that on the top of the stack.
And every farm used to Farmer lad used to see where Who could make the best looking one.
Then there was always the harvest home dance, and then the school, that was the only place we had to dance in that day and they had it decorated with various kinds of the the the c corn dollies and erm
What type of shapes of corn dollies were there?
Oh they were they were er crisscrosses and er  and r and some of them would be rounded.
But most of them were just a a crisscross kind of a thing and then some would be have a round bit and then this little corn dolly this little  n knob on the top.
That was that was  you see.
Mhm.
like that.
That wasn't the same thing as the maiden?
The maiden's the we what we called the maiden was the last sheaf, it was cut er the last sheaf in the on the er on the fields was called the maiden sheaf.
It was great thing to keep it and it was always kept and looked after until the following year.
Who who got the maiden?
Oh the whoever the whoever the farmer At least the it used the What would I say?
The  grieve on the farm.
We 
 
didn't have a  grieve it was just my brothers that was there at the time.
But the sheaf was always cut The last sheaf was cut then it was er put in the barn and kept there for the year  and 
 
that was called the maiden sheaf.
Mm.
And what was the the purpose behind the custom?
Oh it was just er just I suppose luck, just an idea to have the last sheaf it was called the maiden sheaf.
Mhm.
And every farmer up the glen would do this?
Oh yes everybody had their last sheaf.
Th Looked after it, aha.
Oh great competition it was, in my day about who could build the best stack er you know both in the hay  coles and the and the harvest time.
So  And then of course we had our own thrashing mill and we did our own thrashing but it was great fun down the glen when they got the thrashing mill in.
It was er you know they came with a big traction engine and the thrashing mill and then they they got up early in the morning and there was the man that looked after the thrashing mill and  fork from the carts onto the  onto the mill.
Then there was somebody cutting string, cutting the sheaves you see?
And then there was the man to look after the rest of the straw and another one for the what we called the  calf And  the corn, oh it was a great day the day the thrashing mill came to the glen.
What was done with the  calf 
The  calf was er the  calf was the chaff you know from that.
Aha that was just went in  It was all blown to the side and that was it was kept just for the for the  carol beasts for the sheds you see, for the  that was what the what we saw what they bedded them down with that.
Mm.
The  calf Mhm.
And and and say your mother and grandmothers day was it used for  tykes at all?
Er yes they did that.
Yes the best if there was a dry time a dry stack, they kept that very best but for the  calf beds,both for the bothy and the house.
You know there was no downs  fancy things in my day when they were I was little  you see?
Mm.
Going back to the harvest time
Mhm.
Yeah.
Away back in time or maybe what your 
Yes.
mother told you,
Yes.
did folk come from other parts to help with the  harvest?
Yes the tinkers used to come up from Blair Gowrie to to do that long ago.
I remember myself, one time we had we had  two grand fields and it were They were almost ripe when it came an awful time of rain, and they were just a sort of flattened.
So father had to get the men up from Blair Gowrie, there was six of them that came.
Er well there was  and their wives.
And they just had this the er er  You know the  what was I to say  they had their their s scythes to cut the What was I to say?
They had their their scythes to cut them with, you see?
And then the the men cut the like that and then the women s they lifted the, and the next lad he stuck them so that it was a very busy time.
It was a busier time for us because we had to feed the  the the six of them w we put them into a big shed and they just slept there but we we gave them their dinner, they managed to make their own breakfast and their tea whatever They had bread and stuff like that but we had to make their dinner for them.
So it took them days but we were very glad to have them because they were It was such a good crop and they were lying flat.
Mm.
So that was  did.
How did you get word to them at that day?
Well they they just went out and  and cut the  round about you see even though it was damp they cut it though it was wet,
I see.
they they didn't wait till it was dry.
But I meant how did you get word down to Blair Gowrie?
Oh they just  There would always be somebody would be on the road at any time looking for harvest time and my father would say to someone, tell the McGregors We called them that time, so the McGregors came up went tell told the others.
So the whole camp lot came up and er they Oh but it wasn't only our farm, they did other farms  by.
And then of course we had the mower and then we got a binder  and now I see they've  er a harvester.
Mm.
It was a great thing the other day when I saw the combine harvester coming up the glen.
But going back again to the 
Yes.
the tinkers, did they come up with their own scythes?
Yes they come up with their own scythes oh yes they all had that er and oh  could fairly sharpen too.
Mhm.
And oh it was great to see them mm.
Th they sometimes brought their own two little boys with them and they would make the the bands to cut them  bands to do the sheaves, so.
Did your grandmother I don't know if you had
Aye I've a grandmother and everything.
Aha.
time to listen much to her when you were younger?
Oh yes .
But did did she ever talk about the the thre the  thrievers 
No she never said that no.
The the men and women that used to go with their own sickles.
Yes that oh oh That was a l that was in my great grannie's time that they went there.
That was the Mhm.
No there was none of that near in our time.
But in my great grannie's time I think they did that.
Where where did they they come from?
From Blair Gowrie and district that's usually where all those working people came from.
Mhm.
Great l vans of them used to go round the glens doing that.
And did some go from the likes of Deeside or Braemar down to the the lowlands ?
No I suppose they had but er I No that I knew of.
That was beyond me.
Mhm.
That's away back  .
That was further back that was in what I would say my great grannie's time.
Mhm.
Mhm, so that's a hundred year ago and more.
Mm.
A hundred year before yourself?
Yes.
Mhm.
A hundred year before myself yes.
Now again say before the the great war, the first war 
Yes aha.
what other types of folk would be coming up Glen  Ayloch 
Oh they were just all that kind all those working kind of folks going up the glen.
A right decent lot of folk they were from Blair Gowrie.
There was the Stewarts and there was the er the  Townsleys and Higgins, you called them and Whites that was the four lot.
Ooh, hard working chaps they were too.
Honest fellows they were.
And just last Two year ago I met one of the older kind and oh she wasn't pleased where they used to do their put their camps.
She somebody has fenced it off, she says I could see them far enough, she said, we always had that bit for our camp and it was further down the glen  .
Whereabout in the glen did they camp?
They'd camp just beyond the Between the hotel and erm the the What we call the round house  Knockshannoch Do you know where it is ?
Mhm.
Well there was a bit there where they always used to camp.
But then when they went up when they passed it just two year ago it was fenced off.
And did the 
Mhm.
tinker folks er have any things to sell?
Oh yes any amount any amount of pots and pans and laces for your boots and, what we call  pirins that was cotton reels.
And  and thread and er then there was even great lots of things for your Even ordinary pins they had that,and anything you could near ask for they had it.
Tapes and yards of lace and and er sometimes some of them would have even pieces of cloth for an apron, if you know what an apron is.
For a pinny.
Mhm.
They were the better kind that managed that because they didn't have much money to buy them, so.
And then the men folk used to give them a bit of tobacco and stuff like that, mhm.
And sometimes if there was just a few of the men maybe two men in the camp, they would come and help with even fencing or or erm build up a dyke or something like that Even drain they would stay for days if they wanted draining the fields, mm it was that.
Did they do any work in the woods?
Er no no not no in my time, no.
Mm.
How about they old style pack man that used to come ?
Oh er he used to come round with that, aha.
He used to go He came up when he would go from Blair and he would come up our glen and he would maybe walk over the hill to Braemar, or over the hill to Clover I suppose.
He had a big pack on his back, I don't know where he stayed He he stayed in everybody's farmsteadings or some place like that.
There was a place he lived further down the glen and the old farmer said I've no objections to you going in there but give me your pipe.
He would never let  him smoke .
You see, he would be afraid for him setting fire to the steading I suppose.
And did the pack man have a name or?
I think the only body that I knew was er an old man McDonald, you called him, was a pack man at that time.
he was a right old chap him.
I think he was an Aberdonian really  the way he spoke anyway but he'd been brought up in Blair Gowrie.
Mhm.
So that was them.
And what was this pack like?
Oh they had it  well would just be anything it was just a long roll th great big roll, just like It just sort of wrapped in a grey eh a big waterproof kind of co covering, and he would have er shirts and and er things like that for men to buy, or er and sometimes er  overall or a pinny, as we said, for mother and the like of that.
Oh it was a great thing when the old pack man came to undo his rolls of things, mhm  so
And did he bring the news?
Oh yes  anything that happened down the glen or way  was heard that from the pack man so it was bound to be true.
Mhm.
So folk looked forward to the pack man?
Oh I couldn't say for that.
You know they looked forward to him coming round ?
Aye aha.
For a crack maybe?
No oh he would no he had always his his idea coming for to sell something.
Ah I see .
Aha.
And then that's another thing he always got something to eat which was a great help of those days, and especially if there was If mother was baking or anything like that he always got a scone or something,mhm.
And er Oh and if he If the time of the the er tinkers that they came round, if they came round about the time of the the pig killing they would look for the piece of bacon.
They hoped to get a bit of that if you know, aha.
Can you tell me about how the folks long ago used to do the the pig?
How they killed the pig?
Oh it was a great day the day the pig was killed.
You had to get up in the morning and see that there was plenty of a great pot of of hot water, boiling water.
And then er the man that went round with all these knives and things he went down to the to the  soo cray if you ken what that is.
And he got the pi and then held the pig and I never was at the actual killing but I know they did er Then they cut its throat you see?
And then they put into what we called the  the  skeel great big round thing like a What we call it?
Er I suppose a tank, now, a round one, big thing.
And then they scraped and scraped and cleaned it and then they hung it up by the legs up, pulled it up to the steading, up to the ceiling.
And then er did the rest of the scraping and then they er  opened it up and took out all the intestines and er the livers and the  lights and tongue and things like that.
And it hu go And it was there and it was left all night, and next day erm the man came back again and he cut it down the back with a big saw, and divided it up and then it was taken to the house where it was er  up and then salted in a big barrel.
And then, before that, if you if you was to make the mealy puddings the it that always had to be cut into bits and emptied and washed well in cold water, and with salt and that, and that was They would done that for three days before they were then filled up to make the mealy puddings.
But then next day after the s pig was killed up it was The the head had to be cut into sections and well cleaned and left overnight in the salt water and To clean any bloody parts on it.
And then it was boiled and boiled that it was er tender and that and then it was taken out and cut into bits and this is what a potted head And then it was That was done and then er Where the water what was boiled there was often fat but that was all skimmed off, and er next day there was as much water in the And er meat from the head was put in and pepper and salt and that, and then it was boiled again and then put into little dishes and that was your potted head.
So that er it was good food for for weeks on end.
We had a fine dairy that we er er of stone shelves and and that kept cool when everything And it was good for weeks.
So that was our potted head, and then the the bacon itself was kept in er salt water
Mm.
And er it was salted and then For a few days, and then it was put in what we called brine,s more salt, and covered and it would be there for six weeks.
And then it was taken out and er dripped and cleaned, and then it was hung up in the kitchen to dry, and that was how the hams were done.
Mm.
And  did you ever hear of saltpetre being used?
Yes sometimes, we didn't use saltpetre, but a lot of people used saltpetre in it too.
I don't know why they did it.
Whether it was give it a better flavour or no, I don't know but we never used the saltpetre  .
Where did most folk hang the the pig?
They ha the er When it was cut up like that, in the house there was er
 Cleaks 
There was  cleaks there was er  cleaks in er in Most of the kitchens had rafters, a lot of them, and there was  cleaks just specially for the hanging the pigs and the er the hams of the  And then you left them until they were fairly dry, and then you had to cover them well and truly with a  for all summer, because the fly would go for them, if the weren't properly salted and dry.
And that would have been an awful loss if you had lost a  a a a ham.
Cos if the the blue fly went there and and maggots got into it, it would just be a job.
Mhm.
Can you tell me about the the older type of houses up the glen, what they were like inside?
Oh I don't know.
They were just o ordinary little places, all the places that ever I was in,they were Yes the the kitchen and that had we'd rafters and then there was er the fireplace a just er  generally just like, were two stone and there's ribs across.
They were like that.
And er any bigger kitchen, there was nearly always er what we called a box bed in it, and er it was er That was where the mother and the father lived.
Now Elizabeth, up Glen  Ayloch what types of area where most of the houses built on?
Was on the heights or was it in the hollows?
No they was on Well just the side of the hills, the Most of the houses were that.
There was very few there was very few houses built high up.
In fact  Well there was Craighead was  it was built up high on the hill side.
And another one was Bollyeld it was high up, it was far above the road.
And what were the the parts of the glen called?
Well the place where I was lived up we were called er er the we were Upper Islay, over passed the fence, aha.
I think my granny used to speak about the Clachan at Dalvaine, when there was er about five or six houses there and the that was the That was Upper Islay.
And the next lot was  Foulder and then the next part of the glen was  Claypots And then there was the  Broulands and then there was the Curtain of Glen  Ayloch Er that was where the the market used to be held at the Curtain of Glen  Ayloch where the hotel is now.
There's very few who'll speak about the Curtain I think now cos they speak about the hotel, but we say the Curtain of Glen  Ayloch And then and then further down was Dyke Ends and that was our lower end of the glen, so that was there.
Mm.
In your granny's day were there quite a few folk?
Oh a great lot of folk, even round about m our place there was forty people.
At our wee place, er you see my grandfather had the meal mill,
Mhm.
er and er so he employed somebody there and then was the little farm at the time.
And across the way there was another farm, a little one, it was called  Auchenree Was  Auchenree and there was Dalvaine, and then there was er er Dalvaine cottage, and then there was another house called The Hillock.
And another one at the watersi at the burnside was called the Burnside Dalvaine.
Mhm.
And the people that lived there there was  were there for the season, but they would help with the harvest, so they go dyking and fencing and er r r and at the time of the shooting season they would be employed with poling man  and dog man or something like that of long ago.
And and who were these people?
Er the who came to the be the shooting tenants?
Oh we had it was the  Airleys we had at that time.
Mm.
And then they let their big house er at  Auchen to  Sir Anthony Edens was even there and erm  a lot of those kind of people were there.
And who else was there?
Er  well a lot of the people was there.
And then there was er Lambert and Gwyn and Butler  the tobacco people.
They were another set of people that had it.
Mm  but who were the the people that used to help out with the dyking and?
No the men that was work oh the men that was just there was oh Those names was the one who came for the shooting season .
Mhm.
But you know you mentioned that people used to help out with the dogs .
Oh they were helping there.
Oh there was a lot of them, there was MacGregors and Ramseys and and er McNichols and MacKintoshes and goodness knows any amount of them.
They were glen folks?
They were glen folk yes.
And Thompson he was a grand lad he could do everything near.
Mm.
He he was he could plant trees, he could er  er you know, he did that and he could see to planting and er er and looking after woods and things of that kind.
You mentioned there the Clachan of Dalvaine.
Yes that was where Islay is, aha.
That was what my granny used to speak about that place 
Mhm.
we all the little folks round about it.
And are many of these houses now in ruins?
They're all in ruins, yes.
And there's a bit a very  a very Aye, one that my father used to tell us about it.
Long ago the the abbots of Cupar Angus, they came up to spend the summer m summer months at Dalvaine.
And down by the water side it  there's a  a sort of a ruin  just you can see it and he said that was where they stayed, a little monastery there.
And the abbots used to come up and then they would  stay and have their meal in  Kilray down at what they called the  aiden or the tavern, and then they would walk over the hill of  Kilray right up until they came to Dalvaine.
And I suppose it was some of my great grandfathers or some of them, had the looking after of them.
They had to see that they were provided with milk and butter and eggs and er venison and the rabbits and things for their food.
This old this old lad he was called James Graham of long ago.
Well well.
Mhm.
So that's many hundred years ago now but it is er er it's not long ago since I read that in w in  museum in  Ayloch 
Ah.
But er But I've known that story about the er about them coming up that way and they stayed at the the burnside at Dalvaine.
And h you heard it from your father?
Yes, aha, my granny too, spoke about that this lad he'd to look after them.
So so not only did you read it you heard about it.
Mhm.
I heard about it and then I read about it mhm.
I see.
Mhm.
And you mentioned the ruin where they used to live, did that have a a name?
Where the abbots lived?
The abbot's li the abbots lived at the burnside at Dalvaine, that's what they call this little place.
In fact you could see it near yet the where it is round about Dalvaine.
It's just I I It's just opposite the house, the farm house at Dalvaine, on the right hand side there's the there's the old lime kiln, it's there.
And then there's traces of er you know you could see where the old foundations and things were.
That's so that's there the abbots used to stay.
Mhm.
Lots of long ago.
Mhm.
Did your  grandparents mention any other parts of the glen that used to used away back in time that are just ruins now?
No I don't know anything no.
The only thing is another old place that  in was  Auchentipple There used to be a chapel there and it was called the Hunt Chapel, but it's just a hunt  now.
And there used to be a a little croft croft there of long ago, and  it's er it's all planted now with trees all round about it but I suppose they could still see where they used to be A black smith had stayed there.
I don't know why they'd ever had a little place yonder but there was crofts near everywhere,
Mm.
long ago.
Mhm.
And then there Further up the glen from me, from our, house there's a place called  Dalnasnecht It's a little place in the beside the water and beyond it there's a great piece of ground on the hill and it was called er Argyll's Reed where Argy Where all Where Argyll's men stayed when they came to burn down the bonny house early, Forter Castle.
And where about was that now?
That's er you know h have you be Did you ever notice the old building at Forter?
Aha.
Well that was where the the Where Argyll and them came and they burnt it down.
And his people were er billeted roundabout, where they were  lifting everything they could I suppose to eat and kill or something.
But this piece of ground was always called er Argyll's Reed.
And that's where?
Argyll's men stayed the the 
Mhm.
the soldiers.
Whereabout is the actual?
That was opposite er further up the glen from me from 
Mm.
Dalvaine.
It's up and it's past It's it's  Presnareburn in the  Skrandert I it was to be a fort of long ago too, Fort 
Mm.
, and then across from that is er there's  Dalnasnecht 
Mhm.
And the and it's up there.
Very good.
That's ancient history anyway.
And were there many er local parts named  by the people of the glen?
Hills and rocks and all sorts of things ?
There's a place just just across the water from us and it's called  Dalinnoch That's a nice little flat bit and er And  Dalnasnecht was another one,and er 
They seem to have a Gaelic sound to some of these names .
Mhm, there's there all Gaelic, There with Gaelic was spoken in the Glen  Ayloch many years, er even though the lower end of the glen didn't.
Our folk up at Dalvaine and that, they spoke the Gaelic long after it was spoken down the glen.
Is that so?
Mhm.
My granny could speak it well and my great granny she could speak it and read it.
I don't remember her of course but I've heard my father and them speaking about it.
And could your mother?
Oh she never spoke it, er she was a lower glen but she didn't speak it.
And didn't like it either.
Mhm.
So roughly when do you think the Gaelic faded from the upper part 
Yes oh 
of the glen?
yes.
It er Oh it faded  er none of us Oh no  Just a word here and there, some of them spoke it.
Wait till I see now.
When I was at school which'll be eighty year, ago the people there er spoke it.
The the He was the old teacher and he and his sister never spoke anything else but the Gaelic.
You called them MacGregor and er he was good.
This MacGregor he was to be a minister, and he was a well educated man but unfortunately he'd made a mistake when he preached his sermon so he gave it up.
Why I don't know, but his sister and him never spoke anything else but the Gaelic.
Mhm.
I mind of them when I was little, fine we used to go in and see them.
So that was them, so that's eighty years ago.
Mhm.
And the upper part of the glen had Gaelic far longer than down the bottom ?
Oh yes an Yes.
From our lot, yes up that way.
But then it just all died out and died out and there was nobody then.
My father had quite a lot of Gaelic words, quite a lot.
So that was that.
But going back to some of these places you mentioned, were there any rocks that were given a name or stones?
Up w oh I suppose there would be, further up the glen aha.
You never heard any stories about certain stones having a
No a name no  no.
Oh there was the stone I ken, the big stones in the road up the glen er what we called the  Gled stane Er it's a great huge stone and it has a right story about it.
It 
Aha.
it was the th the old man that lived in er u up in Mount Blair, he didn't like the folk going to the kirk and he lifted this big stone and fell down.
So that's one of the stones is called the Glen  Ayloch the Gl the  Gled Stane mhm.
Again going back into your grandmother
Time, aha .
and grandfather's time,did they ever mention to you whether folk use to cross from Glen  Ayloch into other glens?
Oh yes there was a there was an er a er a right of way between Glen  Ayloch and Glen Shee, and especially out of what we called our hill.
I've walked it myself.
You walked out Glen  Bainey into Loch  Sheichernich and then down into Glen Shee, and er go out that way.
That was called Glen  Bainey And there is a stone out there a great huge stone oh that was called  Clachnagowan I've seen that many And if you went there you If you got the length of  Clachnagowan you looked right out the hill  right out to Glen  Bainey 
And who would be using these tracks?
Oh there was tracks There's is that and the fact er they can go out that way with their Land Rovers and things 
Mm.
now.
But you know in in those days  .
Oh no, they'd just a pony.
Mhm.
A pony or their feet,I walked it myself, but er  right out that way.
What a pony to carry stuff?
Er yes a lot of folk went out that way with their ponies  er in fact that's how they used to take the men when any Glen Shee person died in Glen  Ayloch they took them out that way to the kirk here in Glen Shee kirk.
Mhm.
Oh the dead er out that way.
I think about the last ones that was taken there was an old  man Ramsey that died at er Dalvaine, and they carried him out that way.
And when my father spoke about He got a holi they got a holiday from the school, that day, because the teacher came to see this old body going out the glen that's body and they walked out, so it'd be two miles out and then maybe another three miles up the er Glen Shee kirk here, so they had a good bit to carry him.
That was a Glen Shee man?
Yes and it was Ramsey you called him.
He was 
Mhm.
And  
he was an old tailor.
Mhm.
And that was that was how he wanted back to Glen  Ayloch back to Glen Shee.
There was other Ramseys too, that lived further up the glen but they were taken round on the road  way .
They  weren't cald cra carried over the hill.
So that was them.
Was there ever a custom mentioned to you whereby they  used to put a cairn down?
Oh there's a er er There is that there's a cairn there was A man lost on the hill of  Kilray and there was a cairn put there.
I don't know whee it is now but it was there.
Yes the and there's a place out Glen  Bainey er at the march between Glen Shee and Glen  Ayloch and there's a a fence er a gate or a steps at just the Glen Shee folk waited at that side to meet the Glen  Ayloch folk to take the coffin over the dyke.
Is that so?
They would they would never allow our men to go over but they would be there to take it.
That's most interesting.
And yes it was just an idea that they had, they were there waiting to take the coffin over the dyke.
They just wouldn't cross over?
No, our men wouldn't cross over with it but the Glen Shee folk would be there to receive it
Mhm.
And they would follow on behind but they wouldn't carry it.
Oh just funny old stories.
Now Elizabeth, who was this mannie you were mentioning ?
Oh the the the blind fiddler.
Oh he was a great lad what a great big strong looking fine looking man he was when we knew him.
And er he go was p partly blind, wasn't just quite but he And he'd two dogs with him.
And er he went round and I don't know I never heard him playing the fiddle, but they said he was very good at fiddling, but he was a grand one for old stories,, and er he was just doing farms here and there so Then eventually he turned so old he'd only one dog and then er he died down at the D At a place called the  Doonie And this man D Duncan, he had just an er one of the er I think one of the tramps from Blair Gowrie was working to him and he came up and told my father and my father went down to see about him, you see him being in the parish council.
And that was the poor old man he was just just about away so they sent for the ambulance and took him down to Forfar to  They used to call that the poor house, I don't know what they call it now but it was the poor house in those 
Mm.
days and er but And so the father saw that he was safely there and the other   Then when he came back he went into the house and said to Duncan er Was you speaking to the old John old John MacGregor and f He said I was that and he said I'll let you see  what my man got, and this was the little bag of gold.
You know he was that tramp must have been an honest man because father said there was quite a little of sovereigns in that, and so I suppose it had been given to the parish and had seen that the man was properly buried, and then they discovered that he was an Aberdonian.
But I don't know He was educated and all.
Cos he he When he liked he could speak very well but how he'd taken to the road I don't know, but he was well known er er as the blind fiddler.
When did er the blind fiddler pass away?
Oh that would have been  I think it was between the wars, I think between the time of the world wars.
Was after world war one anyway I mind of that, so say it might have been in the twenties he might have done I wouldn't say proper 
Mm.
but the might been that.
And he used to come for years?
Oh he came r he came round er e everybody and everybody was kind to him, just the sake of hearing him speaking.
Mhm.
But his dogs didn't like men folk,I don't know why if they d the men folk went near  the dogs would growl.
But if any of the women folks which I've gone out with a a bowl of soup to him many a time.
And er you could even stroke his dogs but er the er  I don't know how it is, he said, but they never say no to you.
Aha.
Where did he used to stay when he was up the glen?
Where'd he used to stay?
Oh anybody would take him in.
He used to stay a lot with the  Broughs at  Balnamenoch that was further down the glen.
And he he stowed with er stayed with the Ogilveys at  Fortar He stayed er at night, so that was Oh and he used to walk all over the countryside.
Everybody knew the blind fiddler and he had always his kilt on and But after a while, I don't know, the next time he came round I mind he had trousers on and we didn't think he was the same man at all,no.
Was it just in the summer he came around ?
Yes in summer times, aha.
So where do you think he went for the winter?
Oh it'll likely have been about Blair Gowrie or Pitlochry or some place, just anybody who would have taken him in.
but he he would never stay except, you know, it always had to be in respectable kind of a barn or something he would live in, least  And in fact instead of that he would ra if it was good days he would rather lie at the dyke side.
Mm.
You know he was an outdoor man.
so,
How about the old mole catcher?
Did you have one of these men?
Oh we did that, a great old lad  he was .
Mhm.
And I mean a great thrill he was to us, he cried come here and see this and here was among all his little moles, he had a white one a pure white mole.
I mind fine we all crowded round to see the old mole catcher with the white mole, mhm.
And I don't know it was truth he said I'm just collecting all the mole skins for somebody's mo For a coat, but that was just a story I think.
I don't know, but anyway he got the white mole, so he was delighted to see it.
He didn't live in the glen?
Oh no no he came from  Where did he come from now?
 Aylot h I think he did
Mm.
We did have a mole catcher in the glen, but he wasn't the regular, he just occasionally.
It was a man  Robertson, I think was his name, but he was the mole catcher.
Aha.
And he But he wasn't so regular?
No and we had another man I and I cried to him, What do you call him again?
I cried Will, I said there's a mole in this kitchen m mole this  there's a mole of this garden Will.
And he said do you think sh she would need a worm, meaning me.
And he cried do you think she would need a worm and he held up a worm, but he came and put this poisoned worm in the mole, you know that's what they did, they had er mole er worms that had doped with poison, you see and then they dropped them in the hole and that was the end of the mole.
Was there a custom in the glen for folk to go  ceilidhing to one another 's houses?
Oh that was that was always done at new year time, or at least It wasn't so much new year day as we called Yule Day.
That was the fifth of January, that was old Yule was  the fifth of January was January was y Old Christmas,er Chris er Yule Day was old Christmas day.
And oh Yeah, we went round from one house to the other and you A whole week of it it was more or less.
You know, you went there and there was fiddling and singing and dancing and eating and drinking and this to Party time all the way.
Throughout the rest of the year did folk visit one another?
Oh yes quite a lot.
Quite a lot of coming and going.
Yes and then we've fiddles or  melodions they all m met at each others houses and had great nights.
And were there certain men or women that were known for their stories?
Oh yes and they were great extravagant stories some of them too .
Aye.
Th What types of stories might be told?
Oh they would just tell you some extraordinary story they'd seen They'd heard Seen a ghost or heard a ghost or a something.
Mm  when he This man told a  great load of stories and in fact it began it was really thought true.
He always swore that when he was going over the  Baloch that's the the road between Glen  Ayloch and Kil and Glen Shee, he said i if you were at certain hour of the night he said as sure as anything there was a man on horseback pass you with this horse.
He thought he heard the clatter of it in the roads,oh it it had awful stuff of that kind.
But we liked to hear his stories.
Mhm.
I'm sure 
 
you could add a lot of your Glen  Uig stories to mine .
No I didn't know much about the glen at all But no nothing exciting enough to speak about.
You've more stories than I do.
About 
Well I was brought up on the story.
the the two brothers that went away and they were driving a car and one said to the other, watch what you're doing and the other said to him, but I'm not driving  so.
That was too  too that,
That's the kind of stories there is about her neighbours.
Aha.
Aha.
That was er Yes, two  and they were called Ogilvey, and one was  A e Alec and the other one was Will.
And it was Alec that was driving and Will  Will, he said mind where your about Alec, you'll er you'll soon be in a ditch but good's sake he said it's not me     So they were both  
about the other on be the pony, that took him to the wrong house.
Oh aye that's another lad he was on his road home the pony used to After a a drink in  Kilray In Kerry the the ponies nearly  took the men home.
But this lad make a mistake and he come down to the my sisters house,and my sister and her husband took him in and he'd fallen and cut his brow,and after he was kind of sobered up he turned down and he said  Not a story about this now James.
And that was to the horse?
No it was to my brother in law .
What did he s What did he say to the to the pony?
Ay No no.
He  that for he said he was that thankful 
 
that they had looked after him and that's how she leaned down and said not a story about this now James.
Very good.
So.
Were there any stories about misers?
No I don't think so.
er I  think there was something like that.
You know in older times about folk having stored up lots and lots lots of money?
Aye well this man that I ke know he had quite a lot of money and he just gave a six pence to the kirk, and he had always plenty of money when he died.
But to make up for what he didn't pay he left a hundred pound to the kirk.
Is that so?
Aye that's so, that's a s a long ago story.
Mhm.
Aye.
 

You you mentioned there about the old market.
We'd a curtain market.
Yes.
Aha.
That was long afore my day but th they used to always come to curtain market, aha.
It was a great day that day they came from  Lintrethen and  Kilray and the Blackwater and all met there with their  and their  or whatever they were to sell,a horse the day of the curtain market.
Mhm.
First heard father speak about that.
There were a lot of horses?
Yes er they days oh yes everybody had that.
And I've I've known I've heard of the Glen  Islan m men would walk out the hill to the market of Braemar, the Castletown market they used to say, likely going there for sheep or something, I don't know that was beyond my stories.
And what way would they take?
They would go out Glen  Baily and past loch and then right over into Glen Shee and that up over the Devils Elbow then.
Mhm.
It was a goodly walk.
That walk that I've one That I've walked it twice, gone right out Glen  Baily and right into Glen Shee and down Blackwater, down to the  and come along and round in, thirteen mile Maybe twelve or thirteen miles.
And did any of the the Glen Shee folk come to Glen  Ayloch 
Oh yes, oh there was there was no dance unless the Glen Shee folk come  along to it .
Oh yes there was great coming and goings between Glen Shee and Glen  Ayloch yes.
A lot of them.
They came to help each other especially at the clipping time, the time of the clipping the sheep.
Whether they came to claim their own or not I'm not very  sure sometimes .
Mhm.
Tell me about some of the old dances.
The dances, oh they were just great fun the dances.
All met in the  we met  the school.
It was the nearest to us and the next one was the Glen  Ayloch school.
But oh we we'd we'd a lot of good fiddlers in those days and a girl at the piano.
And then when things got a wee bitty better we used to have the Camerons up from  Kilray from Kerry to dance to the Play at the dances.
And of course the night of the Gathering Ball it was just packed tight with people, hardly the school would hardly hold them all.
And then they put up a big tent in the  Beside the school where you went out for your supper  er it was that.
S s 
And how many folk might be at the the dances?
Oh there was more than a hundred near two hundred folks would turn up.
A lot of them that came to the g to the gathering To the sports they would stay over just for the sake of getting the dance.
And where was that?
That was the tw always the first The second Friday of August.
It was the Friday after the twelfth was always the gatheri Glen  Ayloch gathering and is yet, and is going on for a hundred and s something year a hundred and What did I we say a hundred and twenty years since it was started I think.
And what about for recreation what did the people do er You know away back before before the great war?
Oh  For recreation, oh they made just er as I said, They did er throwing the pudding stone and they di the And the caber and if the p hammer, and er a lot of them used to play quoits.
They played that and then in the in the and in the evening there was a great lot of er  dambor playing if you ken what that is?
Draughts you know, but always father spoke about his   And er they did that and then there was oh great ones for meeting in their own houses to to fiddle.
They were great fiddlers of long ago it's not so long ago that I mind there was five fiddlers in our kitchen in Dalvaine, just each coming with a just to have a night at the fiddle.
Who who were the the great fiddlers?
Oh there was the Stewarts especially.
The Stewarts were always and Charlie Stewarts the last of the f Stewarts but they were all great fiddlers there was the Stewarts and er my brother was a fiddler my father, and then Duncans and their pipes.
There was a ma two boys played the pipes and er and the Thompsons were pipers, the 
Did 
father and the son were pipers too.
Did the fiddlers have any local tunes?
Oh I couldn't say for that.
You cannae mind some of the names ?
No no no no.
There's only one tune that I know and that was made in honour of my brother.
He was about thirty years as as erm secretary of the Glen  Ayloch gathering and somebody made up a pipe tune and called it Graham's Tune.
So that's the  only one I know .
Mhm.
That's just recently, mhm.
Oh there was Duncans and there was Robbies and there was Stewarts and MacKintoshes and Thompsons, all musical people, of long ago.
Unfortunately I wasn't blessed with that.
The only thing I was blessed with was the music in my feet.
Aha.
For I was very keen on dancing.
And what were the the dances?
Oh we danced all the dances you can think of long ago like Browns Reel, the Lancers and the Quadrilles and Jackie Tar, Rory More, Pluars Edinburgh and er Oh I think we've near named them all up and down.
Did you ever dance the Patronella?
Patronella was one of the favourite ones, aha.
You had to do that.
And Patronella and Rory More and er Pluars Edinburgh and Jackie Tar and er Quadrilles, Lancers and Browns Reel especially.
Eightsome Reel,and all the And then a waltz and one of those kind of things.
Mhm.
And a One Step, was another one.
Before I got my feet off I mean the doctor once said to me, What did you do when you were young?
I said, I worked hard all day and I danced all night.
You  Well he said, Well it's done you a lot of good now then because your knees are still good.
They're still right enough.
I I saw Mrs  granddad that she's got a new bike and I said I wish I could go that.
Now going back to the maybe 
Mhm.
what your grandparents mentioned to you ,
Mhm.
did you ever hear anything about this business of them distilling whisky?
Oh yes they we were great Our folk were great distillers of whisky.
My people, which is not a nice thing to say but it's true.
It was an extra for them to do.
And my grandfather and my great grandfather, they were millers you see?
So they had every ch opportunity of d distilling the whisky.
I don't know how it was done but they ha they apparently they did plenty of it,.
My father, unfortunately, he came on one of their little barrels out the glen but it was empty.
Aye.
Mhm.
It had been they had put it out to the what they call peat moss.
And put it in er er in the moss, you see it would mistur it would mature.
I think it would make about two gallons of whisky, I think he said, the little barrel.
And he thought he'd landed but it was empty, it had likely somebody had got it before him.
That wasn't what you called the a pig?
No.
No.
No.
Was there a name for these whisky barrels?
N don't know that I know just the whisky barrels they were, a little I believe there was maybe a name for them.
There used to be a great line of business up the folder part.
Yes, up that  yes.
Did you ever hear them talk about them smuggling the whisky through the glen?
Yes, they did that so my That old great grandfathers of mine they went fr from here to Arbroath with theirs over the hill.
Is that so?
Three or four of them, aha, with their ponies they would leave in the night and go over the hill.
I've a bigger story about the end of our stories.
A er and er it was kept secret for many a year, but er the just when they were, there the excise men came upon them,and this old ancestor of mine he was a big lad, over six foot, and he was quite sure that the man wasn't going to take his whisky.
So he fought with him and and took his stick from him and gave him a whack on the head and he dropped, and the story goes he says we'll go home now lads.
So they made home but whether he killed the man or not we never knew.
Mhm.
So that was the last And I don't think if he went back after that I think it had kind of frightened him, least so my father used to tell the story.
He took the gaugers stick?
Aye, and we have it yet, it's in the family.
What's it like?
Oh it's just a beautiful thing, really.
It's er it's like made of blackthorn and the upper part of it's all little knobbly  and a head like a a head turned in like a h like the head of an a of a bird.
And the door pit is about eighteen inches of steel and that was for them to puncture the thing, to puncture their whisky, little barrels you see.
But old Sandy we was sure he wouldn't puncture his.
Aye, well that's fascinating.
Aye.
And oh it was fascinating, yes.
And that was hid for many many years it had generations.
And I came across it in my young day when I had no business, but I begged it out them.
That was why it was ever brought to light so it's gone down to the next generation.
Did you ever hear the way they took the whisky to Arbroath?
They took it on their on their  They went with their ponies in their little barrels you see, and they went on horseback over it.
Wh what way did they go?
Oh they we I do Just Well I don't know they w just idea over the hills by the map, I don't know how they went.
But did they have their routes?
Oh they had their routes yes.
And they had to have their secret routes, you see the excise men would be looking for them.

And going on to the corn, the er  time when it was ripe, was there a test that the farmer would use to see that his corn was ripe for cutting ?
Oh he he knew that fine.
Went round and put his hand in to see if it was dry.
In fact if it was dry down to the band they would near take it in by that time, you with the bands round the middle?
Aha.
But oh they could rustle it and they'd they just knew by the just did this with it you know they would know .
Didn't they taste it?

Now wasn't it supposed to be unlucky to be the last in cutting your corn?
Oh there were never no word about that, no.
Now can you t tell me about how it was bound into sheaves?
Oh fine, it was just all You got this It was an art in making the band.
You got the band and you put them like that, and you twisted it round, did that and then it was a long band you see .
Now what was the band made of ?
It was the corn, you see?
You just took  two big handfuls of corn.
And they were awful thick.
And you did that with them and then laid it down, you see, and then you gathered your sheaf and put it on that and turned it round and gave it a twist like that and then And that was how it was done.
Tossed 
Now 
the sheaf to the side.
Was that done on the the same day as the corn was cut?
Oh just as soon as it was cut.
Mhm.
Just as soon as it was cut you In fact you'd to go er ev everybody, in that day, you'd maybe have maybe thirty yards and you'd all those l sheaves y that was your bit.
And you did that and then you had to wait until the the machine came round again and that was you again, you'd a whole day at that.
Who usually did the the band?
Well you could do your own bands, but you were awful lucky if there was only the bairns about, and they did your band for you.
If you made it and laid down them the the man that was doing it, he'd only to lift that and give it a twine and on to the next.
Mhm.
And what size was your sheaf?
Oh just a good arm full, a good arm full of a sheaf you would have to put down.
The man that was on the mower, they had an eye to that they would just wait until it was off the the Where it was cut you see?
He sat on the cutting machine and and then as it come on to the  Ah but what do you call the long thing?
E he just pushed it off with a long thing like that and and on they went and did it.
Mhm.
See?
Well what does a binder do then?
Oh the binder did that itself.
Aye wa the binder twines string ?
The binder Yes the binder could do that itself 
And then through off the sheaves  
Yes.
tied up with this string aye.
You see 
Mhm.
Now 
the binder was a great help you see it was on a a a Had the cutting and then it went on to the platform and the it went up
Aha.
and then it came down and then er
All tied up.
the Well the the cutter  slid down the cutter came out and did that with it .
Mhm.
Mhm.
The binder twine was in this thing you see and it went 
Mm.
over and then it tied it and then it was cu, then it fell down.
And then you wouldn't have to go round the fields doing the sheaves?
Oh no no.
Aye if it Well sometimes if the binder wasn't cutting it 
Aye.
properly you've to go  down  round and see about it.
Mhm.
Now you know at the top of the rick?
Aha.
Were the sheaves bent over?
Yes.
Can you tell me about that?
Oh but er they were they were built round and round and as you come up what they called the eaves of the sheaf the 
This is just the wee ones?
So.
and yes 
The wee wee stooks?
Er the stooks was Aha.
Aye that was it.
It's more the stooks I'm meaning, you know with the
Oh yes you had er the the stooks you had I think ten in a stook You had five five sheaves at each side you put them like that, five you 
Mm.
see and that was your stook.
That was like ten sheaves.
And was there one came over from the top?
No, no no ,
No no.
no no.
Just just a And you'd to set them right We had to set them that they've stayed like that.
Now how did you do that?
Well you just got into the way you lifted them and you just look  my elbows are.
Mhm.
You just lifted them you and you just set them like that.
Mm.
Was that to let the wind blow through to 
Yes.
dry them or something?
And then you just got another pair and you put another pair like that until you had five.
Mhm.
That was like tying stooks.
Ten sheaves in a stook.
How long would you leave your stooks in the field?
Oh just until they were dry maybe if it was a grand time of wind, maybe say three days.
And if it wasn't, My goodness it was a job when it come wet weather and it maybe be lying flat and it all had to be set up, and we had stooks for days.
You didn't weight them in any way?
No.
No no 
No.
that's more the bigger stacks.
Aye aha .
But What I was going to ask was, before they were made into a stack, were your stooks made into larger stooks?
No, no no, the stooks were just stooks all the time?
And then made into a stack?
Yes and then they've were  forked up in the carts, what the bogeys are nowadays, and then they would have made stacks and stack yet.
But with they the hay  coles that was?
Oh the hay  coles were different, they were different altogether  altogether.
Tell me about that again cos that was interesting.
Well when the hay was dry,th it was raked up it was all er When it was cut it was lying in what we called swathes, you see?
And then maybe after it'd been cut for two days, you were sent out to turn the swathes, up all you went along and you turned them and turned them.
And maybe next day you would have to turn them again t to dry.
And then they were raked into Well we just er If they were dry they were raked into big swathes, to be near where you could build the tramp  coles But if they weren't you would put them into little  coles and the and then they were the little  coles was put up t t together to make a bigger one.
And how did they they do that?
Well they just er they just forked them they they brought up the side what I said the boss, you see.
I don't know what you call the boss to be right drag point for  
Mhm.
Any way that was it and you st and you f forked them all round and you after it was er  up you was put up to do the tramping round and round and you Every forkful you took it and saw that it was laid down and tramped it round like this, round and round and round and then the next one, till it was up.
Now, why did you tramp them?
Well to keep it firm.
Because 
Mhm.
if you didn't the wind would soon blow them down.
Sometimes it  blew them down anyway .
But if they was good hay and that and you tramped them down they stayed for ages.
Did they not Did you not tie  rope over them or something?
Mhm.
And a brick on the end of it.
Sometimes a bit stone, aye .
seen you do that.
Mhm.
And did you  theek our tramp cole?
Yes.
And then they would er they would The tramp  coles then you would er put this rope up over that side, and then you'd put one over that side, you see, and that was that would be safe for a long time.
And after the harvester they would take in those big tramp  coles and bring them into the big hay stack.
Mm.
This great big round thing, the head of the er You've seen pictures of them.
Great round things like that, and up and up.
And how was it built?
Just the same.
It was built er It has to be It had to be very well built and firm, because then, when it was used for the cow for the er sheep, usually, that best hay was left for the sheep.
You got what they called a h hay knife.
A a great big thing about that length maybe and you cut the hay  in great swa After that and then you see you carried it out to the sheep.
It was a great art i in having a good hay stack, for the time of the winter time for the sheep.
Now under the lowest layer of the sheaves were there any stones or branches or briars ever laid underneath?
Yes they were, yes, under that.
Now what was that for?
That was to keep it aired.
That was to keep it aired you see?
Grand place for rats too.
Oh aye.
To keep them off the ground?
Aye.
But that didn't keep the rats off the the The rats went in supposing but er that was to keep the stacks aired.
And the stacks weren't built around a central pole?
That's the boss she's speaking about.
No the bo 
No.
no no, not a central pole, no it was just always a boss.
Mhm.
A big boss, aha.
And
Well in our district, why I suppose other folk had different ways but I just speak about our lot, aha.
There wasn't any s customs about the stack, that if you went round it er sunwise it would cure your  teethache?
No I never heard that stories no.
Mm.
Well that's very good.
Did you ever hear the word  stip Being used for a pole that was placed against a corn stack to keep it from  
Of course er 
couping?
Er Oh that was er  We called the things that supported the We called them  lairgs.
 Lairgs long bits you know,t We had them We had maybe four at a stack, to keep steady for all winter.
Mhm.
How how er long were the  lairgs 
Oh they would be ten feet long anyway 
Mhm.
long poles they were, they would be about that.
Was this local wood?
Er yes, we just Oh they were well looked after the the er  lairgs Some of them called them  staits 
 Staits?
 staits instead of  lairgs 
Aha.
Very good.
Mhm.
Mhm.
That was was something to stay them you see?
Mhm.
stay them s firm.
Aye, well there's a lot of old words there.
I told you that.
Aha.
Aye.
And did you ever use the expression, on a different subject, er a  burn sticks?
A bundle of sticks?
Aye, no.
Aha.
Oh I  my mother called that now   what would you call a bundle of sticks?
Just a bundle of sticks.
Aye but there was a way for carrying that.
Oh no .
Mm.
Was that done on the back?
Mhm.
What would you call that again?
Mother had Granny had it anyway.
Then it was  burden, but that wasn't the right word either.
That might come back.
Aye come back.
I'll mind it sometime, mind when your away maybe.
Mhm.
Were there any words to do with eggs?
My m my memories not nearly so good as it was.
Mrs  
 
Mrs  says it not bad for my age but there's lots of things I forget.
If I mean to mind a thing I never mind it
Mhm.
and then it'll come back just like that.
On the tip of her tongue quite often.
Aha.
So..
But your your mother had a lot of the old words?
Er she had but not so much as father.
Mhm.
But father had a lot of Gaelic words.
Mhm.
Mother had a lot of good words too, I must say, but er it was him we learnt a lot of wor And granny especially you learned a lot of words of hers.
Mhm.
Mhm.
What did you Did you have a word for grease?
 Creesh 
 Creesh?
No it was just grease, no.
Mhm.
We didn't use it often but I know what you mean.
Or cheese?
Mhm.
Cheese was a  kebick 
Mhm.
What was a sneck?
A sneck was a  snib in the door.
A  snib 
A  snib aha .
 
A sneck was a It was a lo Just a line of er a a piece

Was it You lifted?
Yes.
Yes.
Mhm.
You lift it with Had a a thing like that and a knob like this.
And it lifted up, and then fell down, you see.
Now a pinafore what was the word?
A pinafore, an apron, a pinny.
You never used  Daidle 
A  daidle My grannie used a 
Aye.
 daidle that was an apron, was a  daidle 
Watch your  daidle .
That's right.

Aye, mhm.
A  chuchet 
A  chuchet Oh that was er a  peesy  Chuchet storm was a  peesy 
Aye.
What was that name?
A  chuchet storm was the time we were just in from April when the  peesies were laying and there'd just a come a flurry of snow.
Just like what we had the day.
Aha.
Like that, maybe a bitty worse, but anyway that was the  chuchet storm
 Chuchet storm.
And that was always about the fourteenth of April.
Er today about the sa So if you see one you'll be saying this is the  chuchet storm.
How about if it was  smirring 
A  smir

Tape number one Hugh  final year student School of Scottish Studies.
Taping Hugh  my father on shipyard riveting practices.
Fifteenth of November nineteen ninety.
Is that picking up?
Aye.
It's picking up.
But he says it's got this wee arrow here's got to be in the middle of this dial, you know.
So er well If you want to tell me, if I was starting as a riveter boy, right, if I was  wanting to start as a riveter boy, what would I do?
Would I go to the yard or would somebody speak for me?
Well on a lot of occasions people were spoken for.
Aye.
Er by their fathers and uncles and brothers that 
Right.
who had already served their time er 
Mm.
in a yard.
Er as far as I can remember  er you would start as an apprentice riveter, and you would do sort of odd jobs within a s a squad, rivet 
Mm.
squad.
Er maybe heating rivets or putting in rivets, until such times as er you were deemed fit to become a member in apprentice squad.
And again apprentice squads done er lesser jobs than the the journeymen such as er riveting casings, etcetera, that were not on watertight and er filling in the odd er seams here and there that er were left out while a riveter was progressing with his job.
And erm  that would carry on until such times as when the foreman or whoever would deem them fit to be a squad that could carry out er a heavier job if you want put it that way, where they would progress on to heavier plates etcetera, and do watertight work.
But would a a erm apprentice squad  Was it known, or was it common, or was it known at all, for an apprentice squad to start off as apprentices like you start off in maybe four or five years become apprentice squad and work as a squad and do light jobs that you're talking about, would 
Mhm.
it be known then for that squad just to go right through the gambit and become a fully fledged riveter's squad and work for their days as a squad?
Or would they inevitably break up and go to work with the experienced squads?
Well it would be I suppose it would be possible that that they could start their time together and work right through for years together, but invariably er that didn't happen because  people were picked up and laid off as the boat progressed,er  and if er Y you may get a a run for the one yard would need, say, six squads of of riveters, in a hurry.
And you might get a a man that was er idle say for two or three month and the foreman would pick him up and say well, you know, can you put a squad together for tomorrow morning?
Mm.
And he would then go round picking up his mates and say er you know I need a holder-on, I need a rivet boy, etcetera until such time as he got a squad together, and that squad would start in the morning as a squad.
Mm.
But it didn't necessarily mean that they would stay together all the time the they may  they may even fall out with one another.
Er and one of them may decide that he was going to another job anyway, you know, and he would leave and somebody else would be brought in and what have you.
So it didn't necessarily mean that you get a squad of riveters that would stayed together all the time, erm for various reasons, as I say they may have been , unfortunately some of them might even die and therefore you had to make up the squad again
Mm.
So in that sense er very unlikely you would get a an apprentice squad that served their time together and went right on through to retirement age or whatever.
Mm.
Er invariably you would find up they broke up somewhere or other.
And would an an apprentice, like somebody who'd say served say five years as their time, once their time was out would it be common for them to be kept on?
I don't suppose it would be thinking about it now, because they would probably have to join the queue like everybody else, would that be right?
Once their time was out they lost their indenture or their indenture 
Mhm.
would be completed so therefore became one of the market type of thing.
Well unfortunately er it was the practice of shipyards for a long number of years, er to have maybe two or three squads of riveters that were kept in a yard on a sort of permanent basis, but you would invariably find that most of the squads would be sacked when the boat was launched, and taken back on again as they were needed.
So again an er because of that squads were never, or very seldom, er kept together throughout their their whole  working life you know 
And they were laid off I mean squads were laid off even before the boat was anywhere near finished.
They were 
Oh aye aye aye.
just laid off when  There was keel squads and
That's right .
sail squads and superstructure 
There were 
squads and 
there were there were riveters deemed to be shell men, or riveters deemed to be er superstructure as you say, where they worked on cases etcetera.
Ah  most squads were on piece work but you might find that you had If it wasn't an apprentice squad, you might find that you had a squad of riveters who weren't on piece work, who simply went round doing any wee odds and ends that had 
Mm.
been missed out here and there or
Aye.
whatever,
Mhm.
within the radius of er  what would you say?
A double bottom, say for instance, you you might get rivets that were missed out.
An inspector would go in to inspect the the tank before it was tested and he would back come out and say, you know, there's so many rivets missing in there.
Well there'd be a squad of riveters would go in and put them in before a tank was tested.
So you invariably find that they weren't on piece work.
They were on a make up system sort of thing where  they had a wage but it wasn't the wage that the the piece work squad would have.
Did they di do you think they  I was going to say enjoy there but I do I don't think that'd be the right word, but d did they like or did they prefer to work piece work or was it something that they loathed or I mean there was more money to be made at it wasn't there ?
Aha.
But I mean it was a hell of a way to work at the same time.
Well it was a system that er  wasn't liked but it was operated because, in my opinion anyway, because the employers er had seen it as a way of getting more work out of you.
Obviously er if er you came in in the morning and you weren't feeling to good, for whatever reason, then  you couldn't  slack back and say och well I'll just take my time with this.
You were on piece work you got paid by the rivet sort of thing, so you had to go ahead with it.
And therefore  it was a system the the employer encouraged but of course er I don't think you could say that  there were many people who were happy with the system.
Did they see it as working themselves out a job occasionally?
Oh aye aye er there was  always that  in the back of their mind that the the more rivets they put in per day, although it meant more money at the end of the week possibly, er it also meant that the the boat was therefore progressing or the ship was progressing that quick, that they were getting nearer the gate as the the saying went.
Er and they were actually bringing on there own unemployment.
So  what would a a riveter have done then once they were once their job was completed they were put on the the on the street basically?
Was it easier for them was it easy for them to pick up work or would they have been woul would they have to face a long time on the dole or?
Well I would say that erm, in my time, er when they became unemployed, most of them could pick up a job pretty easy because I was speaking about from nineteen forty eight onwards, and of course er it was shortly after a war, there was plenty of work, and therefore most of them could pick up a job in a reasonable space of time and they wouldn't be idle too long.
But I daresay, if you were speaking to some of the older men in the shipyard er who had worked in a shipyard before my time, that er a lot of riveters, a lot of tradesmen of all all kinds, found it hard to get employment once they were they were sacked you know.
In fact er on many occasions they would have to move out of town to get a job.
Yet they had this sort of erm  this sort of feeling about them that they created themselves, that they were sort of cock of the rock, within a shipyard.
Was that 
Mm.
based


purely on the money aspect or something else?
Well it it it was based er basically on the fact that they could earn more money than than most tradesmen in the yard at that particular time er I would say that.
They worked hard for any money they got er but basically this was the idea that they could earn more money than say a joiner or a plumber or whatever, and therefore they had a wee bit of pride in themselves   .
So did did they think they were doing themselves a disservice then when they, maybe when they amalgamated, or when they became part of the boilermakers, or when the boilermakers started taking in various trades to to approach the employers as a as a a black squad unit for wage rises and conditions and so on, or did they they Would they have preferred to have done it themselves do you think?
As riveters?
Well again going back to when I started my time etcetera.
Most people negotiated their own wage.
Er it wasn't like er  you know the employer would meet you and discuss a wage rise for a whole yard.
Most people done their own negotiating.
The riveters done theirs, the the joiner done his, the plumber done his what have you.
Er  and that was the system and of course the thing was that with the riveters being on piece work,apart from negotiating a wage, you were negotiating what was known as a price list, and er whereas you would get X amounts of  shillings or pounds for so many hundred rivets, or whatever it was, then the argument would be that that price should be upped because of the the cost of living going up, or whatever you know.
So how did the work out because  as far as I know the the riveter got the cash and then he divvied up the money between 
Mm.
the squad.
Well that practice did go on for a long number of years where the the riveter was the was the boss of the squad and on the Friday night, when er where it came knocking off time, he would collect the wages and he would divide that up between the squad which would be, a holder-on, a rivet boy, er maybe a putter-in, er again in my time, that was mostly a squad.
Other at other times you would have er hand riveters where you had maybe two riveters and a holder-on, and er a heater as they called, a rivet boy.
And again the riveter would be the th the charge of the squad, sort of thing, and he would divvie up the wages at the weekend.
So how did they decide who got what?
Well I  couldn't just  tell you  honestly about that but I think the riveters decided who got what, you know.
Mm.
Er  I never actually had any part in it but I heard tales about er  the rivet boy in particular,the they would er  they would give him a wage equivalent to what they thought  was was a was a reasonable wage for him, because of the fact that they were on piece work, he had to see that the rivets there on time.
Er in the morning he would be in before any of them, sort of thing, getting a fire lit getting the rivets heat up before they come on the job and ah the the quicker he could the the rivets heat up and passed on to the the squad, then okay the more they could put in so, if he were a good rivet boy you could maybe get a good wage, but again that was up to the squad up to the riveter.
So your wages could fluctuate week in week out with not really 
Oh aye.
having a great deal of
Aha.
er balance in t in terms of the amount 
Mhm.
of the work that you done.
It might just be  a good week or a bad week.
And maybe, dare I say it?
Maybe if you were a clever rivet boy you  you could get more wages .
Aye aye aye.
And the fact that it was divvied up in the pubs I 
Mm.
dare say quite a lot of it must have been spent in pubs as well.
Well, aye.
Er they say that's where most of it went on er they would go into the pub and the riveter would tally up the the sheet for the week and say well okay, that's, you know, the holder-on gets so much and the rivet boy gets so much, and the riveter got so much, and what have you.
Erm  I don't know if if I'm right in saying, but I think  they may have given a tip to  to other people like er the chore boy, there used to be a chore boy.
His job was to go back and forth to the store, from the store to the job, etcetera er up to the bin fill the bag up with chore take the bag up to the rivet boy and er the the chore was used of course was used to heat the rivets.
And was this a would this be a man that would do this or would this just be a boy?
On most occasions it would be a boy but I have seen men doing it.
Mm and did they employ like boys from school?
Or or was it did you have to be out of school?
Oh no you Well again er as I say I I'm speaking in in my own time, er and in my time you were left school before you started in the yard at all, aye.
Mm mm.
What sort of tools Did they have tools as such?
You know the way a carpenter took various, you know, trade in his tools.
I dare say a 
Mhm.
carpenter's tools are more sophisticated but they had
Aye aye.
tools of a sort.
Well y most squads had their tools, aye.
They they had er  they had hamme They had Again y Even in my day you had some hand squads, as they were called, who would have their own er rivet hammers you know, and hand hammers.
Well obviously they would look after them and keep them in good order, and what have you, so that there was no hold up with them trying to make a wage or whatever.
Er and when it progressed to automatic tools, all these tools were kept in a store at night, and you collected them in the morning when you went back onto the job.
Obviously most of them had them marked or had their name on them, so that they would have the same er the same set of tools every day.
Now whether it made a lot of difference or no, I couldn't tell you, but they believed it er  the set of tools they had were the best in the yard, you know, so obviously they took a wee bit of pride in them and looked after them.
And  do you think that the move from the hand riveting to the pneumatic tools, do you think that made the job any easier?
Well I would say Not being a riveter I would think it it did make the job a bit easier for them.
Erm but there again, riveting was never easy, so it it maybe took a wee bit of the the hard work out it.
But erm
I mean th they looked From the pictures they look fairly heavy like and I've never handled a a riveting machine but I've 
Mhm.
handled the caulking machines, and they can be If if you're working with them for a length of time, they can get fairly heavy and laborious you know .
Oh aye aye aye.
Ah well er riveting machines were a a pretty heavy item to be 
Mm.
worked with, aye, and carry about with you.
Mm.
Er but er  they devised various ways on their own to to help them with these things, you know, they er  I don't know exactly what it was called but you you would see a Maybe a riveter in below the in below the boat er doing the shell, in below the boat, and he would have a Like a hammer, a a an arm that was rigged up for him er to give him an assistance with the the machine, to hold the machine up to You know to let him work with the machine.
So they devised a lot of things themselves to to give them a a a helping hand.
And what sort of conditions were you working in at that time in the shipyards?
Were they, you know in, general you know not just talking about riveters, but in general for the the work the workforce?
I mean in terms of hours of work and tea breaks and whatever it is you had, you know.
Time for the toilet and
Well again er  I would say conditions were were terrible as far as I was concerned, er  a as far as tea breaks and what have you were concerned, you didn't have any what we would call official tea breaks, you simply took your chances and made a cup of tea and hid behind a bulkhead or whatever to to drink this, er if you got caught by the foreman or the manager or somebody, then you were more or less bagged on the spot.
Er so there was no official tea break.
As far as toilets were concerned er  the the toilets to me were absolutely diabolical, that nobody should have been asked to use them.
But there again er it was the time we lived in and  you had certain Well yards had their own way of trying to keep track of when a guy was in a toilet etcetera and sometimes you would have to hand in y your er your time ticket, to the toilet attendant, and you would give him this ticket and he would say right you are,you know, and mark down your number on a book and say to you, well you've got seven minutes or something you know.
So you had to be sharp.
But in general conditions were pretty bad?
They were.
Aye aye.
They were.
There was no doubt about that.
What kind of hours were you working?
I mean you started in forty eight 
Er  you're working forty forty five hours aye a forty five hour week.
And did  youse get any sort of erm protective clothing or anything that we got when I started in the yards?
Oh no 
did you 
no no.
Er all the clothing you had was provided by yourself, boiler suits, boots  er there there was no protective clothing at all, there were no protection for your hearing, er  there was no what we called leathers as such for er  to save you from getting burned with scales off of the rivets, with burning machines etcetera, there weren't there was absolutely no er protective clothing at all , unless you happened to be able to buy it yourself somewhere.
And would that be common?
Would riveters buy protective clothing for themselves?
Well they would buy  Were a a breed of men, as far as I know, used to wear what they called moleskin trousers.
They were er anybody that knows about moleskin, and there very heavy material er and apart from being hard-wearing, I suppose they, in the winter time, they gave them a wee bit of warmth in their legs etcetera.
Er and most riveters would try and buy moleskin trousers.
But again th there was no there was no clothes to be bought in the yard or issued in the yard or anything like that  you simply bought them in the shops outside.
Mm.
Er and bought you could afford.
Mm.
So the the conditions were really very bad.
Mm mm.
Well I think we're running out of tape
Mhm.
so we'll need to finish there but thank you very much Hugh.
You're welcome.
That's good.
Right if we could start again then.
How many how many can you remember off hand, riveters that worked as as family riveters?
Er the  brothers  the  brothers and the  as you as you said there, and the .
Then there there was the the ,big Malcky  and his father  big Wall Wally ,Many more wait I see 
Big Cassie mentioned a couple at me and I can't remember.
Mhm.
What their names are.
the   there were the  brothers too, Wee Woody and Abel  and Jamesie .
They all worked about the one squad you know.
And where would the All that the families you mentioned there were they all port families?
They were all port Aye.
They were all families aye .
Aye.
And was it common for riveting squads to accumulate out of families?
They were mostly made up of their families.
Most of the er riveting squads were friends or cousins or all They were all 
Aye.
kind of near related most 
Aye.
of the riveting squads.
So a boy coming up through a family that was involved in riveters would sort of more or less
Aye.
know that he was going to go into riveting squad?
He would, aye.
He would he would go in as a boy, but a rivet boy a heater as we called them.
Would that not cause any animosity  families working together?
No I don't think it
No.
I was thinking maybe when the money was getting split up you know?
No well it had to be a fair share out.
Aye.
With a riveter Two riveters and a holder-on, and then the boy got so much to the pound.
Aye cos if it was like family you could lay it on to family easier than you could lay it on to somebody
No.
If it wasn't your family you would need to come up come up with the dosh .
The dosh split out right no.
Mm.
Every  everybody got a fair share.
Mm.
After after the boy  The boy was paid so much to the pound then the rest was divided three ways by the two riveters and the the holder-on.
Big Cassie was telling me a story about a couple of riveters that worked together, a family, brothers or cousins or something, and er she says that the guy was a riveter, he used to Maybe if the guy was on the inside holding, on the riveter on the outside this I'm sure she said they were brothers, he would shout one of them from outside you know, shout his name and the boy would look through the hole you know, and he's  he would spit on him   he would spit through the hole  .
see you had to go out and look through the rivet hole to see who was shouting in you know.
  

There was another famous one, and all, about the  and his fingers ?
Mm.
Aye.
And the thing about Fingers was always black now with holding on to the thingummy and then putting in drifts, and hammering, your fingers was get er drift was always on a in a a pan a wee pan with oil in it, drift was always full of oil and you stuck it in the hole.
Walloped it in.
So sometimes I wallop it in, sometime the the other one would stick his finger through the hole, and the riveter would be  dying to be hitting it back he thought it was a drift you know .
Break your fingers.
Mhm.
See the likes of old Cassie talking there about the  the She was saying that pe people survived of of that.
Who all got a Co book?
Anybody that had money had a book Co book .
People that could afford to  but somebody in the family had a Co book.
So every family had a Co book?
No.
No.
Some of them couldn't afford it.
Some of them couldn't afford i You had I think you had to put something in .
I think you had to kind of build up
You mu You had to have so much in the Co 
shares to get a Co book.
Before you could er A black book you could get a Co book
Mhm.
what they called a pink book, you'd a pink 
Mhm.
booklet.
Mhm.
That they marked up your  bought a load of messages, so many
Aye.
two or three pounds worth of messages.
And you got a wee cheque.
This was written in this pink book, it was full of wee cheques.
And that two pound odd was writ into the This book.
And that was put in for your dividend.
You accumulated 
 
dividend and if your dividend had accumulated to so much you would maybe be allowed a black book.
You know, they called this a black book.
And you 
 
could use that for your own family.
You could lay You didn't have to pay that black book every week.
You could leave that to the end of the quarter 
You paid it every quarter.
and pay it.
And what sort of stuff did you get off the black book that you couldn't get the other way?
Well you could go into the drapery 
Well 
department.
You could go to the drapery, the hardware, the grocery, anywhere Gents clothing or anything like that.
Get everything practically that you needed  from a black book .
with a black book.
But you had to have it paid every quarter.
Soon as it came to the end of the quarter  
You know and if it didn't be paid you at the quarter it meant you di you wouldn't get anything the following quarter.
And how long did you get at the end of the quarter to pay this?
A couple of days.
It was usually up on a Tuesday wasn't it?
If the Co was up on the Tuesday you had to have it paid for the Saturday, at least.
On the Monday.
A Mond A Monday or a Sa Aye well the Saturday.
You know?
It had to be paid before the Tuesday 
Mm.
because that's when they tallied up.
All the books was er  audited.
Mm.
On the Tuesday the day that the Co was up.
And after that your  
If you If you paid it The Co was up on the Tuesday, you had to have it paid Most people tried to pay it for the Thursday and that was the turn of the leaf, on the Thursday and if you paid that then you could go straight away that day and get your new quarter stuff, for the next quarter.
You got until the Saturday to pay it, but if you paid it then that let you get the turn of the leaf and get more stuff for the next quarter.
And most people were desperate to get stuff in them days, you know they didn't want to wait till the following week so they tried to get it paid as best they could
Before the the end of the quarter .
So that they could get it for the turn of the new leaf of the quarter.
That new leaf didn't going into the next quarter and 
So 
the turn of the leaf didn't go into the next quarter.
Although you were still in the same quarter.
Mm mm.
No.
But it wasn't everybody that could pay it, it was very hard for some people.
If you let somebody else get stuff on your book, and some of them couldn't pay it, you know, you've no means of paying it .
You might pay it yourself.
Sometimes the people that owned the book had to pay it for them you know.
And wait to such times as they could pay it back,
Mhm.
you know.
That was why you mostly kept your black book for your own family.
Aye you didn't hand your book in you couldn't hand your book out to anyone, you know .
You didn't want to hand it, but there was people in the port 
 
that handed their book out to everybody because that way they got a lot of shares.
They got a lot of dividend .
and accum accumulated all this dividend, and they would have a right good black book you know.
Because a lot of money was going through there 
Aye.
Aye.
they would get a good dividend of it .
They got the good dividend .
Mhm.
They got so much 
 
to the pound.
So they would get When would that be paid out?
It was paid out
Every quarter .
Every well just shortly after the the the end of the quarter maybe 
 
the following week.
That the They would tell you what dividend they were paying out 
Mhm.
that for that quarter so the 
I rem 
following week you could go up to collect your dividend.
Mhm.
So er I remember it half a crown to the pound, but it was more before I remember that 
I =mem I remember three and three and sixpence to the pound 
Aha.
I think that was the biggest.
Three and sixpence to the pound.
So anybody that had a big book accumulated all this dividend 
Maybe three or four hundred pounds worth of stuff out .
But they had to take on the worry of people that couldn't pay them.
And was it common?
Very common everybody in Port Glasgow 
Mhm.
used it.
And
Everybody we knew used the Cooperative.
Everything was bought, you bought everything.
Th th In them days you hadn't got er what is commonly known now as hire purchase, nowadays, you know, that that mostly started after the war.
That would've been 
the only way of Maybe not the only way, but the the easiest way for people to er get debt, if you want to call it that, was er to use this Co book.
And of course erm for some people it became a way of living,and just 
For most people it was a way of living.
you you mounted up a certain amount of debt, you tried to get it paid by the end of the quarter.
If you were lucky enough to be able to pay it then you had the dividend that came along with that.
Aye that was the people that owned the book .
Er  But it took people  busy to get it paid, you know, and in fact there was some people that couldn't, er and it became a big worry to people .
Mm and what would happen if it came to the end of the quarter and you had so much money accumulated to pay on your Co book, for stuff that you'd got over the quarter, and you just couldn't pay it?
What would've happened?
Or what did happen?
Well the person that owned the book 
They would take it off your dividend.
what have to pay that they would probably have dividend and they would pay that for you and you would have to pay them back.
Aye.
But what if the person I'm talking about I'm not talking about 
If you owned the book.
the person who owned the book.
Mhm.
If the person who owned the book, regardless of who got stuff of the book
Mhm.
beyond that, if they had bought stuff through the Co and accumulated a debt on that book
Aha.
and couldn't clear it at the end of the quarter?
Well they took it off your dividend.
If if if it was like 
If you didn't have dividend enough to clear that you would lose your book.
You just So you just 
you'd lost your book.
So the debt would go then?
You would?
Oh no you would still have to pay that.
You're liable .
No no i if it was if it was the likes of a  say for instance, and I owned the book, it was my black book, and I ran up a hundred pounds on it.
Er and at the end of the quarter I couldn't pay that, then obviously you got no dividend on it because you still owed them that hundred pounds, but they would take the book away so you couldn't get any more.
Now that was a big fright to people in them times because if you didn't live within 
You were desperate  more.
No, most people used it to get their er their er their weekly ration in
But you were living on credit that was like credit to you.
Mm.
This book.
You had no money on the Monday morning so you would be in with the book and bought your messages.
You see you got you got 
You'd no money you just mark it up in the book.
Mm.
You got your messages week to week, it worked from Thursday to Thursday, right?
And you got a Your week's messages every week.
But the first week of the quarter you could get messages all that week which you didn't have to pay till the end of the quarter.
Every other week after that you paid them at the end every week ,
Mhm.
but that first weeks messages you didn't have to pay them till the end of the quarter, which meant that people went in and bought things that week, they never bought you know?
Mm.
Like f er dried fruit, chocolate biscuits,
Aha.
good polish and things that they couldn't really afford.
That was a great week because they felt they were getting it for nothing, till it come to the end of the quarter and then they had to pay it.
And  
So to get this You had to pay this, because when it came to the end of the quarter, you had to get your shopping out of that Cooperative, so that had to be paid.
Otherwise you wouldn't get any more Co er Cooperative messages, so you had to pay that.
Wh what was it common, I mean you were talking there about people would buy things that they never bought before?
Aha.
But was it common for everybody to do that?
Most people did that it was like er
A wee luxury.
A wee luxury a week a of luxury you know.
You you di you wouldn't maybe go over the score, but you bought things that  
What sort of things would you have bought?
Well I would have bought maybe dried fruit and er extra coal token, you know you bought your coal tokens and your milk tokens, maybe bought an extra coal token and erm maybe went and get a dozen cakes or something like that  .
What was the idea what was the idea of coal tokens and milk tokens, why didn't you just buy Why didn't you just pay for the coal and the milk ?
It was easier for the man that came round with the Cooperative lorry to just take tokens 
So you 
and you didn't have to deal with money.
Right.
You see?
The the coal man didn't have to deal with money because I think some of them was dipping into their bags you know.


Well I don't know about that.
So that's how they they made their coal cheques.
Well anyway it was coal tokens 
Coal tokens.
I always remember.
It was just easier for the the men that carried the coal.
Aye and of course the likes of milk tokens it Just like now, you know, they would come round the door and leave your milk there in the morning.
Aye.
Well at that time you didn't leave out money so you just left a couple of tokens  tokens 
And you weren't up.
in the the milk bottle ,
Aye.
you know and
They came round that early that 
that was that.
the coal tokens was The milk tokens were all right.
Aye and of course the same with the 
 
the the coal .
At that time you could you could trust people.
If er if you were going out and you knew the coal man might be round that day so you just left a couple of coal tokens out at the door or whatever.
And even left them with a neighbour if they were If your neighbour was going to be in.
And as your granddad says, there there was a lot more trust in them days and you could leave things like that at the door, unfortunately you can't do it now.
Was it common then for Did  youse have a Did you your family have a Co book?
Your mother and father?
Aye they did although it takes me a bit of time to think about it but erm they did have a a er a black book, aye.
But like that A lot of families had them and kept them just for the family.
Mhm.
You know, there was a lot of people had them and gave them out to neighbours or  not total strangers, but people that weren't really related to them.
Er and they were the kind of people that sometimes found theirself in difficulties, at the end of this quarter, as it's called, because  Well it wasn't everybody that could pay it.
Er people done it thinking that Och well, I've got three month to get this sorted out, you know, and then unfortunately, by the time the three months was up, they hadn't got it and
Mm.
it was kind of hard for them to pay it and that's were it came in that the people who actually had the black book would lose out on their dividend because their dividend would be used to pay what was owed by other people.
See most people had good intentions, whenever they got a whole lot of stuff from the Cooperative, they would say I'll lay so much by every week and I'll have it at the end of the quarter.
But er they would maybe lay it by for two or three weeks and then forget for two or three weeks, and then when it came to the end of the quarter they were a whole lot of weeks behind, you know, they couldn't pay it then.
It was It seems a kind of I mean it seems to have gone on quite a bit that people who had a Co book would allow other people to draw off of that, would go to the shops and buy whatever they needed of the Co book.
But at 
Mhm.
the same time it seems an awful kind of dangerous way to
Mhm.
to run your book, doesn't it?
You know, if if you didn't think you were
Well you see you were trusting people .
Good possibility of not getting it back you know.
Aye right .
You were trusting people to pay it if you had a black book .
You didn't actually let them run up a big bill, you would you would go with them.
Aye.
And maybe somebody would come to your door and say their wee boy or their girl was making their first communion, and they were in dire straights and couldn't buy anything for them, and you would more or less have to give them your book to help them out, but you would go with them so that they didn't go over the score and get just exactly what that  wain needed, you know, and just hope that they had enough money to pay you at the end of the quarter, you know.
Would Was there people who would abuse
 
Oh Aye  you had to  Some people would have went mad with getting them
just the same as you know ?
Aye.
You had to watch but if people came to your door in a in a state that er you knew it was a genuine case, you would probably help them out you know.
And did you have to did you have to actually When you went to the shop, say to buy some messages, or to buy whatever erm in the drapery or whatever ,
Mm.
did you have to actually present the book, when you went
Oh Aye aye aye.
Could you just 
No you couldn't get 
could you just 
anything without that book .
Without the book.
Oh no no, I mean there was people went and quoted the number.
Oh no they didn't allow that you had to have the book.
Ah but they quoted my number mine  .
Aye well that was a one off, you you weren't really supposed to go without a book.
Mm.
Then 
 
what was what was it happened to you then?
Somebody went in and quoted my number, and was it a suit they got?
I don't know how that happened, really but, erm you weren't really supposed to get anything without  .
They're supposed to It's supposed to be written written down in the in the book.
Mm.
Everything that you got out the Cooperative was writ down in this book
Mhm.
in this black book.
I think it always was Mostly always was you know.
Mm.
That must have been a one off.
I never heard of that before really.
You had to have your book.
And did some people use it like er  almost like in a like a money lending scheme then?
Aye.
You know.
Mhm.
Mhm.
They would allow people that they thought they could trust to accumulate a lot of debt on it .
Aye.
Some people had maybe as many as thirty forty people on their book
Aye.
Mhm.
But you had to take all that worry that
But there was 
somebody wasn't going to pay you you know.
There was people that actually made money from it, oh they made money.
You know if if you had twenty people using your book.
Then at the end of the quarter you were getting dividend for twenty people.
Now if if you were getting say, in them days maybe two pound a person,well you were talking about er get quite a wee bit of money every quarter.
And therefore that money would mount up.
Now maybe the person that ran the book didn't really need to use all that, so at at the end of a a year, say for instance, they'd quite a bit of money lying on that that black book .
Ah if if your getting three and tanner per pound for every pound that was taken out on your book, say four hundred pound, three and tanner to the pound.
Quite a bit of money, then it was a lot of money.
Mm mm.
So i if It was up to yourself.
You could take the risk and say well okay I'll try it.
So how big was a how big a institution or how important a institution was the Cooperative then, here?
Well everybody in this town 
It was the main thing in this town .
bought out the Cooperative, that's for sure aye .
Everybody bought more or less everything they needed .
Mm.
Everything.
After the turn of the leaf the next day when the the the new quarter began, every shop was queued from eight 'o clock in the morning.
And when you got into that shop there's maybe a counter for drapery and a counter for gents, a counter for ladies, millinery, every different kind of thing.
Every counter was queued out the door.
Aye.
Waiting
Mhm.
for things at the the beginning of the quarter.
That's how important it was in the port.
Mhm.
See there wee no big shops in this town at that time.
You hadn't Woolworths or any of these big shops 
No.
Cooperative was the shop in the town.
That was the main shop.
You would maybe
How did the smaller shops survive then?
The likes of shops that sold groceries .
Ah well that that was only wee corner shops you know .
It was just wee shops, apart from that.
Maybe Coopers and the Maypole.
Aye.
Aye.
Coopers and the Maypole aye .
And the Buttercup that was the other three shops.
What was the Buttercup?
Mac McSimon McSimons and er John  .
It's er just another wee store like er the Maypole and Coopers.
And was that  .
Just small grocer, nice wee shops.
Now they they were  We probably thought, at that time, that they were er big shops, you know?
Mhm.
Er because they were bigger than say Murrays.
Erm 
They weren't much bigger than
The next the next biggest shop to the 
was another 
the Cooperative was McSimons and John .
No, I don't remember them.
Mm.
where  is now.
Aye.
That was a great big shop, McSimons.
And did they do any Did they do a trade comparable to the Cooperative?
No no.
No because nobody el else give out tick.
See you get  .
You know , it had to be ready cash for all these shops, the probably did their bit when people had money, you know if you had a wee bit extra money.
But mostly it was the Cooperative.
And everybody in the town was in the Cooperative, you know.
Everybody went to the Cooperative Guild, all the women went to the Co Cooperative Guild.
What was the Cooperative Guild?
Well it was just a a guild for women who could take their knitting and have a cup of tea and discuss everything that went on in the Cooperative, you know.
You said what was going to happen next quarter somebody who's 
Well er 
maybe on the committee, you know, two or three on the committee.
And you took to do with the things that was happening in the Cooperative.
Said your piece and if you thought things weren't right.
So the the Cooperative was basically run for the people  .
Aye it was run by the people 
Oh aye aye up, aye.
and it had things on for children like elocution classes and
Aye?
Aye.
Highland dancing and stuff like that.
Aye.
You went to the Cooperative halls for everything, like that when we were young.
Where would these guild meetings be held then?
Well maybe once a week on a Tuesday night, think it was a Tuesday night.
My mother used to go to it.
Aye.
And you would have a a Co board as they called it
Some of these women would be on it .
which was made up of local towns people, you know, and and er I mean you didn't have to be a  a notary in the town to be on this er Co board th th You know you could be one of the riveters you were talking about earlier .
Old old Andy
too an interest in it  
Old Andy  was in Neil Neil  father he was on that board.
Mm.
And his sister, Andy  's wife  .

and  Melford my father's er mother's people were the .
 Melford was where he was in Canada when I was born.
And that is over ninety ninety years odd.
You see?
Mm.
So what years was that you were born?
Eighteen ninety three.
Aye.
And do you have any brothers and sisters?
I have one sister still alive.
I had er two brothers and four sisters.
But they er my two brothers, one died in nineteen forty.
The result of well wounds.
The other died at the age of What?
Oh about ten years ago.
Eight He was eighty nine when he died, and er both of them were in the family tradition, journalists.
And in fact er one My brother next to n to me I was the middle of them I was the youngest boy.
male they call it.
His son is a Was former corresponder for in New York for the Guardian.
Now he's on the editorial and Billy, my eldest brother he er was he came up  in Glasgow er  getting the Scottish Express.
You see so a branch of the er London paper and at that time he was editor of the paper, they came up together, found it here.
But one was on the Daily Mail and the other was on the er Express.
And er at one time they were on the evening papers, opposite.
They were they never worked on the same paper, they were always on
Rival ones.
Yes.
Ooh.
And my sisters  three of them were teachers.
And er an interesting thing   had been coming to our house She comes  goes to the same church.
And she came up on a Wednesday for coffee, after the service.
And she'd been coming to our house, Oh about fie or six years, and she said one day to Mary, that's my wife, says you know, Not  strange name, there's not many of them about.
So I says No, when we had the phone first we were the only one in the telephone directory.
And I says er you know when I came back from Rio de Janeiro, she'd been out as a kiddy then.
my teacher was a miss .
And Mary said Yes, that would be Eric's sister.
She was she taught in  Pennycook for quite a while, then she went down to Birmingham.
The other sister was er in High Wycombe,and the other one was in er Well she was in  Creith for a number of years,And then she moved south because she wasn't musical and there was no chance of getting of headmistresship in Scotland if you hadn't got music.
So she went down to  Spalding and was headmistress of er  School in Spalding.
Until she Well not until she till she until she retired.
She died a couple of years a er three years ago.
So er and ten the other one, the one that's alive sh she started off teaching and then went to nurse.
She wanted to be a nurse all her life, you see?
Mm.
She's a nurse.
She's retired now, because she's eighty seven.
Stays in  South er no not south .
And of course my father, he was in  he had a local paper.
Was he editor of the local paper?
Well he was editor, you know, in a a small time a small of er about five or six thousand.
Everybody has More or less has a paper  It's not like the Scotsman or the News, as regards numbers, but then you've got all the local news and you got all the local advertisements.
So journalism is one of the family, what if I say traditions?
Mm.
And where er abouts were you brought up?
Girran.
In Girran.
And was it a big house or?
Well it was a reasonable house, you know.
One two three three little rooms downstairs.
Upstairs there be there was four rooms upstairs.
But at that time it wasn't what you'd call modern in so far as you hadn't got hot water  from a sort of gas fir Electric heating.
The bath, you had a bath room with a bath on the wall  but you had to heat the water on a at the kitchen the kitchen fire.
It were a  old fashioned kitchen range where you'd got a an oven on one side and a boiler on the other.
The boiler didn't fill automatic, you had you had to fill it with water.
You took took a bucket of water out, you put a bucket of water in.
That's how you heated that's how you got your bath.
Heating the water, well it heated if you'd the fire on it heated the water and then you'd take a couple of buckets out into the bath, plug a couple of buckets in.
And then er
And there was no no such thing as electricity.
Gas  there was a local gas works you see?
That made er the gas locally.
But I remember quite well when the first incandescent gas mantles came in.
You know, what a novelty it was, and the difference in the light between the old single  gas lighter and the incandescent lighter.
But er some of ther some you had no gas up the On the stair way.
The gas The stairs were lightened with a a paraffin lamp.
You know  
gas in the bedrooms, so as the
The was gas in the bedrooms, but not on 
But not on the st 
not on the stairway.
Why?
I don't know.
Mhm.
There was warm gas er in the hall.
You know a gas er light in the hall but the less The stairway, you either had to go up by er with a candle in your hand, you see?
Or you got well er One two three four, there were four flights of stairs, in the one house.
You got a couple of lamps either, well in the one case where there was a small landing, a hanging lamp and the other bigger, you had a table, you had a an ordinary table lamp.
Oh yes.
And you'd
And you'd have the fires, open fires in your rooms.
Oh they were all coal fires.
There w there were no such thing as gas fires.
They were open coal fires.
And one Well all the bedrooms had er fire places, you see?
So that in the winter time you put on a a coal fire.
But there were no no such things as central heating and that.
And er where did you start school?
Girran.
Girran.
And what was it like?
Was it a 
It was  
small school?
No it was Girran High School was very good.
Very good school, very good  teachers.
The headmaster was Morgan J , known as Morgan J or by the boys as Too Long and Too Loose.
Why?
Because he always had long trousers that went over his boots, and they were you know, very wide so the boys would call him too long and too loose.
yes.
Ooh there were all all there were With one exception they were all male teachers.
The on the exception was the art mistress, she was a er Miss , but er Morgan  ,,,,, all good and by you couldn't you know they were disciplinarians, strong disciplinarians, there was another chap.
left Girran, went from Girran down to Oxford as professor of Latin.
And  he stayed there for the rest of his life.
And Morgan J well he was the headmaster when I went to school first and he was there when I left and he retired and he was still here You know going about.
There was ,, and another chap.
There were four headmasters and they From Not from Girran because there was only the one high school, but from er Prestwick, Glenbuck and that, and the used to meet on a Saturday at  Turnbelly to play golf.
They played golf every Saturday if it was at all possible.
And was the belt used a lot?
Pardon?
Was the belt used a lot?
No.
Because you didn't get the You know


One one boy might have  had the belt, say once in the week or a month, at Girran.
Very seldom, there was no need.
You know, you might get the belt for making a silly mistake over a sum, or some exercise or that, you see?
Or coming in coming late.
But it very The belt was there, now in the classroom the master had a desk and at the side of the desk was the belt.
It was always on show, but it was seldom used.
You know er very very seldom.
And how did you learn to count, can you remember?
Did you use the abacus?
How did you learn to count ?
To count , aha.
When you went?
You started, I forget  one, you know they'd put them on the bo It was all board and slates, there were no books, you know, no papers.
you had a a slate like you've got on the roof, but it it was bound with a wooden frame.
And on the board was a one.
And you out that one on your slate.
And then two, and you put the two.
Then add, you'd put a plus sign, one and equal, two and two plus two equalled four.
Like that.
And the same when it came to er subtracting, you see, it were all done on the board and you copied it onto your plate On to your slate.
And from that you learned.
And you had a bit of rage or duster or something, you'd got your slate filled, you'd just wiped it up, and dried it, start again.
So that, literally speaking, there were no records of your early 
er training in addition, subtraction and that.
When you went into the er higher grade, then you got jotters, because you had homework, so you'd homework to do and you'd, therefore, books.
So that you could er give your translation  you see?
Or  all that.
You had your Latin, French, if you didn't if you didn't take French you took German.
Your maths and your science.
And your  own jotters.
And your homework was handed in  every er so often, you know, you may have homework, English.
And essay, write an essay on this, that or the next thing, at the weekend.
It went into your jotter, your jotter was handed in on the Monday morning, or the first time you went to the eng the English class and the teacher  was his name, he went over that and if you'd missed out a comma, you see or a full stop or anything like that.
He corrected them, more or less, marked in up, and you got er four out of ten, five out of ten, ten out of ten.
And did you stay at the same school through primary and secondary?
Yes.
one school.
The on the only difference in, were different sizes of the room.
You see the primary was in the one side and the high school the secondary was in the other.
And were Did the classrooms, how were the classrooms heated then?
They were in desks, you had a long desk that took Now some of them they took five on the one the one desk, you see?
A long desk and a long seat.
No individual desks.
And the boys say on the one side and the girls on the other.
Mm.
And how were the classrooms heated?
Can you remember?
Well the classrooms were kept clean because the school finished at er twenty past four and half past four the janitor had the cleaners, you see?
Mrs A had somebody  Mrs B Mrs C Mrs D.
they were always they were swept every day and at the weekends.
One room would be the floors would all be scrubbed and polished, next week the next room.
The next room, then come back.
Every so often the rooms were scrubbed.
When you sat your qualifying exam to go to the high school, er what happened to the people who didn't pass?
They were It were divided into to, you could go to a high, or you could carry on at what they call supplementary.
If you didn't get the if you didn't pass the class exam you could stay on and try again.
that never happened.
If you didn't get it you went in to the supplementary.
If you got it you could go in to the higher, if you didn't want to go into the higher you  leave at er thirteen, you went into the supplementary.
It was er just er Well it was between, shall we say, the higher grade and the secondary school.
Continuation of further education on the secondary lines.
The only thing in the supplementary you didn't get was languages, but you got the the math, the science and all that, and English.
So did you enjoy school?
Yes.
It was good.
And did you have sport?
You had you had no organized sport such as you have today, but you had a football team because there was no need for what you would call sports ground, there was plenty of available open space, park.
there was the   Stead Park, which practically covered  the whole of our the er town you see?
You If you lived in  Stead Park, the houses in  Stead Park looked straight across the green onto the sea.
So that you've got football pitches there, with cricket pitches but if you wanted, if you were a golfer you went across to the golf course.
But there wasn't what you'd call an organized sports group.
If you wanted to play, class four would play class three, class three play class two, you know?
But the teachers didn't organize it?
No no.
You The boys organized it themsel 
The boys organized it themselves.
And as for girls, well er about the only thing they did was skip.
You know, skipping ropes.
And what did you do with your er spare time as a school boy?
I Spare time as a school boy, I used to play either football in the winter or cricket in the summer.
When I had spare time, but if you'd If it was decent weather you'd have to give a hand in the garden at home you see?
You had to help get the garden Keep the garden tidy, keep the weeds down.
It's alright at Although I'd two brothers, on or two would be away from home from home at the s the same time.
I was left.
So I had to give me father a hand, you know, to keep the garden, and he had plenty to do.
So er they'd find you something to do in the garden in your time.
Did you find that your father would have odd hours?
Well er sometimes he he made of point of always being in the house not later than We'll say nine o'clock, unless there was something special on.
You know a meeting of the town council.
Well if there was a meeting of the town council it would perhaps start at eight o'clock.
Because quite a l a number of members of the council had businesses and you didn't shut at six o'clock, it was seven or eight 'clock before they closed.
And if there was a town council meeting it might go on till ten o'clock.
So if the e You know it was only er exceptional cases when he was late.
Did the paper er he had out every day?
No it was a weekly paper.
A weekly paper you see?
And er later on when he Well he got that he couldn't carry on with it, you see.
It was absorbed and went in to the  Carrick Herald and the Aire Advertiser, and now they've all gone.
I don't think there's a sort of local paper now.
Course I haven't been down that way for a while.
And when you left school what er age were you?
I was between fifteen and sixteen.
And what did you go What did you do?
I had a relation with a chemist business in Motherwell.
And er i didn't know him, you know, my Mother  He was a cousin of my Mother's you see, and on call now and again.
It wasn't like today, you could get in the car and nip down.
To get to Girran you've got to go into Glasgow and get a train from Glasgow down to Girran you see?
And that was er an express train was two hours journey.
So And er I smelt, you know, and I went by a chemical  and I thought  Oh  oh, grapes, the the odour you see?
And that drew me.
The aroma that exuded from the chemist shop in those days like er Depends what they'd been using you see?
They'd been making er some mixed powder, fenugreek or something like that you see?
You get the aroma of it.
And er well there were three chemists in Girran  W K , Archie  and  Gib .
Well W K  never took an apprentice, he wouldn't you know, he hadn't time, he had a permanent assis assistants like.
He wouldn't he wouldn't take in ion an apprentice, it was too much.
So I got in to  Gib n as an apprentice on the second of August, nineteen twelve I think.
Nineteen and eleven or twelve and er he was a figure in the b in the town, when I tell you, you won't remember the  who were members of parliament for Orkney and Shetland.
And if Punch were ever stuck he would get a cartoon of er one or other of the brothers sitting in parliament knitting.
You know whistling and knitting.
Well this man  something wrong and he er had an appointment with a Girran man who was Professor of medicine in Glasgow, he'd gone up the ladder you know and finished.
And he made an appointment.
Well  came from  Bar which is er a matter of six miles, six to eight miles out side Girran and you'd got to come in by foot or by trap.
In those days he came in with a His coachman brought him in the trap and they got the twenty minutes past seven express train to Glasgow.
Well er he saw the Professor and paid the fee and that and then came back six =clock at night, he came into the shop.
And he said he says  Is er  Gib in?
Well the assistant said no er Ah he's upstairs getting his tea.
Stayed above the shop, you see?
In the house.
But he said wait a minute I hear him coming down the stairs.
So the boss came down the stairs and into the shop and he saw  Oh hello, well did you get on with the  Your examination?
Ah well he says,and he said he's given me this list.
If you can't get If you  give me something of your own.
After he travelled to Glasgow, he had more faith in the  He'd more, you know,
Mhm.
if  had said Oh this isn't worth a damn, take this, he would have taken it and been happy.
Mhm.
And Oh  No he said, this'll be good, you know.
So can you remember your f your wage when you went first?
When I started first it was five pounds a year.
And were you paid at six months or were paid every  
No  paid every three months.
 
And invariably you got a gold sovereign, you see?
And er what,four   the rest  I think it was one pound five a Twenty five shillings every three months and you got a sovereign and often a five shilling piece.
If you didn't get the five shilling piece you got two half crowns.
Then it  gradually went from five pounds to ten.
There was a five pound increase every year you see?
And what er was your job when you first started?
When you first started you had the hallmark of an apprentice of black apron with a bib on it.
You know er you see some of them with the apron that just goes round the waist.
But this one came up over neck, over your neck, and then down here and strings there.
And you did two years as an apprentice then another would come in and you dropped the bib and got a black apron.
When your apprenticeship was finished, you got a white apron.
How long was the apprenticeship.
The apprentice varied three years up to, some of them were five.
And what did you do as an apprentice a at first?
I The first thing you were shown, taught to do, was to wash the bottles.
You know, empty medicine bottles.
You washed them.
The er apparatus,measures, slabs, mortars, that were used for making compounds or dispensing medicines.
They were put on the sink and you washed them.
And dried them and put them on the rack again.
And gradually  dust or you've seen these er chemist shops where you've got lots of er drawers in.
Well in my day, all those drawers had the natural drug.
Aconite root,inside was a small cardboard label, you see?
Giving the whole story  Rad aconite, beruncial assay Britain, habitat Britain.
use, root, liniment, you see?
And you had to do all that dusting and keep it and you'd read over all these things, every time you dusted until you got to know them.
That was 
 
one of the ways of training you or breaking you in to what was materia m the materia medica of the pharmacy.
If he today er you don't hear such thing as aconite liniment, belladonna liniment.
Extract of bella belladonna.
Dandelion juice, Succus delaxica they've been replaced.
Then, you see, at certain periods of the years herbs were common, bloom, which a lot of it was used.
You used to go with the boss.
The boss would cut the bloom, you would put it into the sack, bring it back to the shop and dry it.
You might go and collect, oh  er what  Coliupe Collium, Collium Maculatum,spotted   come up, you'd go and cut it, you know, bring it in, get the  Succus Conium that would keep you going, you know, sometimes he would he'd say Oh blast you, we used two garlands of it.
We better get three garlands this year in case.
Ooh we made three garlands last year, we've got two garlands left, we'll not bother.
But a lot of the herbs were collected and dried and er used.
So it was organized collecting of
Well the  usually collected himself.
Er we was on the beach, you know sea front, he'd er gathered some er brands of seaweed for making what they call Irish moss, Caragium And that would give you a good  think emulsion, you see then in the, what was the cod season, cod fishing, you'd go down to the harbour where the er fishing boat came in and where they were cleaning, and you'd get the boss would have arranged that you get the cod's livers.
Take it back to the shop, in You've seen these old milk churns.
Well I fill the milk churns with the livers and take them up to the shop.
Go back and get another, you see?
Get another.
Make your own, produce your own cod liver oil.
Gosh.
And er there were two grades of it.
There was the the cod liver what would for animals, that well, the method that used to be used, put it into the copper boiler.
A big copper boiler, with a little warm water and the heat would separate the oil, you see?
And then skim the oil off and drain it.
What extra did you have to do for humans?
Well you were always One thing you were very careful, you had to see that the gall bladder was removed.
that it was just the liver.
And sometimes you just used pressure, you see?
Put it in and screw it round and round and round, so that the pressure would fetch out the oil.
I can remember when the er Going down to the harbour for salt and we were getting from the manufacturer, it was  at the time, getting cod liver oil, you know, ready prepared for us which was a quite a saving.
As far as we were concerned.
In labour.
But er you had all like cold cream, special hairs tonics, rosemary , Eucalyptus hair tonics.
You made those in the back shop.
And having made a couple of Winchesters, that's er the big bottle, which was er eighty ounces.
They were filled into two ounce, four ounce or, you know, depending on the size you you stocked and sold.
Are they The chemist then would have to buy in all the bottles.
Oh he bought in the bottles, you see?
And er y you gave in perhaps say er two gross of three ounce bottles, two gross of two ounce bottles, four gross of four ounce, depends how they were used.
And they were stored in the back in the back shop store, you see?
And er kept there, then you had in the front shop, you had a range of er hair er  drawers with your drugs, your  drugs at the bottom.
you pulled it down ad you got the various size bottles in this we got half and one ounce, here two ounce, further up three ounce.
All the way round.
When you got the bottles did they have to be cleaned?
Yes.
Cleaned and dried.
So it was a lot of work?
Oh lot of work.
I mean the bottles weren't what you'd call dirty, from having contained medicine or anything like that.
They were dirty from  transit you see?
And packing.
So that they just needed more or less  scrubbing out and put on Put into drainers, you know just a big piece of wood with holes cut in so that you could fit them in and wouldn't fall off, and dry them over the heat.
What did you use to heat?
There's only source of heat.

remember what it was like during the nineteen twenty six strike ?
The nineteen twenty six strike, the o the thing that struck me most of all was, they were going to  out the railway men.
And at that time the railway was It was private.
And the leading man of the railway union went out and bought all the shares he could get his hands on and off the railway company.
And he'll not come out on strike.
And that's And er it was the railway men not coming out on strike that caused the collapse of the strike.
But there wasn't much interference in in Edinburgh.
As far as I can remember.
I mean we could get about, we got about alright.
There's 
 
There was food and all that available.
Oh no I the twenty six strike er is just a You know a very very big and er  you know er railway man, leader of the strike, buying all the shares because he was But that's one of the things, because it was a headline in the

And you wouldn't say that was No.
How do you feel, the sort of looking back on life, sort of the difference now u when you were young?
Well, how do I feel?
I'm grateful that I was born when I was, rather than being a youngster today.
Although I have Well I've come through two wars and I remember the relief of  Mathaking but I'd sooner that I've was born when I was.

Well today it I may be wrong, I hope I am, but it seems to me, everybody is out, you know, oh he gets five bob I want seven and six, he get's seven and six, I want ten.
And there seems to be dissatisfaction, greed, I dunno what amongst the youngsters today.
And what did you do as er your leisure time as a a young man and?
Well, you hadn't got a great deal of money, now  you would go for a walk out in Edinburgh, out to black  Blackhole because  Blackhole was a village.

It was very easy, I could walk up to  Ravelston nine holes, walk back in time.

I never felt time hanging.
Ooh well you got er a l a lecture a couple of lectures every day, well you You couldn't just er press a button and they came out, you got er preparation work.

Yes.
And 
 
I made many of my own students are still friends.
Now  we're a bit off Christmas, we've  We have had Christmas cards from Norway, Indonesia, Mauritius, Northern Island not to mention the er Scotland and England.
But these are from students of  well past days.
So it's very nice.
So well er I had students and they left at as friends.

Well they were they were coloured, well it didn't matter to me.
My wife kept an open door for them and any time Well at the weekend they'd Some of them would drop in, you know, for a chat, aye.
Or drop in for tea or supper.
I was much more, well  I'll not say interested altogether, but much more thoughtful of the condition of er these coloured people.
Why?
Well a  biddy ago now, a Nigerian came to Edinburgh, a student, went to the regular places.
No no to let, advertising accomo They wouldn't have him, well what's that?
What impression is that going to have on that laddie?

That that you lectured to?
Well the classes remained steady.
You know we could've We limited They were limited to the intake, but we could have er increased I think.
We kept a steady increase, you see when the two year course stared first, I think we had eight students, and then it grew, you see.

Strike violence
The 1984–5 coal dispute was one of the most bitterly contested strikes in British industrial relations history, involving violent industrial confrontation on picket lines in the North of England, the Midlands, Scotland and South Wales.
The most notorious confrontation took place around a coking plant at Orgreave, near Sheffield.
From 23 May, when the first brick smashed through a lorry windscreen, to the final cataclysmic encounter almost four weeks later on 18 June, the violence rose in a series of tidal waves.
Thanks to television…the nation had an armchair view of the violence: uprooted telegraph poles, rolling down the hill towards the police cordon; a workmen's hut dragged into the road and going up in petrol-fed flames; a lone policeman with his truncheon repeatedly laying into a recumbent miner; the wall of riot shields parting like the Red Sea as groups of police, in black one-piece suits and NATO helmets, dashed into the crowded pickets while a senior officer, with loud-hailer, encouraged them to ‘take prisoners’.
(Wilsher et al., 1985:88)
Mounted police officers, long, wooden batons in hand, cantered off to join in the chase.
Many pickets fled; others stayed to fight.
Men with blood streaming from their head wounds stood defiantly hurling stones.
A police rider fell from a horse stunned by a half-brick.
Constables with small, round, Perspex shields, like latter-day gladiators, engaged in hand-to-hand combat with miners.
Helmeted ambulancemen loaded casualties into an armoured Land Rover, bought for the purpose from the army.
Smoke from a burning barricade further up the hill hung in the air.
Often only the absence of sabres and bullets differentiated it from full-scale war.
(Wilsher et al., 1985:89)
One year beforehand at Warrington in Cheshire, and 3 years after at Wapping in North London, violent clashes occurred on picket lines involving print workers.
Why had such disputes reverted to a pattern of disorder more reminiscent of the nineteenth than twentieth century?
Geary (1985) has examined the historical pattern of industrial confrontation in Great Britain, looking for the distinctive features of periods marked by high or low levels of disorder.
We begin this chapter with a discussion and critique of his model of the changing nature of industrial confrontation from 1893 to 1985.
In the second and third sections, we concentrate on our contemporary example, an extended case study of public disorder during the 1984–5 coal dispute.
We set out the political context of the strike (second section), before analysing the most notorious mass picket of the dispute, the ‘Battle of Orgreave’.
American labour-management relations have shown similar patterns.
From the 1870s to the 1930s, violence was ‘pervasive and intense’(Graham and Gurr, 1969), but has been less common since the Second World War, with notable exceptions, such as the major coal-mining strikes of 1977 and 1981.
The fourth section is devoted to an overview of American ‘labor violence’ from the 1870s to the 1980s (Taft and Ross, 1969; Thieblot and Haggard, 1983).
A final section evaluates a recent Canadian explanation of ‘Why strikes turn violent’(Grant and Wallace, 1991), discussing its relationship to the flashpoints model.
STRIKE VIOLENCE IN GREAT BRITAIN, 1883–1985
Between the late-nineteenth century and the 1980s, there was a progressive decline in the occurrence of industrial confrontation only for it to dramatically reappear between 1983 and 1985.
According to Geary (1985) this history went through five distinct phases, each characterised by its own dominant form of disorder by strikers and preferred type of control tactic by the police or military.
The first of these periods (from the late nineteenth to early twentieth century) usually involved confrontations between stone-throwing strikers and armed troops, who would sometimes resort to gunfire to restore order.
This period is exemplified by the Featherstone shootings of 1893, where troops opened fire on a group of miners involved in a lock-out, leaving two dead and fourteen wounded.
In the second phase (1910–14), baton-wielding police sought to protect strikebreakers from the wrath of pickets.
This was, in Geary's terminology, a pivotal period, in which the responsibility for controlling public-order situations passed, backwards and forward, between central government and  local employer-magistrates.
Although the military were used more sparingly than in period one — the government intervened to prevent their use in the South Wales coal dispute of 1910, for example— they were despatched to South Wales during the national railway strike of 1911, when fears of imminent revolution were rife.
Between 1915 and 1945 (period three), picketing was largely non-violent.
Any disorder that occurred, as in the General Strike of 1926, was directly due to provocation by the police and Specials (volunteer constables), involving repressive baton charges.
Such tactics were carried out and sanctioned in a ‘political atmosphere of panic’.
During period four (1946 to 1980), violence between pickets and police was quite rare.
Geary points out that, by this stage, picket-line behaviour had evolved into a ritualised pushing and shoving.
Perhaps the most famous cases of this period were the confrontations at the Saltley coal depot in Birmingham during the 1972 national coal dispute, at the Grunwick film processing laboratory in London in 1977 and outside the Hadfields private steel works during the 1980 national steel dispute.
According to Geary,
the picketing at Saltley — often presented as a extreme example of industrial violence — consisted of large numbers of strikers pushing against smaller numbers of police.
Such behaviour is hardly the ultimate manifestation of anarchy that it is often depicted to be.
(Geary, 1985:78)
At Grunwick, elbows and boots were used, especially when snatch squads entered the crowd to make arrests, but ‘the general pattern of picketing was one of relatively non-violent pushing and shoving’(ibid.:86).
Although the media coverage of Hadfields suggested a violent encounter between police and pickets, even on the most serious day of violence, 12 March when seventy-five arrests were made, the confrontation was relatively tame (ibid.:90–1).
The last of the five periods identified by Geary is the 1980s, when industrial confrontation reverted to a more violent form.
The first indication of this change occurred in 1983 during the closed-shop dispute between the National Graphical Association (NGA) and the Messenger Group of Newspapers, owned by Mr Eddie Shah.
The largest mass picket of the dispute, 4,000 people, assembled outside the company's Warrington print works on 30 November to make its ritual attempt to block the route of newspaper delivery vans.
Previously, picketing had taken the form of pushing and shoving on both sides, but the confiscation of union banners and the pickets' public address system by the police led to the throwing of  stones and bottles by strikers.
This was the prelude to an aggressive baton charge by police in full riot gear which resulted in seventy-three arrests (Geary, 1985:135).
This willingness by police and pickets to engage in violent confrontation was dramatically revealed during the 1984–5 coal dispute.
Geary attempts to explain both the long-term trend away from violence and the sudden return to it in terms of three socio-political developments: the increasing constitutionalisation of trade unions and the police, the growing impact of the media and the progressive democratisation of civil liberties.
The constitutionalisation of the trade unions and the police refers to the former's growing commitment to procedural settlements and closer political alliance to the Labour Party, and to the latter's growing independence from local political control.
Unions are more wary of the need to avoid jeopardising the Labour Party's (and their own) interests by engaging in violence, and therefore are more apt to exert control over their members.
Correspondingly, the police have become gradually more independent of local capitalist interests.
The Home Office directs the police, rather than(as used to be the case before the First World War) local magistrates, many of whom were owners of local industries, with a vested interest in the breaking of strikes.
Geary maintains that both the police and trade unions are committed to carrying public opinion.
A second factor, the growth of the media, is said to have made both sides wary of possible bad publicity resulting from violence.
The media are held to have played a key educational and civilising role — by keeping people better informed of the issues involved in industrial disputes and of the ‘proper’ way to conduct them.
The third factor has been the democratisation of civil liberties.
The monitoring and criticism of police conduct on picket lines by such independent organisations as the National Council for Civil Liberties has served to highlight, and therefore moderate, misbehaviour, especially by the police.
Geary explains the return to tactical violence in the 1 980s partly in terms of the police's tougher and more sophisticated approach to public disorder induced by the inner-city disturbances of 1981, though he attributes much of the unusually high level of violence in the miners' strike to certain exceptional characteristics of the dispute:
It seems that several unique features — the lack of wholehearted support from other unions, the marked absence of internal unity, the militant leadership, the sheer length of the stoppage — prevented the constraints  on violence which had proved so effective in the past from being fully operative.
(Geary, 1985:147)
The success of the police strategy — involving roadblocks and the central co-ordination of riot-trained support units — caused the pickets to rely increasingly on stoning tactics.
This was the prelude to a spiral of conflict.
Picketline disorder eventually spilled over into mining communities, which became the sites of major disturbances.
Though impressively coherent, Geary's model is open to three important criticisms.
First, as will be demonstrated below, he tends to underplay the severity of the violence which occurred at places like Grunwick and Hadfields during a period supposedly devoid of such conflict.
Second, he clearly misunderstands the media's role in relation to industrial disorder.
Typically, media coverage refers only superficially (and usually disparagingly) to the issues involved in a dispute and, far from moderating police aggression, tends to justify hostility towards the pickets.
Ultimately, Geary's general argument is politically superficial Jefferson, 1990).
His explanation should have been more sensitive to the interplay between local and national democratic influences on the policing of industrial disputes.
Greater emphasis should also have been placed on the economic context in which disputes occur and on the state of political consensus — primarily, whether the trade unions are accepted in a ‘partnership’ role with the state, or are defined as problematic to its objectives (Ragin et al , 1982:243).
By briefly reconsidering the major industrial disputes covered by Geary's final two periods, it will be shown how it is more advisable to explain the characteristics of the key industrial confrontations of the period in terms of the specific audiences influencing police behaviour.
This overview will serve the related function of showing the gradual development during the 1970s and early 1 980s of a climate of opinion, antithetical to trade unions in general and mass picketing in particular, which was conducive to the repressive police tactics deployed during the coal dispute.
THE CONTEXT OF THE COAL DISPUTE
Political antecedents
Geary is undoubtedly correct to highlight the mutual restraint shown by the police and pickets at Saltley.
At the peak moment of the 6-day picket of the coke works, 800 police officers found themselves containing 15,000  pickets.
The depot was closed by the police in the interests of public safety.
However, as Scraton points out,
That one incident was taken as the moment when the predicted breakdown in law and order, the full-blown crisis in industrial relations, had arrived.
It symbolized the potential power and solidarity of the unions and demonstrated that collective action on a large scale could close workplaces.
It was also clear from the Saltley Gates confrontation that the police, regardless of their offensive tactics, were not capable of handling well-organized mass pickets.
(Scraton, 1985a:143)
This panic stimulated a reconstruction of government mechanisms for responding to mass picketing.
First, central government set up the Civil Contingencies Unit (CCU), a formal institution based in the cabinet office whose brief was to monitor and respond to industrial disputes in key industries.
Second, a greater emphasis was placed on the provision of mutual aid between police forces, an operation to be co-ordinated from the National Reporting Centre (NRC) at Scotland Yard.
In February 1974, there was a second national miners' strike.
The Prime Minister, Ted Heath, called a general election, based on the slogan, ‘Who runs the country?’.
The Tories lost the election, misjudging the mood of the electorate.
The spectre of Saltley haunted the right of the Conservative Party for another decade.
The Tories' period of opposition was partly spent contemplating a future showdown with the miners.
The Ridley Report (cf The Economist , 27 May 1978) was the blueprint for a possible strategy.
It advised a future Conservative cabinet to:(i) build up stocks of coal at power stations;(ii) plan contingency coal imports;(iii) introduce dual oil and coal-fired burning in power stations;(iv) cut the social security entitlements of strikers; and finally,(v) set up mobile police squads to deal with flying pickets and obtain sufficient numbers of ‘reliable’ non-union drivers to cross picket lines.
The next major episode of industrial conflict took place at the Grunwick film-processing factory in London, where workers — a high proportion of them Asian women — were demanding the right to unionise.
If anything, Geary underestimates the ferocity of the encounters between pickets and the police.
According to Dromey and Taylor, it was clear from first day that the police:
intended to interpret the law rigidly and arrest en masse those who did not instantly obey their dictates, however unlawful….
Forty pickets were arrested within minutes as the police emptied out of their coaches  and were ordered to pile into the pickets, hem them in either side of the factory gate and arrest anyone who stepped off the pavement.
(Dromey and Taylor, 1978:110)
Jefferson and Grimshaw show how the police control of the mass picket reflected the relative influence of several ‘audiences’:
On this occasion…the police saw their legal-democratic duty quite clearly: in their terms, it was to maintain the rights of all parties to the dispute — those of Grunwick's boss to continue production with his remaining labour force, of pedestrians and road-users to ‘perambulate freely’, of the pickets to peacefully make their protest, and of the community as a whole to be protected from scenes of public disorder.
Their occupational duty, as they saw it, was equally clear-sufficient numbers and mobile reserves for the trouble spots.
But given the lengthiness of the dispute, the demands of other policework, and the regularity of ‘trouble’, the ‘permanent’ mobile reserve, the SPG, became a routine feature of the policing of Grunwick, and especially the confrontational aspects.
(Jefferson and Grimshaw, 1984:108)
The media projected a view that the pickets were primarily responsible for the violence at Grunwick, adding to the clamour to curb mass picketing.
The so-called Winter of Discontent (1978–9) generated even more anti-trade-union sentiment, especially as Labour's attempt to establish a 5 per cent pay norm led to strikes by lorry drivers and the low paid and produced television scenes of ‘mountains’ of uncollected refuse (Scraton, 1985b).
Partly as a consequence, the Tories were returned to power under Margaret Thatcher in 1979.
Their first real test by the unions was the 12-week national steel strike, commencing January 1980.
Mass picketing was focused on the Hadfields private steel works in Sheffield.
Regarded as a routine industrial dispute, without sinister political connotations (Kahn et al., 1983), the picketing was seldom violent, very much conforming to Geary's push-and-shove model.
Moreover, the policing of the picket line was organised and controlled by local police officers according to a ‘hearts and minds’ philosophy: the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire sensibly recognised that almost every family in Sheffield had connections with the steelworkers and was keen to ensure that the police did not alienate themselves from the wider community.
The police therefore adopted a highly discretionary approach, often choosing to overlook technical infringements in the interest of public order.
Such tactics pre-empted violent  resistance even when occasional arrests had to be made (Waddington et al., 1989:76–7).
During a 4-week lull in activity outside Hadfields, there was a mass picket on 22 February on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent.
Events at this picket were to shape the character of the next major mass picket of Hadfields on 12 March.
The pickets travelling to Kent were met by unbridled hostility from local people, orchestrated by local newspapers.
Handbills appeared, depicting Lord Kitchener admonishing local people, ‘Your Island Needs You!’ and signs in shop windows declared: ‘No pickets served’(Docherty, 1983:198).
Pickets' coaches were stopped en route and searched by the police.
On the picket line itself, the conduct of Metropolitan police officers prompted accusations of brutality (ibid.:199).
This was a different experience of picketing.
Support for the strike was also waning.
Pickets turned up at Hadfields on 12 March seeking a confrontation.
The police anticipated trouble and had drafted in reinforcements from neighbouring forces.
Pickets charged them and there was hand-to-hand fighting.
Clearly all basis of accommodation had collapsed and seventy-five arrests were made.
Hadfields was largely peaceful but attitudes had hardened on both sides.
The mass picket helped justify such subsequent developments as more mobile squads of police, greater mutual aid between forces and the introduction of the Employment Act 1980 which outlawed secondary picketing and allowed the police to determine the maximum size of the picket.
The 1980–1 riots also suggested a need for improvements in police training and equipment, which were first evident in the Warrington Messenger dispute of 1983.
Ostensibly a dispute concerning the protection of a closed-shop arrangement and an attempt to resist the introduction of new technology, it is clear that the strike was symptomatic of Eddie Shah's (the newspaper proprietor's) intention to strike a blow against trade-union power.
Government ministers portrayed him ‘not only as a champion of the law but a defender of the rights of workers not to unionise’(Scraton, 1985b:158).
In anticipation of two large mass pickets on 29 and 30 of November, designed to block the distribution of the newspaper, the Home Secretary is said to have personally intervened to make sure that the police had sufficient personnel to guarantee normal distribution (Gennard, 1984:16).
Specialist police squads were brought in from outside constabularies, and their containment tactics included the deployment of ‘snatch squads’ and the indiscriminate batoning of pickets (Scraton, 1985b:158).
Hain (1986:131) is convinced that: ‘The police, publicly urged on by the Prime  Minister and Home Secretary, were determined to break the strike by preventing the mass picketing.’
The speed of the Home Secretary's intervention and the rapid deployment of riot-trained officers between forces ‘announced the arrival of a national police response to ‘civil disorder’ ' (Scraton, 1985a:149).
This was to be seen with more telling effect in the coal dispute which started some 6 months later.
The immediate context
The immediate political context was framed by the central issue of the strike itself: the National Union of Mineworkers' (NUM's) opposition to pit closures and their implications for the loss of jobs and the demise of mining communities.
The trigger for the strike was the closure of the Cortonwood mine in South Yorkshire.
The NUM responded with an ‘area by area’ strategy, obviating the need for a national ballot.
When moderate areas, principally Nottinghamshire, failed to comply, Yorkshire miners tried to bring them into line by picketing their pits.
The year-long strike eventually resulted in defeat for the NUM, due, not least, to the police success in enabling working miners to continue to enter pits and strikebreakers to return to work.
Police tactics deployed during the strike included roadblocks designed to prevent miners from reaching picket lines.
On one occasion, ‘action likely to cause a breach of the peace’ was invoked by Kent police successfully to turn miners back at the Dartford tunnel, over 100 miles from their intended destination.
On the picket lines themselves, the police made uncompromising use of the discretion available to them under public-order law.
Minor offences, e.g. stepping off a pavement or shouting ‘scab’ activities generally tolerated in industrial disputes — were sometimes used as the pretext for an arrest.
In addition, long-forgotten statutes, e.g. ‘watching and besetting’, were conveniently resurrected; bail conditions were used to deter picketing; and there were widespread allegations of the use of covert surveillance and police agents provocateurs .
The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) claimed that the NRC was merely a convenient device for guaranteeing effective mutual aid for overstretched forces.
An alternative view was expressed that the NRC were under the direct influence of the Home Office, thus undermining any form of independence previously enjoyed by Chief Constables (Scraton, 1985a).
The notion of police audiences provides a useful basis on which to explain why this policy was adopted.
Taking the influence of occupational audiences first, it is reasonable to assume that rank-and-file preference  would be to avoid ‘another Saltley’.
Senior ACPO members, notably its president Charles McLachlan, the Chief Constable of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary, also prioritised the right to work over the right to picket.
Therefore, there was strong pressure on chief constables to adopt a hard-line approach from within their own institution.
The legal influences on police policy were formidable.
The Home Secretary wrote to and held regular briefing sessions with Chief Constables, leaving them in no doubt as to what he expected of them (Uglow, 1988).
Once the police roadblock strategy had been implemented, it received the immediate endorsement of the Attorney General, whilst their hard-line approach to picket-line misconduct was sanctioned by severe court sentencing of offenders.
Democratic audiences had to consent to this approach.
A virulent ideological onslaught was waged against the miners by an unsympathetic media and a large cross-section of politicians.
For the whole of its duration, the strike, which was instigated without a ballot, was condemned as illegitimate and unconstitutional.
The NUM's leaders were branded as subversive and the ‘right to work’ held as absolute.
Violent conduct by miners was condemned; that by police justified as defensive or reactive.
Any opponents of the policing strategy (e.g. pro-NUM police committees) were dismissed as partisan.
The creation of an ideological climate conducive to the harshest possible policing of the strike culminated in the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher's, ‘enemy within' speech, which equated the pickets with IRA terrorism and ‘subversive’ local governments (Scraton, 1985a).
The net result was a political atmosphere ‘in which it became impossible for the police as a whole to avoid a distortion of priorities and for individual police officers it became more and more difficult to disentangle fact from prejudice in assessing those whom they were sent to police’(McCabe and Wallington, 1988:134–5).
PUBLIC DISORDER DURING THE COAL DISPUTE: THE ‘BATTLE OF ORGREAVE’
We are now in a position to examine the implications of the prevailing ideological climate for the policing of public-order situations during the coal dispute.
This process is achieved by looking at our principal case study, the Battle of Orgreave.
The mass picketing of Orgreave — a tactic used to discourage the British Steel Corporation (BSC) from increasing its daily supplies of coke to its Scunthorpe steel works above a quota already agreed with the miners’ and steel workers' unions — was initially characterised by good-humoured pushing and shoving on both sides.
The first major flashpoint occurred when Arthur Scargill entered the premises on Sunday 27 May, to invoke the solidarity of steel union officials.
When he re-emerged, a crowd gathered round him.
The police chose this moment to charge at and disperse the pickets from the entrance to the plant and the NUM President was bundled to the floor.
Outraged by the police action, Scargill appeared on news bulletins later that day, calling for reinforcements to turn up and emulate the closure of Saltley.
There was no delivery of coke on the following day but, on Tuesday 29 May, thousands of pickets plus police from eleven forces descended on the plant.
From the outset, the police demonstrated a consistently uncompromising attitude.
One crowd of pickets was prevented from getting within half a mile of the gates by lines of police officers, while a second group, who had managed to assemble earlier opposite the gates, was charged by police horses and dog handlers.
When the convoys of coke lorries arrived, any attempt at picketing was rendered ineffectual: whenever serious pushing was exerted against police lines, snatch squads were instantly deployed.
Sensing the futility of their actions, some miners threw stones.
This was answered by the production of full-length riot shields and, as the throwing intensified, mounted horses with baton-wielding riders were sent in.
On the following day, Arthur Scargill was arrested for obstructing the highway.
Up until then, the number of pickets present had been small.
Predictably, however, Scargill's arrest brought scores more miners into the area.
Disorder escalated as on the previous day.
From 7 to 17 June, the NUM kept only a token picket on Orgreave.
However, on 18 June, a secretly organised mass picket caught the police momentarily off guard.
Scores of pickets brushed past the greatly reduced police presence to enter the coking plant, which had to be cleared by police.
Later, on the picket line, there was a minor confrontation accompanying the arrival of morning convoy during which a police riot shield was captured and symbolically set alight.
No further hostilities occurred until the late afternoon.
Then, a group of youths rolled a tractor tyre towards the police line.
Some officers broke ranks and were met with a volley of stones.
At this point, police on horseback and riot officers carrying riot shields chased pickets across fields and railway lines into the village and through gardens.
When the police regrouped with the intention of holding a railway bridge, pickets constructed blazing barricades out of the remnants of scrapped cars, telegraph poles and a portakabin to prevent a second advance.
The relevant explanatory variables are listed in Table 5.1.
The patent absence of police-picket accommodation at all times may be partially explained in terms of a communication context characterised by a steady   accumulation of negative encounters between the police and NUM, a complete lack of liaison between South Yorkshire police and the organisers of the mass picket, frequent resort to tactics of surprise and NUM leaders steadfastly resisting media pressure to disavow picket-line violence involving their own rank and file.
Key situational factors were also important.
Prominent amongst these were a rapid turnover of police and strikers, leaving them little time for situational adjustment, and a corresponding lack of discipline, organisation and effective command structure on both sides.
The miners and the police share occupational cultures in which solidarity and toughness were highly valued.
Each side was therefore unwilling to give ground and ready to support or go to the aid of their colleagues.
At the interactional level, the immediate precipitants of the conflict were a succession of undisciplined, uncompromising actions.
However, it would be misleading to divorce such activities from the prevailing structural relationship between the state and NUM, and the political context of the strike:
Orgreave was not seen as a local picket during an industrial dispute but a trial of strength in a politically charged struggle.
The way it was policed and who policed it was similarly defined by national rather than local considerations.
The conflict between the South Yorkshire police and the area NUM had been transformed into a confrontation between the state and the ‘enemy within’.
(Waddington et al., 1989:92)
STRIKE VIOLENCE IN AMERICA, 1870–1984
A general overview
It is common for serious disorder associated with British trade disputes to be referred to as ‘American-style violence’.
This is not without good reason.
Taft and Ross (1969:221) point out that ‘The United States has had the bloodiest and most violent labor history of any industrial nation in the world.’
According to their analysis of American industrial confrontations from the 1870s to the 1960s, violence has been most severe on those occasions when employers have tried to ‘break’ existing unions, or deny recognition to newly forming ones.
With few exceptions, labor violence was the result of isolated and usually unplanned acts on a picket line, or occurred on a prohibited parade or demonstration protesting employer obduracy or police brutality.
It might also start by attempts to prevent the transportation of strikebreakers or goods, and a clash would follow police intervention.
Where the employer refused to deal with the union, the possibility of eventual violence was always high.
The desire of the American worker for union representation took place in the teeth of employer opposition that was able to impose heavy sanctions for union activity.
(Taft and Ross, 1969:291–2)
As with the changing character of British industrial conflict, American ‘labor violence’ has undergone a series of transitions since the late-nineteenth century.
Between 1873 and 1878, for example, the hesitant growth of American trade unionism was dramatically set back by a 5-year economic depression.
During this time, trade-union membership declined by five-sixths to 50,000.
The employers saw this as an opportunity to ensure the complete destruction of trade unionism and, between 1877 and 1922, set out to achieve this aim.
Acting both singly and through employer associations, they engaged in frequent lockouts, hired spies to ferret out union sympathizers, circulated the names of such sympathizers to fellow employers through so-called black-lists, summarily discharged labor ‘agitators’, and engaged the services of strikebreakers on a widespread scale.
(Sloane and Witney, 1985:62)
Griffin et al.(1986:148) emphasise how the employers' tactics varied in their subtlety.
Sometimes they resorted to ‘divide and conquer’ strategies (e.g. hiring immigrant labour to undercut white wages), they deskilled workers to reduce their craft monopoly, used sympathetic newspapers and journals to disseminate anti-union propaganda and successfully lobbied politicians.
Some 200,000 agents provocateurs were used in 1928 alone, and the militia was called in to break strikes on 500 occasions between 1875 and 1910.
Despite the controversy it often provoked, military intervention in labor conflicts was common from 1875 to 1925.
Military forces, usually state militia, were frequently called upon during that period to preserve law and order in violent strike situations.
In theory the militia's role was to keep peace, but in fact the military often used force, sometimes wantonly, to break strikes.
During the great railroad strike of 1877, for example, 45,000 militiamen were called up in eleven states and more than 100 strikers were killed and several hundred were wounded.
In fact, between 1877 and 1892, at least 30 percent of the militia's active duty assignments involved strikes.
(Jacobs, 1982:163–4)
This situation was due to an imbalance in the law which permitted employers to reject union recognition and employ strikebreakers (Taft and Ross, 1969:230).
The 1890s and early 1900s saw a series of bitter conflicts associated with drives for union recognition.
Between 1902 and 1904, some 200 people were killed and over 2,000 injured as a result of industrial conflict (Thieblot and Haggard, 1983:15).
This was perhaps the most  violent 2-year period in American industrial-relations history.
However, the most infamous of all confrontations occurred in 1914, the year of the ‘Ludlow Massacre’, when thirty-five militia opened fire on a tent colony of 8,000–10,000 members of mining families recently evicted from their homes during a union-recognition strike.
Three men and a boy were shot dead and, when tents were set ablaze, two women and eleven children who had hidden in an underground cellar, were suffocated by smoke.
Later, three prisoners, including a strike leader, were shot dead ‘while attempting to escape’.
Outraged by this action, the miners, supported by the Colorado labour movement, took up arms and raided local mines.
After 10 days of gun battles, Federal troops were called out to quell the violence.
Including the twenty-one killed at Ludlow, the episode accounted for over fifty deaths.
The union was unsuccessful in gaining recognition: ‘The Ludlow war, one of the more tragic episodes in labor's history, failed to dissolve the adamantine opposition to unionism, which had become a fixed and immovable article of faith among many of the great industries of the United States’(Taft and Ross, 1969:256).
The war years (1914–18) were marked by attitudes of mutual restraint and government intervention on behalf of the military effort.
These attitudes were soon lifted as peacetime dawned.
There were protracted coal disputes (1919–21) as the United Mineworkers of America (UMW) sought to organise non-union counties in West Virginia.
In May 1920, there was a gun battle between miners and company guards in Mingo County, caused by the eviction of workers from company houses.
Ten people were shot dead (seven of them guards).
In the post-war depression years of 1923–32 there was a 25 per cent loss of union membership and a corresponding decline in industrial violence.
The presidential election of Franklin Roosevelt in November 1932 coincided with the promise of a New Deal for the American working class.
This was the stimulus for a new wave of conflict primarily concerned with union recognition and the right to belong to a union.
Between 1933 and 1937, a body of sympathetic legislation was enacted, notably, the National Industrial Recovery Act 1933 and the National Labor Relations Act 1935, giving trade unions the right to organise and bargain collectively, and compelling employers to bargain in good faith.
The latter piece of legislation, the so-called Wagner Act, further established penalties for employers seeking to prevent unions from organising freely and set up a new federal agency, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to ensure its provisions were enforced (Wallace et al., 1988).
None the less, the employers were intent on fierce resistance.
Half of  the 4,650 strikes in 1937 (involving two million workers) were over union recognition.
The newly formed NLRB was successful in spotlighting a variety of anti-union methods encouraged by well-known corporations.
These were the years of the infamous ‘American Plan’, which advocated the use of blacklists, spies, injunctions and propaganda, and the ‘Mohawk Valley Formula’ which urged employers to use the police to break up meetings and organise vigilante groups to protect strikebreakers (Fox Piven and Cloward, 1977:120).
The work of the NLRB and the publicity generated by civil liberties groups helped to turn the tide against industrial violence:
By 1940, the period of violence was over and unionism had won acceptance.
There were several reasons: most immediate, perhaps, was the need for uninterrupted production as war orders from Europe mounted; secondly, the large size of the corporations and the new degree of union strength made it difficult to recruit the many thousands of strikebreakers for full-scale industrial warfare; third, government pressures put the corporations on the defensive; and finally, the entry of the United States into the war created a need for national unity.
(Bell, 1954:246)
High inflation in 1946 heralded a strike wave of unprecedented proportions: over 4.5 million workers went on strike and more working days were lost than at any time since 1927 (Wallace et al., 1988:8).
This was the backdrop to a rising tide of anti-trade-union sentiment and pressure by the media and employers culminating in the passing of the Labor-Management Relations Act 1947 (the Taft-Hartley Act), which purported to recreate a more equitable balance of power between unions and management by prohibiting certain unfair practices by the former and providing specific rules for handling large strike which, in the president's view, constituted national emergencies.
Section 8(b) (1)(A) of the 1947 Act gave the National Labor Relations Board the necessary power to proceed against union tactics involving ‘violence, intimidation and reprisal or threats’.
The Board's overriding concern was to deprive employees found guilty of such acts of their reinstatement rights.
The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act 1959 (the Landrum-Griffin Act) imposed added restrictions on picketing, strikes and boycotts and limited the union leaders' control over union funds and other administrative matters.
According to Taft and Ross, the object of this legislation was the ‘substitution of orderly procedures for trials of combat’(Taft and Ross, 1969:287).
The cumulative effect of successive legislative acts has been,
on the one hand to provide a platform for asserting labor's right to contend on an equal footing with capital but, on the other hand, to limit the very capacity to engage in militant confrontation.
The price of legitimate access to the political arena is tactical moderation.
(Wallace et al., 1988:23)
Many American academics now look upon strike violence as an occasional, rather than endemic, feature of American industry (Rubenstein, 1989:322).
This view is not shared by Thieblot and Haggard.
They maintain that,
Far from being an interesting but irrelevant aspect of collective labor relations, such violence and bloodshed continue to the present day.
In many industries, a strike in 1984 is almost as likely to result in fatalities, injuries, or destruction of property as it would have been in 1934 or even 1904.
(Thieblot and Haggard, 1983:3)
Their study, based on newspaper accounts across the 6-year period, 1975–81, refers to 2,598 incidents of violence; 49 deaths; 2,732 instances of damage to vehicles (including tyre damage); the use of 20 tons of TNT explosive; 182 attacks on buildings or property; and finally, 133 cases where homes were shot at, firebombed or vandalised.
Obviously, these authors are including the threat or application of violence by, or against individuals, whereas this book refers to collective confrontations of a distinctively public nature.
Nevertheless, several of their assertions provide useful talking points.
According to their data, the United Mineworkers of America is the ‘most violent’ of the larger American trade unions, with 7.36 incidents per 10,000 members during the period studied, compared with an average of 1.2 for twenty major unions with memberships of over 100,000.
The authors also devote a chapter to describing the UMW's violent conduct during strikes in 1977 and 1981.
Given its comparative relevance to the British coal dispute, it is essential that we examine this conduct in more detail.
Strike violence involving the UMW
In order to understand the UMW's tactics, one must first realise that the coal industry has a centralised bargaining structure.
Since 1950, contracts have been negotiated at 3-yearly intervals between the Bituminous Coal Operators Association (BCOA) and the UMW.
There has been a ritualised tendency, in the event of a failure to agree a contract, for union mines to  close until settlement is achieved.
Non-union mines are then persuaded by pickets to close down (technically illegally) to improve the strike's effectiveness.
Every negotiation from 1968 to 1981 resulted in strikes (Navarro, 1983:214).
The sticking point in the national strike of 1977 was the union's right to stage wildcat strikes between contracts, which had reached a very high level in 1975 and 1976.
The strike started in December 1977.
It was called under very unfavourable conditions for the UMW.
There was a low US energy dependence on coal (only 18–20 per cent); several months' stockpiles of coal were held by key consumers; UMW-dominated mines held a low share of the total number of national contracts (around 52 per cent , compared with 67 per cent in 1974); there was a growing influence on the markets of western strip mines (which tended to be non-union organised by the International Union of Operating Engineers) who would not be sympathetic; and finally, the petroleum crisis of the early 1970s had prompted the re-opening of many smaller mines (6,100 operating units in 1969 to 7,000 in 1977) which were non-union.
Thus,
To win the strike on their terms, the unionists would have to shut down not only the union mines, but also the non-union ones — at least in the East where the manpower was available to do it.
But their efforts were likely to be resisted by an increasingly strong non-union segment.
(Thieblot and Haggard, 1983:99–100)
The UMW's primary targets of attention were some 1,800 non-union mines and a host of independent transportation companies.
Within 2 days of the start, an explosion had wrecked a drilling machine at a small non-union mine.
By the time the Taft-Hartley Act was invoked ninety-five days later, there would be a total of two killings, two assaults, thirty-five bombings, the taking of one hostage, and seventy-one other ‘disruptions’ involving such things as sabotage of railroads, gunfire directed against people, trains, and motor vehicles, property damage, and other incidents of violence serious enough to be noted by the Department of Justice.
(Thieblot and Haggard, 1983:101)
In 1981, the union's position was even weaker: UMW mines accounted for only 44 per cent of national coal production; again, there were large stockpiles of coal; and generally, there was a more conservative, anti-union climate:
The political winds had also been blowing from a different and more  conservative direction.
In the event of trouble, many of the non-union operators now would have easier access — in some cases for the first time — to the political system and its protective police arm.
(Thieblot and Haggard, 1983:112)
In Virginia, for example, large patrols of state police were deployed, restraining collective violence, but encouraging cat-and-mouse tactics by the UMW, whereby
Groups of strikers assembled and disbanded, led their trooper escorts on pointless all-night drives in caravans, painted broom handles to resemble gun barrels and pointed them out of windows, and generally tried to confuse the authorities with multiple feints and parries.
(Thieblot and Haggard, 1983:117)
Thieblot and Haggard do not provide a systematic analysis of the reasons for the supposedly violence-prone nature of the UMW, or indeed, for the differing characteristics of the 1977 and 1981 disputes.
They present a general argument which sees violence as resulting from a widespread reluctance by the legal authorities to invoke potentially effective legislation, and tacitly to endorse such misbehaviour by passing it off as ‘picket-line horseplay’ or exuberance.
Nevertheless, these authors do list those characteristics of the ‘strike setting’ which they consider most conducive to violence (Thieblot and Haggard, 1983:10–11).
Thus the probability of violence is high where: the industry is fragmented into a large number of firms; workers of the strike-hit firm are well-paid, but easily replaced (notably under conditions of high unemployment); union leaders condone the use of violence; the strike issues relate to matters of ‘union security’ rather than pay; and institutions like the police and media implicitly condone violence.
Thieblot and Haggard emphasise that these observations are made only on the basis of ‘preliminary analysis’ and do not offer any empirical validation.
Notably absent from this taxonomy is any reference to the socio-political context — somewhat of a surprise given their reference to the changing direction of the ‘political winds’ in the 1981 coal strike.
This variable, and others approximating to those listed by Thieblot and Haggard, are included in a recently formulated model by Canadian researchers.
Certain of the variables included in this model augment the flashpoints approach to industrial confrontation.
It is therefore essential that we study it in close detail.
A CANADIAN MODEL OF STRIKE VIOLENCE
Using official strike dab from Ontario for the period 1958–1967, Grant and Wallace (1991) conclude that strike violence is a function of the following variables:(i) the legislative environment,(ii) the sociopolitical context,(iii) the distribution of skills among the workforce (and its corresponding degree of participation in the strike), and (iv) the strategies employed by the strikers and their employers.
Referring to variations in the legislative environment, Grant and Wallace explain that, under the Canadian industrial relations system, strike may only legally occur after a compulsory waiting period has expired and a conciliation board has met to discuss the difference between workers and employers.
According to Grant and Wallace, this technicality helps determine whether strikes turn violent.
There tends to be more division between workers where the strike may be defined as ‘illegal’; employers are likewise more apt to continue production and employ strikebreakers; and trade unions are more likely to elicit more public condemnation and encounter ‘more vigorous state repression’ when they deliberately flout the law (ibid.:1125).
In emphasising the significance of the ‘socio-political context’, Grant and Wallace point out that the existence of a pro-labour climate is likely to encourage high levels of violence.
This is because a ‘friendly’ government is less likely to suppress violent conduct by its voters.
Alternatively, violence is likely to decline during election years, when trade unionists are careful to protect ‘their’ party's image.
High unemployment is singled out as a second, key socio-political variable: depressed labour markets mean that replacement workers are available, and this could lead to confrontations as they try to cross picket lines.
The issues over which strikes are fought also fall into the category of relevant political variables.
Strikes over ideological issues (e.g. union recognition and conditions of work) are liable to be more violent than bread-and-butter issues like wages and hours of work.
The latter tend to be less emotive and are more amenable to compromise.
The ‘skill mix’ of the workforce may have a bearing on the conduct of the strike, since skilled workers tend to have a more harmonious relationship with the employer, and their relatively favoured position in the labour market usually enables them to achieve their demands without having to resort to violence.
By contrast, semi-skilled and unskilled workers may have to employ more militant (i.e. potentially violent) tactics.
Since they are more easily replaced, the employer is more likely to use strikebreakers against them.
Differences of value-orientation may be manifested in  contrasting levels of commitment and readiness to cross picket lines.
The prospect of violence is greatest where there is a roughly equal division of support for and against the strike.
Finally, the strike strategies adopted by employers and workers will influence whether or not violence occurs.
An employer's determination to maintain plant operations (possibly via the use of strikebreakers) and stare down the opposition through a protracted strike carries a high risk of violence.
While the mobilisation of large numbers of pickets may be advantageous to the union's cause, it also invites problems of disorganisation and indiscipline.
DISCUSSION
The studies of Thieblot and Haggard, and Grant and Wallace provide a useful checklist of those features of a ‘strike setting’ which make it particularly conducive to disorder.
This checklist encompasses a range of relevant variables, such as the influence of particular forms of legislation, the condition of the economy, the principal features of the industry, its product and employees, and the central issues of the strike itself.
Such variables are too specific to industrial relations to be included in the flashpoints model of public disorder.
As such, they help to complement and enhance our understanding of strike violence; though, as the Orgreave case study demonstrates, the flashpoints model provides an adequate general basis for analysing picket-line disorder.
Certain key variables highlighted by Grant and Wallace correspond to those factors considered especially crucial by the flashpoints model.
For example, each model sees the amount of legitimacy conferred upon a dispute as influencing the way it is handled by the police; and there is similar agreement that deep-seated ‘ideological issues’ are more commonly associated with disorder than more mundane ‘material issues’.
There is more room for disagreement with Grant and Wallace's assertion that a pro-labour climate is most conducive to strike violence, principally because workers may feel that such behaviour will be tolerated under a supportive regime.
The British experience of the past two decades suggests a positive correlation between the anti-union sentiments and activities of government and picket-line disorder.
There may be a methodological basis for this disagreement.
Grant and Wallace establish the relationship between strike violence and pro-labour climates on the oversimplified basis of a correlation between the incidence and severity of disorder and the percentage of Liberal seats in the Canadian parliament.
As the all-party condemnation of mass picketing in Britain in the 1980s  demonstrated, few politicians will express public support for militant trade-union tactics, and even those supporters of the labour movement may be reserved or critical in their attitudes.
Taken together, the historical and contemporary British and American examples reviewed above suggest that the way trade unions are perceived by society and responded to by the state are key factors in the genesis of industrial confrontation.
Picket-line relations have been most tranquil in those periods of British and American history characterised by ‘consensus politics’— where trade unions have been accepted into the polity (the government and those who are able to influence its policies) as legitimate ‘members’, rather than excluded as ‘challengers’(cf. Ragin et al., 1982:241).
By contrast, collective violence has been most prevalent and virulent during historical periods when trade unionism has been stigmatised as threatening or inimical to the interests and well-being of society.
Under such circumstances, permissive legal structures have enabled governments or private employers to resort to strike-breaking tactics involving the police or military to prevent or undermine trade union organisation.
Thus violence was sustained at a high level by American capitals ‘first great offensive against labor’ from the late-nineteenth century to the 1920s.
In Britain, conflict was most severe prior to the First World War, when the power to call out the police and troops lay in the hands of local employer/magistrate, and occasions like the General Strike of 1926 when fears of a worker revolution were aroused.
Since the mid-1960s, the post-war consensus politics of British society have virtually been abandoned: trade unions can no longer presume to have a partnership role and have increasingly been perceived as problematic to the national interest.
The primacy of the individual's ‘right to work’ has been upheld as sacrosanct, to be defended at all cost against the ‘tyranny of the mass picket’.
Such was the message which right-wing politicians and the British press delivered to the police from 1983 and beyond.
The ‘space’ which once existed for police and pickets to negotiate a mutually acceptable code of picket-line conduct has been closed off, as the miners and striking print workers discovered to their cost.
The British coal dispute of 1984–5 had more in common with the American ‘labor struggles’ of the early twentieth century than the post-reform era UMW strikes of 1977 and 1981.
Force, not compromise, was the key political watchword, and disorder the inevitable result.
Football hooliganism
THE HEYSEL TRAGEDY
The summer of 1985 was described by one prominent football historian as ‘the lowest ebb in the fortunes of British football’(Walvin, 1986:6).
Two major disasters, costing ninety-four lives, provoked an unprecedented public outcry and led to a series of punitive measures against British clubs and their supporters.
First there was the Bradford City fire.
This occurred at an end-of-season game where a large crowd was gathered to celebrate the team's promotion to the second division.
Fire broke out in an old, litter-strewn stand which soon became a death trap in which fifty-six people perished.
Within a few weeks of this tragedy, on 29 May 1985, further disaster struck at the European Cup Final between Italy's Juventus and England's Liverpool at Brussels' Heysel Stadium.
This happened when Juventus fans were chased out of an enclosure dominated by English supporters and, in the ensuing panic and rush to escape, a stadium wall collapsed, producing an appalling crush of bodies in which thirty-eight people (mostly Italian) died and 400 more were injured.
The resulting Committee of Inquiry (Popplewell, 1986), highlighted the problematic nature of crowd-control arrangements for the final (notably the failure to ensure the effective segregation of rival supporters and the inadequate numbers of gendarmerie), and weaknesses in the physical structure of the stadium.
The Committee refuted suggestions that the British National Front had deliberately provoked the disorder, but indicated that large numbers of spectators had consumed too much alcohol.
They emphasised as their ‘final and most important lesson…that if hooligans did not behave like hooligans at football matches there would be no such risk of injury’(ibid.:8).
Following massive international condemnation, an indefinite ban was imposed on all English clubs playing in Europe.
As Walvin (1986:9) explains, ‘The country which had developed and then exported the game found itself ostracised and reviled in the world's footballing fraternity.’
The Heysel tragedy was but the latest incident in a catalogue of infamy which had dogged the British game, both home and abroad, for as long as people could remember (ibid.).
In April 1989, hundreds of Liverpool fans were crushed to death on the terraces of Sheffield's Hillsborough Stadium before the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
There was initial speculation that hooligan behaviour had contributed to the disaster, but an official inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor (Taylor, 1989) blamed police crowd-management tactics.
The Hillsborough disaster seemed to encourage a period of self-reflection and greater public sympathy for the beleaguered game of soccer.
The ban on British clubs was lifted (except for Liverpool).
There were hopeful indications of a possible decline in hooliganism both inside and outside the ground.
However, ‘riots’ before and after the Leeds United match at Bournemouth in May 1990, which resulted in 120 arrests, suggested that football hooliganism had far from disappeared and that there was still no basis for complacency.
This chapter describes and analyses soccer spectator violence, both domestically and when British teams play abroad.
The chapter begins by characterising the different forms of football hooliganism, and makes broad generalisations about the type of people who are most commonly involved.
Preliminary insights are then developed by studying explanations of disorder (or the lack of it) at American soccer and baseball matches, and of sports riots in general.
Particular emphasis is placed at this point on the distinction between issue-oriented and issueless riots, the latter tending to occur in the absence of any justificatory rationale (Marx, 1972).
This distinction provides a useful basis for a review and evaluation of specific theoretical approaches to football hooliganism.
THE NATURE OF FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM
Before discussing possible explanations of football hooliganism, it is necessary to clarify the different forms of behaviour incorporated within this term, where these activities typically occur, and what kinds of people most commonly engage in them.
According to Melnick (1986:1–2), ‘The forms of misbehaviour commonly associated with football hooliganism include physical assaults on opposing fans and police, pitch invasions, throwing missiles, verbal abuse, vandalism, drunkenness, theft and possession of an offensive weapon.’
Such activities can vary in severity.
For example, ‘assaults on opposing fans’ could refer to a fist fight between two rival supporters or a massive chase involving hundreds of people.
Similarly, ‘throwing missiles’ embraces a number of possible behaviours ranging from the hurling of an orange to the lobbing of petrol bombs (Dunning et al., 1986).
The nature and prevalence of soccer spectator disorder has undergone a number of historical transformations.
The incidence of crowd misbehaviour reached a high point before the First World War, fell between the two World Wars, and continued to fall until the late-1950s, since when it continued to increase quite rapidly (Dunning et al., 1982; 1984).
Most contemporary forms of disorder have been evident since the inception of professional soccer in the 1870s.
‘However, the balance between the different forms has tended to vary.
More particularly, attacks on players and match officials were predominant before the First World War, whilst fights between opposing fan groups are predominant today’(Dunning, 1990:76).
There is clear evidence that both the pervasiveness and seriousness of soccer violence have been exaggerated: ‘The plain fact is, the great majority of spectators who attend football matches are unlikely to ever witness an instance of personal assault let alone be the victim of one’(Melnick, 1986:9).
This is chiefly because the hard-core hooligan element attached to one soccer club is only likely to be interested in a confrontation with the opposition's elite hooligan crew.
It is misleading to imagine that soccer violence most frequently occurs inside the football ground.
This may once have been the case.
As recently as the 1970s, for example, great kudos was attached to ‘infiltrating’ the section of end terracing behind the goals where opposing fans were gathered.
However, this tactic has been abandoned due to improved police surveillance and the greater likelihood of being caught.
Consequently, football hooliganism is more likely to occur wherever rival fans meet — i.e. in shopping centres, public houses, inside railway stations, on roads and rail, and motorway service stations (Dunning et al., 1986).
The hooligan fans are mostly white, working-class males aged 17–20.
(Though there are substantial deviations from this profile which we shall refer to below.)
Often, the groups of fans most dedicated to hooligan behaviour are organised into hard-core ‘fighting crews’(e.g. the Leeds United ‘Service Crew’, Manchester United's ‘Red Devils’, West Ham's ‘Inter City Crew’, Chelsea's ‘Anti-Personnel Firm’, Arsenal's ‘Gooners’, Millwall's ‘Bushwackers’, Tottenham's ‘The Spurs Yids’ and, in Scotland, Aberdeen's ‘Soccer Casuals’).
Several studies emphasise that, far from being marginally interested in  the game, hooligan supporters tend to be among the most committed and knowledgeable of fans (Dunning et al., 1986).
It is equally undeniable that they derive great pleasure from physical confrontations with rival groups of supporters and go to great lengths to evade the authorities and make such confrontations possible.
Such fans tend not to travel on the regular ‘soccer special’ bus coaches and trains, preferring to use scheduled public transport.
Contrary to the popular stereotype, they take care to dress smartly, according to current youth fashions.
Each of these devices improves the chances of escaping police surveillance (cf.
Observer , 2 June 1985).
Other popular myths also fail to withstand close scrutiny.
While there is no doubt that fascist organisations like the National Front have attempted to recruit members from the ranks of football hooligans, there is little to connect them with violence in the game (Popplewell, 1986:59).
Dunning and co-workers (1986) further point out that there is little proof that soccer violence is caused by the excessive drinking of alcohol: many hooligans seldom drink prior to the match to keep a ‘clear head’ for any aggression which might take place.
Common sense also suggests that there are many people who drink before attending sporting contests but do not become involved in fighting.
While violence on the field of play may generate tension and even trigger violence, one must probe a little deeper to discover the underlying social roots of the problem.
AMERICAN SPECTATOR VIOLENCE
It is possible that some basis for explaining British football hooliganism may be found in appropriate studies of American sports-related disorder.
Though violence sometimes occurs at American sporting contests, it is seldom of a comparable scale and intensity to the football hooliganism which so often takes place in Britain, West Germany, the Netherlands and Latin America (Guttmann, 1986; Smith, 1983).
Lewis (1982) calculates that there were 312 sports-related ‘riots’ in the USA between 1962 and 1970.
The seriousness of these riots varied in range, from object throwing and fist fights involving a handful of fans, to pitch invasions and damage to property involving several hundred participants.
Nevertheless, the figures indicate that 97 (31 per cent) of the riots occurred at baseball matches and 66 (21 per cent ) at American football games, with basketball (17 per cent ) and hockey (12.5 per cent ) recording the next highest frequencies.
Overall, the figures offer qualified support for Guttmann's assertion that spectator violence is class-related (1986:164).
In contrast to the British game, American soccer is watched by a more middle-class audience of both  sexes, and is practically devoid of violence.
Against this, the largely ‘blue-collar’ sport of baseball is often affected by crowd disorder.
It is worth pausing to look at the degree of crowd disorder associated with these sports and the possible reasons for such profiles.
British and American soccer violence compared
Football spectator violence is virtually absent from American society.
The contrast with the British situation seems largely explicable in terms of the differing degrees of fan involvement in the sport, the class and gender composition of the crowd and the way the sport is packaged and approached as a form of entertainment.
Roadburg (1980) provides a checklist of the key historical, ecological and social factors distinguishing British soccer as a spectator sport from its American counterpart.
One important distinction is that British soccer fans tend to have a much greater sense of commitment to, and identification with, both the game itself and their favoured soccer team than American soccer spectators.
As Roadburg points out, ‘the average British soccer fan is more able than his (sic) North American counterpart to identify with the game as a product of his heritage and culture’(Roadburg, 1980:269).
There is a partisanship and collective involvement, heightened by the segregation of opposing fans (most notably behind each goal) which is absent from the American game.
In the USA, loyalty is more likely to be spread across a variety of different sports and support for any one team is liable to be tenuous.
Away supporters are seldom, if ever, present and the crowd has less solidarity: the match-day involvement is more privatised, starting off with a family ‘tailgate party’(an informal car-park meal) before each spectator strolls to his or her seat.
By contrast, most British supporters walk the last part of the way to the stadium and derive a greater sense of excitement, anticipation and being part of a crowd.
Guttmann (1986:10) reports that 74 per cent of North American Soccer League spectators are college-educated, and 45 per cent are women.
Whilst Roadburg may underestimate the size of the middle-class and female components of the British soccer crowd, he is correct to emphasise that the terraces are chiefly made up of working-class males and that, of this group, it is the youth segment which most often engages in violence.
Roadburg surmises that adolescent gang violence against persons and property is common to both societies, but that soccer acts as a vehicle of expression for deprived or disaffected youth in Britain in a way which is not possible in America.
Roadburg seems to be suggesting that certain characteristics of the  British fans' involvement in the game (partisanship, segregation, collective identity and pre-match build-up) give rise to a greater degree of passionate commitment (and enhanced potential for disorder) than in the American equivalent.
He gives equal emphasis to the possibility that such characteristics make the game an ideal vehicle for aggressive confrontations between rival groups of young males.
As we shall see in a later section, these views are consistent with the current thinking of several British theorists on soccer spectator violence.
Violence at baseball matches
As Fimrite points out, the popular, working-class sport of baseball has a disorderly tradition.
The baseball fan at the beginning of the century — free of the possibly inhibiting influence of women spectators and close enough to the playing field in those tiny ball parks to take immediate action against erring players or umpires — was, by all accounts, an abysmal churl.
(Fimrite, 1976:204)
In the intervening decades, there was ‘a general trend toward spectator civility’(Talamini, 1987:66), only for aspects of disorder to creep back into the sport by the 1970s.
A catalogue of disorderly incidents have occurred at baseball matches in the last two decades.
Players, umpires and rival fans have found themselves being physically attacked by objects as varied as flashlight batteries and souvenir baseball bats (Edwards and Rackages, 1977; Fimrite, 1976; Talamini, 1987).
During the past two decades there have also been a number of disorderly sequels to championship victories.
For example, when Detroit triumphed over the San Diego Padres in the 1984 World Seriff,
A riot reigned for two and a half hours after the last game ended.
The crowds burned one police car, destroyed five others, threw bottles at helmeted police, torched an overturned taxi, and ripped sod from the playing field at Tiger Stadium.
(Talamini, 1987:67)
Popular wisdom suggests that baseball crowd violence is due to a combination of the macho tendencies of 20- to 30-year-old males, fuelled by the heavy consumption of beer.
The growth of baseball ‘rowdyism’ in the late-nineteenth century has been an inverse function of diminishing female attendance at the game (Guttmann, 1986:114–15).
Crowd-control measures have focused on the limitation or prohibition of alcohol, and the  installation of special family enclosures, usually patrolled by extra security personnel (ibid.).
Fimrite (1976:204) disputes that alcohol is to blame for the apparent upsurge of violence in the 1970s.
As he says, ‘there has been beer in the ball parks for years’.
He posits that some of the changing trends in baseball violence are due to the increased commercialisation of the sport.
From the early part of this century,
the ball parks grew larger and the players, seen from a greater distance, grew smaller, less familiar, less vulnerable.
From afar, they looked like heroes, and for at least 30 years or more there was a general trend toward spectator conformity.
The ball diamond was a sanctuary not to be broken into by philistines.
Then, too, there was no television to tantalize the show-offs.
(Fimrite, 1976:204)
In recent years, the affective bond between players and fans has weakened.
Increasingly, stars are accused of disloyalty to the hometown team for ‘callously’ seeking transfers to teams in higher leagues; or perceived as just ‘another member of the Establishment’for spending too much time haggling over pay and fringe benefits.
There has consequently developed ‘an alienation of affections between fan and athlete’.
This, and the growing trend in American society to express displeasure more vociferously and outspokenly than in the past, is said to lie at the root of recent player-directed violence (ibid.:204–5).
It is evident from the above profile that baseball spectator disorder tends not to involve fighting between opposing groups of disorder.
Rather, it typically involves acts of aggression towards players and officials, or over-exuberant celebratory activity including the vandalism of property.
As such, it does little to help explain the fighting behaviour of British hooligans.
GENERAL MODELS OF SPECTATOR DISORDER
How far, then, do general models of spectator disorder inform our understanding of hooligan behaviour?
There are several such approaches in the American literature.
Some researchers emphasise the potentially arousing effect of watching aggressive contact sports (Goldstein and Arms, 1971; Harrell, 1981; Russell, 1983).
However, the futility of this approach becomes apparent if we compare the levels of disorder at soccer, boxing and ice-hockey events.
Soccer is the least violent sport of the three, but the one most synonymous with crowd disorder (Pilz, 1988:168–9).
A second category of explanations employ functionalist approaches to the study of spectator disorder.
Smith (1976), for example, adopts Smelser's framework of analysis (see Chapter 1) as a basis for understanding football hooliganism.
Structural conduciveness , as applied here, deals with those features of a situation which predispose it to disorder.
Here Smith (1976) includes ‘natural rivalries’ between spectators, based on nation, region, religion, ethnicity, etc.; the absence of channels for expressing grievances, as in industrially underdeveloped or politically undemocratic societies; the possibility of communication among the aggrieved (e.g. the ‘cheek-to-jowl congestion at soccer stadia’or the dissemination of rumour or hostile beliefs via the media); and the ‘accessibility of objects of attack’, such as referees or unsegregated soccer fans.
As Smith points out, ‘Conditions of conduciveness merely make the hostile outburst possible.
The existence of a strain, conflict, deprivation or ambiguity, usually accompanied by stereotyped beliefs assigning responsibility for evils to other groups, is the second structural determinant’(ibid.:206).
To illustrate this point, he refers to the Honduras-EI Salvador ‘soccer war’ of 1969 in which a series of hotly contested border disputes provided the context for three riotous soccer matches in the World Cup qualifying rounds.
The growth and spread of a hostile belief is necessary to give meaning to the structural strain, possibly by assigning responsibility and designating a certain response as appropriate.
‘Prior to and during the three game Honduras-EI Salvador series, for example, the press reported charges of ‘mistreatment’ of Honduras fans at the hands of El Salvadoreans and accusations of ‘brutality’directed at players on both teams.’
(ibid.).
Precipitating incidents , such as rough play or disputed refereeing decisions, have the effect of narrowing hostile beliefs into ‘specific antipathies’.
It is at this stage that the mobilisation of participants for action begins.
Often, the behaviour of one spectator may (however unwittingly) serve as a model for others.
From then on, the shape and extent of the ensuing disorder will depend on the prior organisation of the crowd, the ecology (or lay-out) of the stadium, and the response of the police.
Smith favours the view that decisive policing will most effectively quell the rioting, but concedes that premature intervention may well generate uncontrollable panic.
An alternative functionalist approach has been attempted by Edwards and Rackages (1977).
These authors see the spectating of sporting events as functional for society.
During times of economic and political stability, on-the-field sports violence allows for tension release, through vicarious identification with the aggressor.
This helps the sports spectator to cope  with the frustrations and disappointments of everyday life (‘particularly those of instrumental relevance’) and helps reaffirm his/her commitment to society's values.
However, under conditions of social instability where the individual's deteriorating ‘life circumstances’ generate acute feelings of anxiety, sport may be incapable of providing adequate relief.
Thus there is a potential that ‘processesor relationships in the general society may transform on-the-field episodes of violent or non-violent sport into a catalyst precipitating violent collective behavior by spectators themselves’(ibid.:13).
Aside from the obvious problems associated with structural-functionalist approaches of this nature — chiefly the dubious assumption that violent behaviour is aberrant or irrational (Pearton, 1986:77)— each of these studies has serious limitations.
Smith's application of Smelser's model is forced to rely on an assortment of different examples and there is little sense of how well it applies to separate case studies.
The model contributes little to our understanding of why ‘hooliganism’ is synonymous with soccer, why it is more prevalent at certain times in history than others, and why it is predominantly a male, lower-working-class phenomenon.
Edwards and Rackages base their approach on the highly questionable premise that spectator violence is merely a playing out of tensions external to sport itself.
Going by their logic, we would expect to see riotous behaviour by stressed small business owners and financial investors at rugby union or American football matches.
But neither of these is common.
They fail to consider that the fans' cultural and historical relationship to a particular sport may be significant.
Even more damaging to their theory is the fact that sports spectator disorder is not always synonymous with economic problems.
Finally, it would have difficulties explaining the disorder accompanying championship victory, referred to above.
The need to differentiate between different types of riot and the contrasting meanings involved for the participants is recognised by Smith (1983).
Borrowing from the ideas of Marx (1972), Smith makes the basic distinction between issue-oriented riots and issueless riots.
The former typically involve some sort of ‘legitimating belief, i.e. ‘a belief, attitude, grievance, ideology, or definition of the situation held by riot participants that directly ties the riot to some problem in the social structure and justifies or explains (their) behaviour, at least to themselves (Smith, 1983:146).
By contrast, issueless riots are not usually underpinned by such legitimating belief: ‘Protest and demands for social change are not significant elements in the genesis of the issueless riot, nor does the issueless riot tend to result in changes in people's life conditions’(ibid.).
Smith then makes a finer distinction between four types of issue-oriented   riots (demonstration, confrontation, entry and defeat riots) and two forms of issueless riots (victory and time-out).
As Table 6.1 shows, there is a high degree of correlation between his typology of sports-crowd riots and the five types of violent sports disorder nominated by Mann and Pearce (1978).
Among the most relevant of these categories to the present discussion  are Smith's time-out riots, and Mann and Pearce's outlawry disorders.
The latter (where sports events provide groups of spectators with an opportunity to act out their violent tendencies) could easily relate to the behaviour of fighting crews.
Similarly, Smith maintains that:
Much of what is called soccer hooliganism smacks strongly of time-out behaviour.
Most of the scholarly literature on the subject suggests that hooligans are as much motivated by the desire for fun, excitement, and peer status as they are by ethnic, regional, or other animosities.
The latter seem more of a pretext for trouble than a cause of it.
(Smith, 1983:152)
Vamplew (1979:2f) states that, of the five types of disorder classified by Mann and Pearce, ‘all but remonstrance can be found at soccer grounds in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, though the majority of incidents appear to have been of the frustration or confrontation varieties’.
However, most contemporary football hooliganism corresponds to the outlawry of time-out forms manifested in fights between opposing fans and creating mayhem during trips abroad.
Thus the principal task of theories which specifically address modem football hooliganism is to account for these dominant forms of behaviour.
ACADEMIC EXPLANATIONS OF FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM
Theoretical explanations of soccer spectator violence occupy four distinct categories.
First, there is the early Marxist approach of Ian Taylor which emphasises that hooligan behaviour is a symbolic attempt by working-class fans to restore some control over a game which they feel increasingly alienated from.
Second, there is the ethogenic approach of Peter Marsh and his colleagues which sees soccer spectator violence as a ritual expression of masculine aggression.
A third explanation, the ordered segmentation approach of Eric Dunning and his co-workers, highlights the significance of lower-working-class gang structures and early socialisation as the key to understanding the patterns of aggression displayed by football hooligans.
A final group of approaches see football spectator disorder as a way of compensating for the loss of community caused by post-war industrial and urban development.
We begin by looking at one of the seminal theories of soccer spectator disorder, the Marxist approach of Ian Taylor.
Taylor's subcultural approach
Taylor's (1971a; 1971b) Marxist approach sees contemporary spectator violence as a consequence of the increasing loss of control experienced by working-class football supporters over a game which they previously regarded as theirs.
His central premise is that most English football clubs were established by working-class occupational groups.
For example, Sheffield United were founded by a group of cutlers (hence, their nickname, the ‘Blades’), while West Ham United (the ‘Irons’) were formed by workers at the Thames Iron Foundry.
Though these clubs grew and become more formalised, supporters were still able to maintain an illusion of participation in the team's affairs.
This was because players invariably came from the local community and, by meeting fans in pubs, clubs and at civic functions, somehow seemed accountable to them.
Similarly, managers and directors appeared to share an equivalent value orientation to the fans and were more receptive to their opinions.
Supporters could perceive themselves as part of ‘a collective and democratically-structured enterprise’.
The main reason why working-class youths did not invade the pitch in the 1930s was because the ground was theirs and the playing area was sacred (Taylor, 1971a).
Modern changes in the game — specifically its bourgeoisification and internationalisation — are held to have undermined this illusion of participatory democracy.
By bourgeoisification, Taylor is referring to the increasing emphasis within the game on comfort and entertainment manifested in such developments as the reconstruction of grounds as commercial stadia (with covered stands, seats and floodlights), the payment of large transfer fees and the freedom of contract for players which enabled them to command large salaries.
Internationalisation refers to the incursion of English soccer into European competitions.
Set against these developments, soccer hooliganism may be interpreted as ‘attempts by certain sections of the class to assert some inarticulate, but keenly experienced sense of control over the game that was theirs’(Taylor, 1971a:163).
According to Taylor it is the working-class element of the crowd, and not football's new, middle-class supporters, who have the most developed knowledge of, and commitment to, the club (i.e. they possess a true ‘soccer consciousness’).
For this ‘subcultural rump’,
To induce a goalkeeper by distraction to kick into touch is to win a symbolic victory which may affect the result and one side's league position.
Whereas to invade a pitch when a goal is disallowed may be felt magically as a way of reversing the referee's decision.
And in the most final sense of all, to be arrested while fighting opposing supporters may  be felt as a way of conveying to the management by means of some psychic process the nature of the ‘really genuine supporter’, and the character of his identification.
(Taylor, 1971b:369)
There is general agreement that Taylor has oversimplified the traditional relationship which once existed between working-class supporters and their clubs.
Whannel (1979) doubts, for example, whether soccer clubs ever were participatory democracies.
He points out that, of the sixty-six English clubs founded in the nineteenth century, forty were limited companies before 1900, and there were a further nineteen by 1914.
Dunning's and his co-workers' (1984) historical survey of Football Association minutes and reports contained in the Leicester Mercury also provides evidence of pitch invasions and other forms of crowd disorder as early as the 1890s.
These outbreaks were typically spontaneous and unpremeditated; there is no evidence of a football resistance movement in action.
A further weakness of the theory is that it does not explain why so much hooligan activity is based on fan rivalries within the working class; nor can it deal with Wagg's (1984:198) observation that ‘the most notable attempts by a club's following to prevent it parting with a popular player or manager have usually been initiated by middle-class people’.
In a later subsection, we shall see how Taylor has since reformulated his approach to soccer hooliganism.
For the time being, we move on to the second of our theoretical perspectives, the ethogenic approach.
The ethogenic approach
The ethogenic approach looks upon football hooliganism as a ritualised expression of aggression, resulting from a need to demonstrate dominance and masculinity (Marsh et al., 1978).
According to this conception, disorder is rule-governed: much of the ‘aggro’ which occurs is largely symbolic, comprising a relatively harmless repertoire of threats, stares, denigratory chants and gestures (cf.
Marsh, 1975:9).
Comfortingly, almost, Marsh and colleagues (1978) explain that aggro seldom results in serious injury.
This is because those involved tend to be aware of the unwritten set of rules which determine when it is legitimate to attack and when to desist.
Aggro is likely to be considered appropriate in situations where opposing fans attempt a territorial invasion of their rivals' ‘end’; where one hooligan fan stares at, or adopts a threatening posture towards an opponent, or calls him a demasculatory name, such as‘cunt’, ‘wanker’, or ‘poofta’.
Alternatively, some types of incident on the  field of play — notably the scoring of a goal, foul play by a member of the opposing team or a bad refereeing decision — may also serve as instigatory cues.
A different set of rules then operate to impose limitations on the expression of aggro.
Generally speaking, such rules specify that violence should cease when honour has been satisfied.
A ‘smack in the mouth’ will usually be sufficient, especially if the opponent then backs down or buttons his lip.
In situations involving large numbers on both sides, honour will be satisfied by ‘running’ the opposition supporters (i.e. causing them to flee).
Life on the ‘end’ offers the actual or aspiring hooligan an alternative career as part of the ‘Rowdies’: ‘This ‘career structure’gives some young people a sense of individual achievement within a semi-formal setting opportunities denied to them in most other institutions' (Marsh, 1976:348).
The ‘Rowdies’ are the regular hooligans who routinely chant and denigrate the opposition.
Next come the older ‘Town Boys’ who are content to rest on their laurels and do not usually become involved in the aggro.
Of all those present, the ‘Aggro Leader’ enjoys most status, for he is the one who most commonly leads the sorties into the opposition (though his behaviour stays strictly within the rules).
This cannot be said of the ‘Nutter’, whose conduct is the exception which proves the rules.
The fact that other fans recognise his behaviour as deplorable and ‘beyond the pale’ is seen as proof that most fans have a tacit knowledge of the rules of disorder.
According to Marsh and his colleagues (1978) police intervention is often welcomed by the hooligans in so far as their presence provides a safety valve and prevents the aggro from going too far.
However, rules of propriety also apply to police conduct.
Should they use what is regarded as excessive or unnecessary force, they, too, might well become the targets of aggression.
The ethogenic approach is open to two major criticisms.
First, it makes no attempt to explain the class-specific nature of football hooliganism.
And second, the theory grossly underestimates the severity of some forms of spectator violence.
Witness Harrison's description of the Cardiff v .
Manchester United match in 1974:
At about 2.15, someone from the Cardiff side threw the first stone, then the bricks started flying: if they couldn't get at each other on land, then they could always fight a missile war and there was plenty of ammo flying around: the workmen who put the fence in had not swept up the chunks of broken concrete around the supports.
Swathes opened up in the crowds on either side as they saw the brickbats coming.
I saw three people hit in the face, one above the eye, one in the ear, one on the  nose, blood streaming down them.
Great cheers went up when a hit was scored, or when the police dragged someone out on the opposite side.
(Harrison, 1974:602)
Since the 1980s, football hooligans have displayed a callous cunning and organisation.
Pickering (1985:473) points out that members of West Ham United's Inter City Firm once settled an old grudge against Millwall's Bushwackers by throwing a rival hooligan under a passing train and stabbing another before leaving their personalised calling card: ‘Nothing personal.
The Inter City Firm.’
On another occasion, it was the turn of Millwall fans to pursue coaches carrying Bristol City supporters across London.
The police had prohibited any confrontation at the game, so the Bushwackers tracked their intended quarry in their cars, communicating with each other on CB-radio (Observer , 2 June 1985).
The ordered-segmentation approach
The ordered-segmentation approach shares the Marxist view that hooligans come predominantly from the lower-working class (Dunning et al., 1986; 1988).
Arrest statistics show an over-representation of people from a small number of working-class estates noted for their toughness and vandalism (Williams et al., 1984).
In order to explain this demographic effect, Dunning and co-workers borrow the concept of ordered segmentation, developed by the American sociologist, Gerald Suttles.
This concept focuses on the idea that masculine gang structures, based on age-grading, sex segregation and territorial identification, are a particular characteristic of lower-working-class communities.
Though keen rivals, such gangs have a propensity to combine against a common enemy.
In football terms, this implies that little ‘segments’ of working-class communities, which are normally in opposition, may combine in the name of the local football club to confront the common threat posed by opposition supporters.
At a superseding level of conflict, northern fans (from, say, Manchester and Liverpool), may fight side by side against the visiting fans of a southern team (e.g. Arsenal).
Taken to its logical conclusion, it is possible that the same three groups of supporters may combine to ‘represent’ England in an overseas confrontation with continental supporters (Williams et al., 1984).
For Dunning and colleagues, the aggressive predisposition of these youths is linked to a socialisation process known as the sociogenesis of masculine aggression .
From a very early age, lower-working-class boys  engage in rough, exclusively masculine forms of play, free of adult supervision.
Unlike middle-class children, they are seldom exposed to a parental emphasis on self-control; instead, there is an accent on physical punishment, and aggressive tendencies are further reinforced by the regular occurrence of intra- and inter-family feuds.
In this environment, toughness is valued by both sexes and, as the boys grow into youths, the status and prestige they are unable to achieve via education and employment is derived from their ability to fight (Dunning, 1990:76).
As stated previously, Dunning and colleagues (1984) show how football crowd violence had a low level of incidence in the post-war years, but rose in frequency from the mid-sixties on.
This is partly attributable to the increased opportunity for away travel which has increased the contact between rival groups of supporters.
However, Dunning and colleagues see the chief reason as the gradual acceptance by increasing numbers of working-class people of middle-class norms of behaviour.
From 1914 to the early 1960s, such factors as growing affluence, better education, the rising influence of trade unions and greater female participation in the workforce fostered a ‘civilising’ process.
However, not all sections were ‘incorporated’ in this way: ‘whilst the ‘respectable’sections of the working class have increased in size, the gap between them and the dwindling lower-working class, including the sections who remain ‘rough’, has widened' (ibid.:237–8).
The fact that youths from this category have been drawn increasingly to football since the 1960s is put down to possibilities offered for violence, as revealed by the mass media.
It was in the early 1960s that, parallel to its growing emphasis on the ‘disturbing activities’ of working-class youth, the media also began to focus on minor incidents of soccer crowd violence.
This may have been due to the fact that preparations for hosting the 1966 World Cup Finals were under way and there were fears that, as the English game came under greater international scrutiny, football hooliganism could damage the nation's prestige.
It was soon realised that media reporting of crowd disorder boosted the sales of newspapers — a matter of importance in an increasingly competitive industry.
Very soon, soccer grounds became ‘advertised’ as somewhere where a good fight was guaranteed, hence their appeal to the ‘rough’sections of society.
Alarmed by this influx, many ‘respectable’ fans vacated their regular places on the end terraces and congregated in the stands.
The resulting division of the ‘home’ and ‘away’ends thus became an established feature of the game.
As media coverage persisted and grew even more sensational, ‘league tables’ developed based on reputations for toughness.
Here the masculine ethos of the game and its implications for the reputation of working-class communities becomes relevant.
Given the large crowds, moreover, professional soccer provides a context where it is relatively easy to escape detection and arrest, and last but not least, a group of outsiders, the opposing team and its fans, comes regularly into the home territory where they are perceived as invaders and targets for attack.
A corollary is that these fans derive pleasurable excitement from going on away trips and invading the territories of opposing fans.
They are engaged in a kind of war game and one of their principal aims is to move with impunity in the sections of stadia favoured by home fans like themselves and to establish momentary control over the city centre pubs and other areas favoured by their home counterparts.
It is also their aim to fight and establish physical dominance over their rivals or at least to make them run away.
(Dunning, 1990:77)
Dunning and colleagues do not pretend that football hooligans are drawn exclusively from the lower working class, or that all lower-working-class adolescents and young adults use the game as a context for fighting.
They merely suggest that younger elements of the ‘rough’ working class are ‘the most central and persistent offenders in the more serious forms of football hooliganism’(Dunning et al., 1988:213).
The same authors fail to provide an entirely convincing explanation of why non-working-class hooligans (the so-called ‘soccer casuals’) are attracted to the violence.
They can only suggest that their involvement may be due to such personal circumstances as geographical proximity to ‘rougher’ areas, conflict with parents or school authorities or an opportunity to act out racist tendencies.
‘They may even become match-day ‘organizers’ or ‘planners’.
However, they are not, typically, regular fighters.
nor are they in our experience typically involved in the fighting end of the more seriously violent incidents' (ibid.:214–15).
A participant observation study of Sheffield United fans, purporting to show that hooligan supporters come from a variety of social backgrounds (Armstrong and Harris, 1991) has been justifiably criticised by Dunning and colleagues (1991) for its methodological shortcomings and contradictory presentation of evidence.
Nevertheless, anecdotal evidence suggests that Dunning and colleagues may have overstated the extent to which hooligans originate from the lower working class.
Chelsea's Anti-Personnel Firm mainly come from affluent London suburbs, places like Croydon, Harlow, Slough, and new towns like  Bracknell and Milton Keynes.
They are from upper-working-class, semi-affluent backgrounds, the Demi-Semis .
Loyalty to urban football clubs stems from when their parents used to live in inner-city areas.
Support for the old team increases, rather than decreases, when the families move out.
‘It's my roots.
Know what I mean?’
(Observer , 2 June 1985)
As we are about to discover, this evidence is more consistent with the next body of explanations to be considered in this section — those which emphasise the loss of working-class community as their key explanatory variable.
The magical recovery of community
A third group of academic theories locate the origins of contemporary football hooliganism in the post-war demise of working-class communities.
These writers have put ‘football hooliganism’, and developments among working-class youth generally, into the broader context of the social history of Britain since 1945 — in which the breaking up of traditional working-class communities, industrial decline, rising unemployment and periodic panics about unruly youth have all been pre-eminent.
Common to much of the literature has been a notion…that these kids — and many others like them — have been trying to ‘recover magically’ territory, both physical and cultural, that they have lost and to appropriate in the same way territory that has never been theirs.
(Wagg, 1984:204)
With the gradual decline of established occupations and trades went massive rehousing and the breakdown of community and neighbourhood ties.
With the onset of greater affluence and associated higher wages, came the privatisation and commercialisation of leisure.
The wages for many teenage and low-paid workers rose correspondingly.
These developments led to a changing relationship between many sections of the working class and the game they were once so slavishly loyal towards.
For the latest generation of skilled working-class adults and their families, leisure became more privatised: pubs and clubs were no longer a source of attraction unless they catered for couples and promised an evening of entertainment.
Likewise, football was to be consumed like any other consumer product — only if it offered the prospect of excitement — often as a TV spectacle in the comfort of one's own home.
Working-class youths now had a new range of ‘industries’— notably popular music and clothing — to cater for their needs.
However, for one section of youth, the lower-working-class ‘roughs’, living on housing estates and high-rise flats, for whom the prospect of unemployment was added to the possibility of boring, unskilled work, ‘only the football ground remained — stark, dirty, exposed to the elements — as a traditional gathering place for working-class lads’(Wagg, 1984:206–7).
For such people, the haven of the soccer ground offered a venue for new coalitions and a rejuvenated sense of community.
As Robins' and Cohen's (1978) study of Arsenal supporters shows, great importance was attached to the defending or taking of ends.
But the significance of this terrace solidarity went much further than this.
It is as if , for these youngsters, the space they share on the North Bank is a way of magically retrieving the sense of group solidarity and identification that  once went along with living in a traditional working-class neighbourhood.
(Robins and Cohen, 1978:137)
According to them, the subsequent involvement of skinhead supporters contributed to the notoriety of the ends.
Yet the skinheads neither created nor were created by the ‘end’.
What it gave them was a visible stage, a public platform — and what they gave back to the ‘end’ was a sense of itself, a common life-style.
The skinhead phenomenon rallied the mass of young supporters on the terraces, and brought more kids in.
(Robins and Cohen, 1978:139)
A slightly different slant is provided by Clarke (1978), who maintains that, in developing their earliest relationship to the game, young working-class fans brought with them traditional soccer/shop-floor values, such as partisanship, toughness, masculinity and collectivism.
The working-class youth had inherited a traditional way of watching a match,
seeing it not as a game between two teams but between his team and the opposition, a position which not only gave him a particular involvement, but also particular rights of commentary and criticism on the team, the management and the club.
(Clarke, 1978:43)
Recent changes in adult leisure behaviour meant that youths were less likely to be accompanied to the game by older male relatives who had previously ‘educated’ them in terms of the appropriate way to behave.
Thus previous restraints on terrace behaviour no longer operated.
The young, working-class fan had inherited the tradition without some of the controls on behaviour that accompanied it (ibid.:51–2).
Equally important were post-war developments in the game of football.
The post-war period had witnessed the growing professionalisation of the sport.
This was partly a reference to how the game was played: its new emphasis on the professional foul, dossiers on opposition players, new fitness training methods and greater tactical awareness.
Equally important, however, was the increasing commercialisation of the game via extra seating, bars, restaurants, social clubs and executive boxes.
Alongside this professionalisation was a parallel emphasis on the spectacularisation of football — i.e. an attempt to make it more attractive and eye-catching via such devices as pre-match and half-time entertainment and the regular televising of match highlights.
For Clarke, football hooliganism developed at the intersection of these trends: the fans have now taken the traditional values of toughness, masculinity, local identity, collective action and partisanship and made them part of the game's new, more spectacularised style.
The collective chanting of slogans and songs, the taking of ends and the solidaristic expressions of violence are merely the ‘old ways’ manifested in an unrestrained and more spectacular form.
Holt (1989) puts forward a synthesis of these ideas.
For him, the breakdown of working-class communities has meant that the traditional means by which men taught their relatives and apprentices how to hold their drink, and how not to allow occasional street brawls to get hopelessly out of hand, have disappeared.
Since the 1950s the old solidarities of working-class culture have disappeared.
So too have many of the communities themselves.
Networks of neighbours have been broken up by rehousing.
Sons are far less likely to follow their fathers or other male relatives into the same occupations or places of work.
Football since the 1950s has come to provide a kind of surrogate community for the young; the club defines their identity and the ‘end’ is their territory, even if they have moved out to the high-rise blocks miles away.
(Holt, 1989:337)
Holt is not surprised that many football hooligans come, not from lower-working-class housing estates, but from the affluent suburbs and new towns away from the major conurbations: ‘When a group have lost their old territory in which their traditions were established, football provides a  symbolic substitute for the young in the heart of the old community’(ibid.:339).
Taylor (1982; 1989) has recently recast his views on soccer hooliganism, bringing them closer to other approaches described in this section.
His most recent work finds him distinguishing between two separate ‘fractions’ of the dislocated working class who have become involved in soccer violence as a result of the peculiar material circumstances affecting their daily lives.
Taylor's starting point is the assertion that Britain has the ‘worst educated’ youth population of any advanced society.
The under-resourced state system produces cohorts of unqualified, unemployed or underemployed youths whose ‘conditions of existence’ are characterised by a moral, cultural and experiential shallowness.
For one section of youth, the ‘upwardly mobile, individualistic fraction of the (male) British working class’— epitomised by young dockers and construction workers — the restructuring of British industry over the past twenty years has produced relative prosperity.
Despite their lack of formal education and training, they can afford to travel to overseas matches where their crude moral values are reflected in ‘nationalistic aggression’ towards foreign fans.
A second, more troublesome fraction exists at the lowest end of the working class.
This consists of a less affluent underclass of young males who, unlike previous generations, cannot rely on the prospect of a steady job and membership of a well-integrated occupational community to nourish their sense of security and esteem.
Involvement in hooligan activity plays a significant part in their lives — by providing its own mechanism of recognition and reward.
Critics of this theoretical approach emphasise that spectator violence existed before the First World War.
It therefore seems unreasonable to see it as a result of the fragmentation of working-class communities (Dunning et al , 1984).
Moreover, there is documentary evidence that adolescents have always attended the game without the supervision of adults.
Dunning and colleagues conclude that authors like Clarke are guilty of romanticising working-class history, ‘attributing to it a degree of family, inter-age-group and neighbourhood solidarity it has probably never possessed’(ibid.:237).
DISCUSSION
Contemporary British football hooliganism most commonly takes the form of fighting behaviour between rival groups of fans.
Though the American literature on spectator disorder generally contributes few useful insights, Smith's distinction between issue-oriented and issueless riots helps to highlight the crucial difference between hooligan behaviour and the other forms of public disorder referred to in previous chapters.
Whereas the disorder associated with violent demonstrations, riots or industrial confrontation tends to focus on the defence or assertion of ‘rights’ which are perceived as being violated or denied, football hooliganism is an issueless form of activity, pursued primarily for pleasure and excitement, and to achieve the status and respect of one's peers.
The flashpoints model is therefore inapplicable to this form of disorder and other explanations are therefore necessary.
Each of the theoretical approaches outlined above is vulnerable to specific criticisms.
Nevertheless, it is possible to combine the most feasible aspects of a number of these theories into a reasonably coherent explanation of football hooliganism.
This explanation may be summarised as follows:
1
Football hooliganism is largely engaged in by young males whose position in society leaves them culturally and materially deprived.
They tend to receive an unsatisfactory education, harbour poor employment prospects and have few ways of creating a positive self-concept.
2
Hooligans tend to come from social backgrounds where masculine aggression is highly valued.
They live in (or their parents once came from) lower-working-class neighbourhoods which use toughness and fighting prowess as a criterion of status and respect.
3
Post-war urban development has meant that occupational communities no longer exist to provide readily available jobs and cater for the social needs of adolescent males.
Aggressive tendencies on the part of young men are no longer held in check by the moderating influence of older males.
4
Membership of fighting crews provides a ‘surrogate community’ and offers a career structure for earning status and esteem.
5
The game of soccer is an ideal vehicle for acts of collective aggression, guaranteeing encounters between rival groups of supporters and providing emotive issues which serve as rallying points for aggressive behaviour.
6
The mass media have helped increase the prevalence of football hooliganism since the 1960s by advertising soccer grounds as places where fighting was likely to occur, and then by creating and enhancing the notoriety of particular groups of fans.
Several of the above points appear to be endorsed by Pearson's cogent account of what makes the hooligan tick:
In a singing community of his peers he comes alive and discovers a sense of membership which is denied him elsewhere: all the more reason to embrace the slightly devilish and glamorous identity which is thrown at you by ‘them’ and sing along, ‘We are the famous football hooligans!’
(Pearson, 1979:215)
Dunning and his co-workers are undoubtedly justified in maintaining that football hooliganism was prevalent in society long before the post-war decline of community life; and that it was common for young males to attend football matches without adult supervision before the 1960s.
While these observations undoubtedly discredit Clarke's theory, Holt's position remains intact.
His analysis emphasises that, as with the other forms of disorder considered in this book, soccer spectator disorder requires a conjunctural explanation.
Football hooliganism may well be older than the present century
But the specific forms of hooliganism are new; football crowds were not segregated by age before the 1960s; youth did not congregate around parts of football clubs as their territory — they had a larger territory and community which they shared with their older male relatives.
When there were fights at football matches there was no dramatic media coverage.
All of these features have combined to create the contemporary problem; hooliganism exemplifies to perfection the difficulty of disentangling what is new from what is old in social history.
(Holt, 1989:343)
The ‘Troubles’ in Northern Ireland
This chapter sits uncomfortably in a book about public disorder.
Some might argue that it would be more appropriate to treat the recent ‘Troubles’ in Northern Ireland (from 1968 to the present) as an example of guerrilla or civil warfare.
One reason for including them here is that the bombings and assassinations of today are the legacy of the civil disturbances of the 1960s.
As such, the escalating conflict in Northern Ireland offers a useful paradigm for predicting whether a similar process of escalation might feasibly occur on the British mainland.
A second reason is to show how recent British security developments are based on precedents set during the containment of the Irish conflict.
The chapter begins by examining the historical roots of the present Troubles.
It then traces the development of the conflict from the seminal activities of the Catholic civil rights protest of 1968 to the introduction of the British Army in 1972.
A third section documents and analyses the increasingly repressive role played by the security forces and the corresponding violence employed by insurgent civilian paramilitary organisations.
Finally, the chapter evaluates the likelihood of recent patterns of conflict in Northern Ireland being reproduced elsewhere in Britain, and briefly explains how the security approach developed in the ‘orange state’ has served as a model for British police practices.
A TROUBLED PAST
The present Troubles in Northern Ireland are the most recent manifestation of a centuries-old history of conflict.
Between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries, a succession of English monarchs made a series of expansionist forays into the neighbouring country of Ireland.
As early as Al) 1250, Norman leaders had subjugated most of Ireland's Gaelic population.
Fifty years of guerrilla-style rebellion by the Gaels gradually reduced  the amount of territory controlled by the invaders to a small enclave around Dublin, known as the Pale.
There settlers established the earliest English plantation in Ireland.
Further attempts by the English to extend their presence in Ireland were successfully resisted.
A fierce uprising in 1534 was suppressed by Henry VIII, who declared himself King of Ireland in 1541.
England was a Protestant country, while the Gaels were almost exclusively Catholic.
The Church of Ireland was formed in 1560 to convert the Irish to Protestantism.
These and other English ways were resisted.
In 1579, when the Gaels attempted to forge an alliance with Spain, the English slaughtered thousands of Irish people, destroying their crops and livestock.
As a result, the English jurisdiction over Ireland extended across Leinster, Munster and Connacht, leaving only the remote and troublesome province of Ulster as an unsubdued Gaelic stronghold.
However, by 1607, the last of the Ulster chieftains had either been routed or driven into exile and, in six of the nine counties, English and Scottish settlers arrived to consolidate colonial rule and the English monarchy.
By 1640, 100,000 planters had arrived in Ireland when the native population numbered only one million inhabitants.
In 1641, the Gaels rebelled again, this time against their most immediate oppressors, the Protestant planters.
Further uprisings occurred until 1649 when Oliver Cromwell, fresh from his victory in the English Civil War, brutally put down the recalcitrant Gaels.
Many Catholics were banished to the west and south of their country.
Some twenty-six of the thirty-two counties of Ireland were subsumed by the English government, with large sections of land being awarded in payment to those who had fought and financed the war.
More conflict followed the arrival of the deposed Catholic King, James II, in Ireland in 1689.
The exiled monarch rallied an Irish Catholic army to do battle against his usurper from the English throne, the Dutch Protestant prince, William of Orange.
James besieged the Ulster city of Derry, but its 35,000 Protestant inhabitants successfully defended it, due largely to the leadership and example of the ‘Apprentice Boys’.
One year later, William arrived with his army in Ireland and proceeded to defeat James's Irish troops and their French allies at the River Boyne near Drogheda.
These victories at Derry and the Boyne have hallowed places in Protestant folklore.
Following James's defeat, more Catholic land was confiscated, leaving them with a mere 14 per cent share of Irish territory.
Then, harsh Penal Laws were introduced, forbidding Catholics from entering public employment, voting in local or parliamentary elections, openly practising their  religion and carrying firearms.
The law also abolished the principle of primogeniture (the direct passing on of land to the first-born son), save for those cases where the eldest male was prepared to embrace Protestantism.
Unless this occurred, the land was divided equally amongst all the male heirs, reducing the size of Catholic plots.
The end of the eighteenth century saw the development of the United Irishmen movement, a body (including many prominent northern Protestants) committed to greater equality for Catholics.
Unwilling to allow legal reforms like the Catholic Relief Act 1793 (which repealed some aspects of the Penal Laws) to appease them, the movement rose up in rebellion in 1798.
The rebellion was crushed by the British Government, which then passed an Act of Union in 1801, abolishing the Dublin parliament and integrating Ireland with the UK.
The Irish — politically and militarily outmanoeuvred — were allocated 100 of the 660 seats at Westminster.
Restrictions on trade were lifted but, due to the expropriation of Irish wealth, only Ulster — and Belfast in particular— was able to flourish under the Union.
This growth and industrial expansion of Belfast, and a corresponding famine in the south, facilitated a dramatic rise in the city's Catholic population (from 6 per cent in 1800 to over 30 per cent in 1861).
However, because the Catholics had little share in the city's wealth creation, they continued to identify with the nationalist tendencies of the southern Irish majority.
In the 1885 British election, the nationalist Home Rule Party won eighty-five seats at Westminster (including seventeen out of thirty-three in Ulster).
Finding themselves holding the balance of power in parliament, they managed to introduce the Home Rule Bill of 1886.
This, and a second bill in 1893, were both defeated.
However, a third bill was passed in 1914, but not implemented due to the outbreak of the First World War.
Protestant Unionists had begun to respond to this threat to their supremacy by organising a private army, the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), said to have had the backing of the Conservative Party and the British military establishment.
In the south, recruiting began for the Irish National Volunteers.
When war broke out with Germany, many UVF members and National Volunteers joined the armed forces.
However, some remnants of the latter (the Citizen Army and Sinn Fein Volunteers) seized Dublin in 1916 and proclaimed it an Irish republic.
This ‘Easter uprising’ was soon put down, its leaders rounded up and shot.
The 1918 General Election heralded the political ascendancy of Sinn Fein(the Gaelic for ‘ourselves alone’).
The party won seventy-three out of 105 available Irish seats, thus ousting the United Irish League (the old  Home Rule Party) as the major Irish political force.
(Though, of the thirty-seven Ulster constituencies, the Unionists won twenty-two.)
Sinn Fein 's success was built around the pledge that, if elected, they would refuse to take up their seats in Westminster and set up a separate Irish parliament instead.
True to their word, Sinn Fein 's newly elected MPs soon convened the first meeting in Dublin of Dail Eireann and declared their independence.
Thereafter, a civil war was waged between the re-formed Irish Volunteers (soon to be known as the IRA) and the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC).
Originally fought out in the south and west of Ireland, hostilities then shifted to the north which became the focal point of paramilitary gun battles and sectarian rioting.
The Government of Ireland Act came into effect in May 1921.
As a result, two elections were held: one in the six counties of the north, and another for the Home Rule parliament in the south.
In the north, there was an 89 per cent turn-out which resulted in forty seats for the Unionists to six each for Sinn Fein and the Nationalist parties.
Consequently, on 22 June 1921, the King officially opened the new parliament and Northern Ireland was born.
This partition of Ireland into the twenty-six counties of the Irish Free State and the six counties of Northern Ireland has endured to this day.
(In 1949, following the Free State's secession from the British Commonwealth, the Irish Republic was formed.)
Within a year of partition, the Constabulary Act (NI) 1922 was passed, which provided for the formation of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).
This was a predominantly Protestant force which soon came to be regarded as repressive and bigoted by the Catholic minority.
The ‘B Specials’(a part-time force of largely Protestant volunteers) were retained to work alongside the RUC whenever necessary.
Police powers in Northern Ireland were virtually unlimited.
The Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act 1922 enabled the security forces to search and arrest arbitrarily, to detain suspects for up to 48 hours for the sole purpose of interrogation and to break up assemblies of three or more persons on the grounds that their presence might lead to a breach of the peace.
Under authority invested in the Minister for Home Affairs, the Act also provided for internment without trial, the imposition of curfews, the serving of exclusion orders against named persons, the prohibition and distribution of certain forms of literature, the banning of various associations and the death penalty for causing or attempting to cause an explosion likely to lead to injury.
As Walsh (1984:328) emphasis, the Special Powers Act remained unmodified until 1972.
‘The history of its application  throughout this period suggests that its more important function was to suppress all forms of challenge, whether peaceful or violent, to the hegemony of its unionist sponsors.’
The creation of the new state was seen as illegitimate by large sections of the southern population and by Catholics in the north.
The contested nature of this political arrangement was evident in skirmishes with the IRA in the 1920s, around the Second World War and in an extended campaign, lasting approximately from 1956 to 1962.
The present Troubles have been the most bitter and prolonged in recent Irish history.
Though an inexorable development of the centuries-old political struggle, we shall see how the present violence ‘was born of the denial of civil rights to the Roman Catholic minority.
The conflict itself has given birth to new violations of human rights, which have, in turn, been the impetus for further fighting’(Hewitt, 1982:153).
THE BASIS OF CONFLICT
In Ulster, some two-thirds of the population are Protestant (the Loyalist, or pro-British section of the country), while the remaining one-third is Catholic (Nationalist), defining itself as Irish.
The present wave of Troubles has its basis in the Catholic grievances about discriminatory practices which have operated against them ever since the state's inception (cf.
Darby, 1983).
To begin with, Catholics objected to religious discrimination reflected in the unfair allocation of jobs, housing and industrial investment.
A second serious cause of complaint concerned the heavy restrictions on the local election franchise which was not available to lodgers, sub-tenants and children under 21 living with their parents.
This cut out a quarter of people otherwise eligible to vote, the majority of whom were Catholics.
Moreover, the Representation of the People Bill 1946 entitled limited companies to up to six votes in local elections, depending on their rateable value.
This, too, operated to the advantage of Protestants.
A similar complaint surrounded the deliberate manipulation of ward boundaries (i.e. ‘gerrymandering’) to ensure the greatest possible representation of Protestant local politicians.
Finally, there was popular Catholic resistance to the implementation of the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act, and resentment at the retention of the B Specials, who were seen as drawn from, and biased towards, the Unionists.
This is insufficient to explain why radical protest suddenly became so salient in the late 1960s.
Part of the answer lies in the growth of an Irish Civil Rights movement, stimulated, in turn, by the emergence of a larger, better-educated Catholic middle class, less willing to accept a status of inferiority and blatant discrimination than earlier generations.
Two other political factors were pivotal.
First, there was the accession to power in Britain of the Labour Party, some of whom were sympathetic to the idea of ‘sensible reform’(Bew et al., 1979).
Second, there was growing Catholic disaffection from the moderate policies of the Catholic National Party.
The attitude of the Catholic working class was crucially important, not least because:
while everywhere else (including the Protestant community) the unskilled section of the working class was diminishing as a proportion of the work-force, in the Catholic community it was actually increasing.
No less than a quarter of the non-agricultural work-force was consigned to the residuum of unskilled labour, excluded not only from political life but also from social rewards.
This sector constituted an immense reservoir of opposition to Unionism and indifference to moderation.
(Bew et al., 1979:170–1)
The Civil Rights movement was given a major thrust forward by the ‘Caledon squatting incident’(20 June 1968).
This episode concerned activities in a small village located in the Dungannon Rural District.
There a local Northern Ireland MP occupied a council house in protest at the eviction of a Catholic family and reallocation of their house to a Protestant woman who did not rate as a priority for rehousing.
The incident received widespread television and press publicity, and prompted a civil rights march on 24 August from Coalisland to Dungannon.
The march, the first ever organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), involved 2,500 protesters and was peaceful from start to finish.
This was not true, however, of a similar march in Londonderry 2 months later.
THE LONDONDERRY MARCH AND THE ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE
The Londonderry march of 5 October 1968 was proposed, and initially only supported, by Londonderry left-wing and pro-Republican activists.
NICRA had been concerned about the potential for violence which arose when the Apprentice Boys of Derry gave notice of their intention to stage an ‘Annual Initiation Ceremony’ to coincide with the demonstration.
However, they agreed at the last moment to participate.
On 3 October, the Minister of Home Affairs prohibited all processions occurring within the city's walls, but the march took place as planned.
The influential Cameron Report, which traces the development of  conflict in Northern Ireland from June 1968 to May 1969 (see page 149), acknowledges that NICRA had no intention of staging a disorderly protest.
On the other hand,
The extremists of the left were anxious to ensure that there was a violent ‘confrontation’ with the police, and to organise opposition in the city on class lines.
Since these extremists had been principally responsible for the detailed organisation of the march it is not surprising that there were no serious plans to control it, or to ensure that it went off peacefully.
The chief marshal notified to the police appears to have been inexperienced and relatively ineffective.
(Cameron, 1969:27–8)
There were two related problems: first, the organisers greatly over-estimated the size of march (putting the likely turn-out at 5,000 when it was closer to 2,000); and second, the stewards included serving IRA members.
The Report makes it plain that the police ‘certainly expected trouble’.
They regarded NICRA as a ‘Nationalistic’ movement and saw the march as being ‘effectively in the hands of a small group of left-wing and Republican extremists in Londonderry’(ibid.:26).
Usually, only sixty officers were available but, on this occasion, 130 men had been assembled (ibid.:28).
It may also have been significant that the local County Inspector was on leave and that the County Inspector in charge of the RUC's Special Branch supervised the operation.
From the outset of the march, the demonstrators observed a different route to that notified to the police.
As they set off to cross a bridge already cordoned off as a prohibited area, the police hurriedly re-formed in front of them.
Two MPs at the apex of the march were batoned, apparently without instruction from the senior officer.
There was great confusion and indignation as the marchers were forced to halt.
A senior NICRA member appealed to the crowd to eschew violence, but could not be heard above the din.
Thirty more minutes elapsed without any further progress before she and several others appealed to the crowd to disperse.
At this stage, some demonstrators (reputedly, members of ‘Young Socialist Alliance’) threw placards and stones at the police.
Police were instructed to draw their batons and move in to disperse the marchers.
However, far from responding in an organised manner, ‘the police broke ranks and used their batons indiscriminately’(ibid.:29).
A second group of police assembled behind the marchers, effectively hemming them in.
Water cannons were then introduced and turned on marchers and innocent bystanders alike (ibid.).
The crowd was eventually scattered but, later that evening, the police  tried forcibly to remove a political banner at the city centre's War Memorial.
Some protagonists (said to be non-marchers) were chased into the Catholic Bogside area of the city, where barricades were erected, a number of petrol bombs were thrown, and some looting took place.
A group of stone-throwers were rapidly dispersed when members of the Reserve Force drove landrovers into them.
The resulting television and press publicity proved harmful to the authorities.
On 9 October, students at Queen's University, Belfast, set up the People's Democracy (PD) group, ‘a loose activist body committed to civil rights reforms, but with a tough Young Socialist hard core’(Farrell, 1980:247).
This movement was the instigator of a series of civil rights marches across the north, many of which provoked violence by Protestant counter-demonstrations.
Derry, in particular, seemed to be in a state of constant turmoil as marchers broke the government's ban on processions several times a day.
Something clearly had to be done.
On 22 November 1968, the Prime Minister, Terence O'Neill outlined an ameliorative package of reforms which, in amongst its other measures, encouraged local authorities to devise a points system for the allocation of housing; abolished the company vote for local elections; and repealed parts of the Special Powers Act.
However, as Farrell explains,
It was too little too late.
It was enough to outrage the Loyalists without satisfying the Civil Rights movement at all.
The whole campaign began to centre around ‘One man, One Vote’— effectively who controlled the gerrymandered councils.
O'Neill wouldn't concede it — it would have split the Unionist Party.
The Civil Rights movement wouldn't be satisfied without it.
(Farrell, 1980:248)
Consequently, there were a series of marches across Northern Ireland.
The most significant of these was the 4-day march from Belfast to Londonderry, starting on 1 January 1969.
This march was modelled on the famous Selma-Montgomery march of the American Civil Rights campaign.
As anticipated, it was systematically harassed by Loyalists.
(Subsequently, the RUC was accused of leading the marchers into an ambush consisting of stone-throwing, cudgel-wielding assailants, many of them off-duty B Specials.)
The march eventually reached its destination but, on the same night, barricades were erected against an RUC raid on the Bogside.
A pattern had now been established:
Protestants were ready to counter any organized Catholic action with  violence to ‘nip in the bud’ the violence of rebels.
Protestant violent action against Civil Rights marches was seen by Catholics as a threat to their communities.
They reacted to the Protestant violence with defensive counter-violence which was in turn interpreted by Protestants as a confirmation of their belief that the Civil Rights movement was a front organization for an armed Catholic rebellion.
(Easthope, 1976:417)
The resounding election victory of 21-year-old Bernadette Devlin, a student member of PD who stood as an anti-Unionist candidate, in the Mid-Ulster by-election on 17 April, was taken as affirmation of the minority's support for Civil Rights movement.
Confronted with this reality, O'Neill conceded the principle of ‘one man, one vote’, and the full parliamentary party voted it in on 22 April.
That night, two major water pipes were blown up, depriving Belfast of its water supplies.
This was allegedly perpetrated by Protestants intent on panicking the Unionist Party into bringing O'Neill down.
If this was their intention, they succeeded — by precipitating his resignation.
The election of O'Neill's successor, Major James Chichester-Clark, resolved nothing.
The Catholics, with their new-found self-confidence, were not prepared to accept unjust second-class citizenship, while Unionists were unwilling to relinquish generations of privilege and supremacy.
Things came to a head at the Apprentice Boys' parade in Derry on 12 August.
The parade was scheduled to proceed through the city and skirt round the walls overlooking the Bogside.
The march — an annual commemoration of the siege of Derry — was a provocative symbol of Protestant mastery.
It was stoned as it reached the Bogside; Catholics clashed with the RUC; and the Bogside Defence Association erected barricades.
Petrol bombs were thrown when the RUC drove armoured vehicles at the barricades.
CS gas was fired for the first time in Northern Ireland.
This was the prelude to 3 days and nights of conflict.
Several authors agree that the Bogside riot represented the symbolic defence of community (Easthope, 1976; Scarman, 1972).
Barricades were erected at the precise boundary of the two religious communities in an area of no-man's-land between a Catholic cathedral and a Protestant church, both rumoured to be threatened by attack.
Bayley and Loizos observe that:
very little fighting in Derry was of the hand to hand nature.
Generally in Ulster violence was directed against symbols rather than persons the burning of an Orange Order assembly hall, police stations, or post offices.
For example, people of the ‘wrong community’ in mixed  neighbourhoods were told to leave their houses, which were then burned; the people were then usually allowed to escape.
(Bayley and Loizos, 1969:278)
They had no desire to progress beyond their barricades: ‘Their whole rationale was that they were fighting a defensive battle for the protection of their community against arbitrary attack’(ibid.).
On 14 August, as sympathetic rioting flared up in other Ulster towns and cities, notably the Falls area of Belfast, the B Specials were brought in to replace the RUC on the edge of the Bogside.
However, in the early evening, British troops moved into Derry, and negotiations between the British commander and representatives of the Bogside Defence Association resulted in the withdrawal of B Specials.
The Catholics were euphoric at this outcome:
The Bogsiders felt that they had won — not only because they had kept the RUC out of their area but because they had forced the British Army to intervene.
They sensed vaguely that direct British intervention re-opened the whole constitutional question.
(Farrell, 1980:262)
THE SPIRAL OF REPRESSION
A brief truce followed the arrival of the British Army, but publication of two major government reports led to a resumption of the conflict.
On 12 September 1969, the Cameron Commission (referred to on pages 14–6) reported its findings.
The Commission validated the Civil Rights movement's complaints about gerrymandering and discrimination, pointed to evidence of violence and indiscipline among RUC officers, and noted the partisan attitudes and behaviour of the B Specials.
The Hunt Report, published on 10 October, recommended the disbandment of the B Specials and the disarming of the RUC.
The report also recommended the replacement of the B Specials by an Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), to consist of a locally raised militia.
This last proposal especially outraged the Loyalist communities who, apparently,
failed to understand that the UDR would also be charged with policing the border and the countryside and would, in fact, be somewhat more efficient in its vigilance against a dreaded IRA invasion.
All that the loyalists knew was that their very own Special Constabulary was going to be dismantled and that this had been one of NICRA's long-standing  demands.
The Hunt report was thus seen on the Shankill as a craven cave-in to Fenian rioters.
It had to be repudiated before its terms of surrender could take effect.
(Kelley, 1988:123)
On the night of 11 October, a day after Hunt's publication, Protestants gathered on the Shankill Road to attack the Catholic Unity Flats, threw stones and bottles at the British troops who were thwarting their advance, overturned cars and set them ablaze, and, unprecedentedly, directed gunfire at the RUC.
This fire was returned by police and army personnel.
The Catholics, too, organised and armed themselves in anticipation of a Protestant backlash or about-turn by the security forces.
Having played little part in the August riots (epitomised by the derisory slogan, ‘IRA — I Ran Away’), old IRA men came out of retirement (Rose, 1972) and ‘there was a steady stream of recruits from young men who had seen houses and streets burnt down by Loyalist mobs and who'd been unable to prevent them’(Farrell, 1980:267).
Such action widened the growing split between those Republicans (notably the Provisional IRA and Provisional Sinn Fein) who felt that military action was the key to Ireland's liberation, and those, like the official IRA and Sinn Fein , who considered that political means were still preferable (Hannigan, 1985).
The Army's preference to appear neutral was severely undermined by its role during the Loyalist marching season of 1970.
An Orange parade on 31 March was the prelude to 4 days of conflict between Catholics and the British Army in Ballymurphy.
Perceiving the Army as a protective cover for Loyalism, Catholics attacked the march as it went past the Cloned and Ballymurphy areas.
British soldiers saturated the latter area with CS gas before taking up occupation.
Catholics threw petrol bombs, provoking the British Commander to warn television audiences that future petrol bombers would be shot dead.
Escalation was relentless.
On 1 July 1970, the Criminal Justice (Temporary Provisions) Bill was rushed through Stormont.
This provided for a mandatory 6-month prison sentence for anyone found guilty of rioting.
Two days later, the Army raided a house in the Lower Falls where they found a collection of arms.
This action provoked another major riot.
Again, the Army flooded the area with CS gas.
Temporarily withdrawing in an attempt to draw out the IRA, they returned to occupy the area for a further 36 hours (Farrell, 1980:273).
A curfew was maintained and soldiers allegedly smashed down doors and destroyed furniture whilst conducting searches.
Not just illegal, it was also counter-productive, fuelling further resentment among Catholic families (McCauley, 1989:143).
The IRA responded with a bombing campaign directed at business and commerce.
From April to June 1971, there were 134 such bombings.
The Army was immediately authorised to shoot ‘with effect’ at anyone acting suspiciously.
This was followed, in August, by the blanket banning of all marches and the sudden implementation of an ‘intermentpolicy’(McGuffin, 1973).
On 9 August, 349 arrests were made as the military swooped to round up serving and former IRA activists.
However, due to poor intelligence and a tip-off to the IRA, most victims were civil rights agitators, not IRA supporters (White, 1989).
In the 4 days of violent rioting which followed, twenty-two people were killed, nineteen of them civilians.
The Catholic population was further incensed by revelations that a dozen internees had been beaten and subjected to sensory deprivation techniques while being interrogated.
These ‘five techniques’(requiring prisoners to wear hoods over their heads unless they were separated from other inmates or being interrogated, having them stand spreadeagled against a wall for up to 43 hours, depriving them of sleep, subjecting them to electronic noise and beating them) were subsequently condemned as ‘torture’ by the European Rights Commission (Hewitt, 1982:157–8).
The repression of the IRA continued unabated: 650 prisoners were interned by the end of November.
Many of these were transferred to an internment camp at Long Kesh near Lisburn.
In October, two women were shot dead by the Army for touring the Lower Falls with a siren, warning inhabitants of imminent raids.
The ‘Provos’ responded with an urban guerrilla offensive, consisting of attacks on the Army, RUC and Protestant civilians.
As Farrell (1980:287) explains, ‘Internment had turned a campaign of pinpricks into an all-out war.’
Things came to a head on 30 January 1971 when a NICRA march in Derry, rendered illegal by Faulkner's blanket banning of all marches the previous August, found its exit from the ghetto blocked by British soldiers, including the Parachute Regiment.
The Army and RUC had previously decided that, while the demonstration was too big to be prevented, it should none the less be confined to the ghetto.
Thus finding their exit blocked, most of the marchers respected the barriers.
Others began jeering and eventually threw bottles and stones.
The Army moved in with a water cannon and tear gas, forcing the marchers into hasty retreat.
But then, suddenly and without any warning, the army opened fire.
Panicked marchers and onlookers ran for cover.
They threw themselves down on the street or took shelter behind cars and in doorways.
Still the shooting continued — methodical, aimed, deliberate.
People were  being hit with live lead bullets and were screaming for help.
A priest ran out into the road and knelt beside a body which had shined the street red.
A couple of men waved white handkerchief frantically above their heads as they walked gingerly to where other forms were lying, deadly still.
When the firing stopped, 13 Catholic had been killed and 29 wounded, one of whom would die several weeks later.
Several of the original 13 dead were teenagers.
It was Bloody Sunday in the Maiden City.
(Kelley, 1988:163)
Official accounts of the shootings emphasised that soldiers responded to heavy IRA nail bombing and gunfire, suggesting that a major battle had taken place.
This version was contradicted by British press reporters who personally witnessed the killings (see p. 173).
‘Bloody Sunday’ provoked a retaliatory campaign of violence by the Provos.
This, in turn, prompted a political intervention.
In March 1972, the Conservative government suspended Stormont (the Northern Ireland Parliament) and assumed direct rule of the province.
Following the failure of militarisation and a sequence of abortive attempts at political reform, the British reverted in the mid-1970s to a policy based the ‘primacy of the police’.
This policy involved the ‘normalisation’ of citizen-authority relations in Ulster, i.e. an attempt to ‘portray the six counties as a ‘normal’part of the UK which needed civil policing rather than military invasion' (McCauley, 1989:144).
Henceforward the RUC would play the dominant security role with the Army gradually being phased out.
To facilitate this change, the Special Powers Act was superseded by two new pieces of legislation, the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act, introduced in 1973 and revised in 1978, and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974.
In Walsh's view,
This legislation is designed not only to counteract the violence by harsh, emergency measures, but also to undermine the political nature of the violence by characterising it as mere criminality; the hope being that it will diminish the level of public support for those involved.
(Walsh, 1984:335)
However, this process ‘has produced its own sequel of human rights violations’(Hewitt, 1982:158).
To begin with, the Emergency Provisions Act (EPA), established special ‘Diplock Courts’ where ‘scheduled’or ‘terrorist’offences (murder, or attempted murder, and explosive-related) are tried by a single judge in the absence of a jury.
Other provisions  ‘abolished the prohibition on hearsay evidence and rendered admissible as evidence ‘confession’ statements which, although involuntary, had not actually been obtained by torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, threats or inducements' (ibid.).
Section 11 of the Act authorises police officers to arrest anyone they suspect of being or having been involved in terrorist activity.
It is unnecessary for the suspicion to be reasonable; nor must the person be suspected of having committed an offence.
Once arrested, a person may be detained for up to 3 days without knowing what he/she is alleged to have done.
Another category of arrest is established under section 12.
In this case the initial suspicion must be reasonable, whereupon the person may be held for up to 7 days.
The Army has similar powers of arrest under section 14 of the Act, but detention may only last for up to 4 hours.
Walsh maintains that,
In practice, these powers are interpreted as authorising arrest for general questioning.
They are primarily used for screening purposes, intelligence gathering, surveillance and harassment.
As many as 90 per cent of the persons arrested under these powers are released without charge after having been detained for anything from four hours to seven days.
For many individuals the experience is repeated several times a year, thereby constituting a serious infringement of their personal liberty, disrupting the lives of their families, often preventing them from complying with requirements for obtaining welfare benefits and effectively making them unemployable.
(Walsh, 1984:336)
In addition to the aforementioned powers, police and Army personnel may stop and conduct random street searches on pedestrians or motorists for possession of unlawful munitions or transmitters.
On the appropriate authority of a senior officer, security personnel may enter a person's home for similar purposes.
They can stop people, without prior basis of suspicion, ask them for personal details or question them about their knowledge of recent terrorist incidents.
Another centrepiece of the government's emergency legislation is the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1974 (redrawn in 1976 and 1984), passed in the wake of the Birmingham pub bombings of November 1974, in which twenty-one people died as a result of two bomb blasts.
The Act enables the authorities to detain anyone ‘'reasonably’ suspected of being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism' (Hewitt, 1982:166) for up to 7 days, and to take out exclusion orders banning British and Irish citizens from leaving or entering Great Britain or Northern  Ireland on the grounds that they have been, or intend to become, involved in acts of terrorism.
The individual is never informed of what it is he (sic) is alleged to have done to give rise to the suspicion; nor, indeed, is it necessary that he be convicted of any offence.
The Secretary of State acts as judge, jury, prosecution and defence.
(Walsh, 1984:340)
A further controversial aspect of Westminster's normalisation programme was the abolition of the ‘special category’ status previously afforded to those convicted of scheduled offences.
Such people were based in separate areas of the prison, wore civilian clothes rather than prison uniforms and organised their daily activities independently of prison routines.
These privileges were a recognition of their ‘prisoner of war’ status.
Special category status was withdrawn on 1 March 1976.
In 1977, groups of Republican prisoners begun to campaign for its return by refusing to wear prison clothes or do prison work.
Such protesters were refused alternative clothing and lost any remission of their sentence.
A year later, the protest took a new form: the ‘dirty protest’ involved prisoners refusing to exercise or use toilet facilities.
Many prisoners spread their cell walls with their own excreta.
In 1980, the protest developed into a series of hunger strikes.
One of the strikers, Bobby Sands, was overwhelmingly elected as an MP in the Fermanagh and Tyrone by-election.
Sands died soon after his election, and was one of ten strikers to die in this way (Beresford, 1987; Collins, 1986).
There were riots in Belfast and Derry following Sands' death.
During one night of rioting, two youths were run over by Army landrovers.
The two drivers were later charged with dangerous driving, but it was widely suspected that they had been acting on orders.
Despite such setbacks to the normalisation policy, the RUC has continued to fulfil the security role vacated by the Army.
Indeed, the RUC has become a well-organised paramilitary force with a range of repressive powers.
AU RUC officers are trained in riot control and counter-insurgency techniques.
Military-trained rapid strike units, known as Headquarters Mobile Support Units and Divisional Mobile Support Units, were introduced in the early 1980s.
Partly composed of ex-British soldiers, these units place a priority on ‘speed, firepower and aggression’(Weitzer, 1985:48).
Brewer and co-workers (1988) report that, in 1981 alone, 30,000 rounds of plastic bullets were fired, compared with 55,000 in the 5 years  up to 1975.
Since 1974, over a dozen deaths have resulted from such shootings.
Freedom of association and expression have been two further casualties of the government's emergency powers.
The Public Order (Northern Ireland) Act 1981 makes it necessary for organisers to give the police 5 days' notice of a march for it to be considered legal.
Senior officers may also impose such conditions as a change of route or starting time in the interests of public order.
The Secretary of State may also prohibit any march in any area, or impose a blanket ban on all marches or a particular category of marches, for a period of 12 months.
These powers were employed with telling effect on a series of ‘H-block’ marches, when hundreds of people were arrested and convicted for taking part in prohibited marches or not observing the 5-day rule.
The Northern Ireland conflict has become progressively more covert in nature.
The RUC has the largest computerised surveillance system in the UK.
Strategically located road blocks are used to enforce systematic searches of traffic, and vehicle registration numbers are fed back to central control for checking.
Listening devices are used, sometimes involving the technique of monitoring conversations via vibrations made on window panes (Hillyard, 1985:180).
Cameras are secretly located in public places and helicopters monitor selected areas with video equipment, day and night (ibid.).
Recent insurgency campaigns have been correspondingly covert:
The targeting of the security forces by Republican paramilitaries is reflected in a rise in the number of members of the security forces killed as a proportion of total deaths.
For example, deaths of members of the security forces were 54 per cent of total fatalities in 1985, compared to only 18 per cent in 1976.
As a result of the policy of police primacy, an increasing proportion of these have been members of the RUC and RUC Reserve.
(Brewer et al., 1988:69)
Against this, there have been a series of controversial allegations against special police units engaged in covert action.
The most notorious of those centred on an incident in December 1982 when two unarmed members of the Republican paramilitary organisation, the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), were shot dead after police officers had stopped their car on the edge of Armagh.
This, and similar incidents, caused speculation that the RUC was operating a ‘shoot to kill’ policy.
An inquiry was authorised to look into these incidents, but when its chairperson, John Stalker, the Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, was suddenly  removed over allegations about his previous conduct as a police officer, it led to speculation that a cover-up was taking place to avoid implicating senior RUC officers in covert and probably illegal operations (ibid.:70).
Covert operations now extend well beyond Northern Ireland and the British mainland.
On 6 March 1988, three IRA members were shot dead in Gibraltar by plain-clothed British Special Air Service (SAS) officers.
The IRA men parked a car believed to be containing a bomb near to a place where soldiers from the Royal Anglian Regiment usually assembled before the changing of their guard.
A ministerial statement issued after the killings claimed that, on parking the car, the three moved off toward the Spanish border where they were challenged by the security forces.
Here they behaved in such a way as to convince the ASS officers that their lives and those of others were under threat, hence the decision to fire.
Subsequently, Thames Television's current affairs programme,This Week , broadcast a feature, called ‘Death on the Rock’(ITV, 28 April 1988), in which witnesses came forward to cast doubt on the official version of events.
The Spanish police also maintained that they had kept the suspected terrorists' movements under close surveillance and maintained a constant flow of information on them to British officials in Gibraltar.
If true, this would have implied either that the police had knowingly allowed a car that they thought was full of explosives to drive into and around the island, or that they were aware throughout the operation that the car was not dangerous.
(Ewing and Gearty, 1990:237)
At the inquest on the killings, one of the witnesses interviewed on This Week retracted his evidence.
After initial indecision, the inquest jury delivered a verdict of lawful killing.
The British government saw this as a vindication both of the SAS killings and its own version of events.
However, two major civil and human rights organisations, the NCCL and Amnesty International, were critical of the way the inquest was conducted (ibid.:239–40).
Weitzer (1987) argues that the RUC is now trapped inside a ‘legitimacy vacuum’.
On the one hand, the force is immensely distrusted by large sections of the Catholic community who still see it as an ‘armed wing of unionism’, propping up an illegitimate regime.
Yet, on the other hand, the RUC now faces increasing hostility on the part of the Protestant population.
As recently as 1985, there had been signs of greater even-handedness on the part of the RUC, reflected in more frequent prosecutions of Protestants for ‘insurgency offences’.
A key catalyst of this development was the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in November 1985 which  awarded the Irish government a greater consultative role in Northern Irish affairs.
The signing of the agreement led to the immediate withdrawal, resignation, and subsequent reselection of fourteen Unionist MPs.
There then followed a General Strike in March 1986, which brought the province to a standstill, a series of sectarian killings and a succession of riotous demonstrations involving confrontation between Protestants and the RUC.
Ulster's Protestants look upon the RUC's changing role as a form of betrayal, a shocking revelation that it is not, after all, a ‘Protestant force’ dedicated to Loyalism.
On the contrary, ‘From their point of view the RUC is now being used as a political force to impose the Anglo-Irish Agreement on an unwilling majority in the province’(Weitzer, 1987:93).
Consequently, RUC officers have been subjected to public degradation ceremonies, and there have been threats and physical attacks on themselves and their families, forcing some of them to relocate.
Loyalist protesters have shouted ‘SS-RUC’ and ‘Dublin's lap dogs’, whilst some elected MPs have exhorted RUC men to resign or mutiny and warned them of the possible consequences of their ‘disloyalty’(ibid.).
The policing of Northern Ireland therefore stands at a tense crossroads.
DISCUSSION
The escalating conflict in Northern Ireland is not simply a function of deprivation and discrimination (Hewitt, 1981; Kovalcheck, 1987), but a political response to increasing state repression.
Recent research by White (1989) confirms that it was internment, in particular, which galvanised young, working-class Catholics into adopting political violence.
The introduction of this policy coincided with an upsurge in ‘terrorist’ activity (Brewer et al., 1988; Peroff and Hewitt, 1980).
There are important clues that, for the British police, ‘Northern Ireland has served as a valuable laboratory, offering important lessons for the control of labour protest and racial unrest at home — some ‘compensation’ for Britain's losses in the provinces' (Weitzer, 1985:41).
Hillyard (1985) perceives direct parallels between the behaviour of the legal authorities in Northern Ireland and techniques used in the 1984–5 coal dispute.
Aside from obvious similarities in police riot-control manoeuvres, there was a widespread tendency to use roadblocks, a systematic abuse of the statutory powers of arrest and overlaps in interrogation and intelligence methods.
As we shall see in Chapter 9, there are broad similarities between provisions embodied in the Northern Ireland emergency powers legislation and the British Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and the Public Order Act  1986.
Collectively, these statutes enable the police to stop and search suspects and ask for personal details, to enter forcibly and search private properties, to detain suspects for questioning for up to 72 hours and to use as much discretion as they require to impose bans or conditions on marches or assemblies.
Commenting on the provisions of the 1984 Act, Walsh envisages that:
They will produce a criminal law enforcement system for Britain which is very unlike that currently prevailing there, but very similar to that to which Northern Ireland has become accustomed.
It is not difficult to imagine the exercise of these powers in the inner city areas of Britain producing the same reaction as they provoke in the riot-tom areas of Belfast and Derry.
The next step will be to adopt more of the North's repressive emergency measures in order to contain the violence.
Bit by bit the ignorance of, and lack of respect for, civil liberties and human rights, prevalent for so long in Northern Ireland, will be transported to Britain.
(Walsh, 1984:345)
Walsh's concern for the future of civil liberties is undoubtedly well-founded, but his prediction that the experience of Belfast or Derry might soon be shared by other British inner-city areas may be unduly pessimistic.
The Irish Troubles are recent, but their political roots are centuries old.
While the grievances held by British blacks are undoubtedly profound, in many ways equivalent to those of Northern Ireland's Catholics, their political objectives are modest by comparison, certainly not extending to the  overthrowal of the state.
The continuing problems of Northern Ireland demonstrate the futility of responding to a deeply ingrained political problem with a law-and-order response.
As Weitzer maintains,
The police have been thrust into the resulting vacuum.
The solution is not to revert to Army control once again, but rather somehow to achieve a lasting political settlement that denies both insurgents and the paramilitary police their raison d'etre .
(Weitzer, 1985:53)
The key lesson of this case study is that order cannot be coercively imposed, and that some form of political consensus is necessary if escalation is to be avoided.
How to create a constitutional forum for political discussion involving, amongst others, the paramilitary organisations, is as yet an insoluble problem.
The refusal of successive Conservative governments under Margaret Thatcher and John Major to engage in dialogue  with the political supporters of paramilitarism makes it difficult to see how such an objective may be achieved.
(Talks instigated in April 1991 by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Brooke, brought together representatives of accredited Unionist and Nationalist parties, but excluded Sinn Fein, due to their unwillingness to denounce violence.)
For the moment, it remains inarguable that
any new constitutional arrangement must provide what the 1920 Government of Ireland Act tragically failed to achieve: tough guarantees of basic rights for the minority as well as for the majority community, together with accessible and representative institutions to enforce them.
(Hewitt, 1982:170)
Media representations of public disorder
Previous chapters have emphasised how the mass media may contribute indirectly to the potential for public disorder, first, by helping to create an ideological climate which justifies and encourages the use of repressive control tactics against dissenting groups; and second, by ‘sensitising’ the police and public to the possibility that disorder might occur.
In this chapter, we look in closer detail at the media's relationship to public disorder.
In particular, we consider such crucial questions as: what are the characteristic images and explanations of public disorder presented by the media, and why do they take their conventional form?
Do the media meet their own criteria of objectivity and balance in such representations, and do they reasonably address the underlying grievances of participants?
Are we correct to assume that media coverage helps to excuse or justify police aggression?
Does it encourage a ‘copycat’ effect, or generate the potential for further disorder in other, less obvious ways?
These issues are addressed in relation to media coverage of disorderly episodes referred to in earlier chapters.
Thus we look, in turn, at how particular examples of political dissent, urban riots, strike violence, football hooliganism and the conflict in Northern Ireland have been represented by the media.
Due to an apparently smaller American literature on this subject, discussion of US news coverage is solely confined to representations of the 1960s riots.
POLITICAL DISSENT
We begin by looking at examples of media coverage of disorderly political dissent, notably Halloran's and his co-workers' (1970) seminal study of the press and television reporting of the anti-Vietnam War march in London on 27 October 1968.
Based on research carried out by a team from  Leicester University, this study, and subsequent articles arising from it (e.g. Murdock, 1981), analysed the pre- and post-event media coverage.
Analysis of the pre-demonstration news coverage shows how the press and broadcast media referred obsessively to the potential for violence.
Detectives were said to have uncovered a plot by ‘militant extremists’ to use the march as a pretext for attacking buildings and police officers.
Violence was predicted on the basis of disorder at demonstrations in Paris and Chicago earlier in the year.
as if to support this prediction, some newspapers underlined that American and French students were planning to take part, and noted that certain organisers were not English and therefore ‘outside the consensus’(ibid.:210–11).
Far from treating the demonstration as a serious political event, the media portrayed the demonstration as little more than a ‘performance’, speculating about the possible fashion wear of the participants.
The protest was therefore emptied of serious political content.
Post-demonstration coverage also marginalised the political content, focusing, instead, on the activities of the violent minority.
This coverage was epitomised by a photograph of a demonstrator appearing to kick a policeman in the head, featured on the front pages of seven out of the ten newspapers analysed.
The preoccupation with violence was taken to absurd lengths in discussions of why disorder failed to reach its anticipated level.
Newspapers agreed that this was primarily due to the customary restraint of the British police and British demonstrators' traditional aversion to violence.
Halloran's and his co-workers' explanation of why the media coverage took this form emphasises the importance of news values.
News coverage is ‘event-oriented’ and therefore unconcerned with the political issues at state.
There is a need to make the news as intelligible as possible to the readership, hence the familiar notion of a militant conspiracy, and analogies with recent political events.
Finally, the commercial imperative to make media coverage as entertaining and marketable as possible ensures a priority on the dramatic, violent and spectacular.
The Leicester team noted how, despite the massive publicity the demonstration attracted, it was prevented from registering a significant political statement.
Sensing how this might have harmful repercussions, Halloran and co-workers asked: ‘How long will peaceful demonstrators seeking a new mode of expression be content to demonstrate peacefully when whatever they do is likely to get the negative treatment?’(ibid.:317).
Other studies suggest that media representations may sometimes be deliberately constructed to achieve a favourable impression of police violence against a politically ‘threatening’ group.
This was evident in press  coverage of the activities of women protesters outside the American air base at Greenham Common.
For example, on 12 December 1982, 35,000 women arrived to ‘Blockade the Base’.
On the first day of the blockade, policing was low-key.
But, on the second day, the police mounted a paramilitary-style operation to clear the entrance forcibly.
The Greenham women complained of police brutality but, as Johnson points out, ‘The press portrayed the blockading women as screaming harridans, contrasting us with what they had presented as the nice, well-meaning middle-class mothers and grandmothers the day before’(Johnson, 1989:167).
For the next 2 years, the press systematically attacked the women's political motives, their hygiene standards and their sexual identity (Young, 1990).
Then, on 11 December 1983, a large number of Greenham women attempted to pull down the perimeter fence.
Police intervention provoked allegations of brutality, but media coverage focused on the few police injuries, underemphasised the extent of police aggression and exaggerated the women's part in the violence.
Soldiers from the base struck at our hands with metal rods while Thames Valley police twisted and karate-chopped fingers and wrists, pulled us from the fence by our necks and flung us into ditches and trees.
Mounted police rode their horses straight into crowds of demonstrators.
When one woman tried to remove barbed wire from the path of a police horse she feared would get hurt, her photograph became the basis for a frenzied attack which ran the headline, ‘Horse Whipped With Barbed Wire’.
Police acknowledgement that this hadn't actually happened was delayed until after the press coverage.
Headlines screamed of this fabricated outrage and ignored the many injuries, including broken bones, that women had suffered.
Johnson, 1989:168)
THE AMERICAN RIOTS OF THE 1960s
American news coverage of the 1960s riots first came under academic scrutiny in the aftermath of the Watts riot, where it was generally felt that media reporting had exacerbated the conflict.
‘The media were accused of giving excessive publicity to the more intransigent blacks, of reporting inflammatory incidents, of provoking violence by their very presence, and, in one instance, of actually encouraging a rioter to throw a brick’(Paletz and Dunn, 1969:328).
Baker and Ball (1969:105–6) also believe that television pictures of the  riot conveyed helpful information about police movements to arsonists and looters, and blame some elements of the press for discriminating harmful and unsubstantiated rumour, e.g. that the rioting was orchestrated by muslims.
The most comprehensive study of US media coverage of the riots was carried out by the famous Kerner Commission (Kerner, 1968), which examined the style and content of television and newspaper reports for 1967.
The Commission found that the coverage of this period was generally calm, factual and restrained.
Far from emphasising violent confrontation and looting activity, both media focused on the steps being taken to quell the immediate rioting or the most effective ways of dealing with future disorder.
In a more critical vein, the Commission observed: ‘All media reported rumours that had no basis in fact.
Some newsmen staged riot events for the cameras’(ibid.:202).
The media, it felt, were over-dependent on ‘beleaguered government officials’ for estimates of the size and severity of the riots.
These estimates were invariably exaggerated.
While recognising that coverage of one riot tended to encourage rioting elsewhere (‘the principle of cumulative effect’), the Commission dismissed this as possible grounds for censorship:
Once a disturbance occurs, the word will spread independently of newspapers and television.
To attempt to ignore these events or portray them as something other than what they are can only diminish confidence in the media and increase the effectiveness of those who monger rumors and the fears of those who listen.
(Kerner, 1968:202)
The Kerner Commission also criticised the media for creating an impression that the riots were confrontations between black and white civilians, as opposed to attacks on white-owned property in Negro areas.
Coverage failed to highlight the wrongful arrests of blacks or excessive use of force by the police; nor did it adequately convey the extent of pro-social activity engaged in by black ‘counter-rioters’, such as helping the wounded or assisting the emergency services.
There was no serious attempt to examine the rioters' underlying grievances — seen as a symptom of the media's customary neglect of the social problems experienced by black Americans.
Black respondents interviewed as part of the investigation ‘noted a pronounced discrepancy between what they saw in the riots and what television broadcast’(ibid.:207).
The media were widely distrusted as agents of the white power  structure, too willing to accept the accounts of white officials in preference to accredited black representatives.
Similar themes have subsequently been explored by other American researchers.
Knopf (1975) objects to the way that the press often used rumour and innuendo as the basis of ‘hard reporting’.
She refers, for example, to an issue of the Baltimore Sun which showed a picture of an unidentified motorcyclist, a gun strapped to his back.
The caption read: ‘QUIET, BUT….
An unidentified motorcycle rider, armed with a rifle and carrying a belt of ammunition, was among those in the heart of York, Pa., Negro district late last night.
The area was quiet for the first time in six days’(Knopf, 1975:257).
The obvious implication was that the individual was a dangerous sniper when, in reality, he was a 16-year-old boy off hunting groundhogs.
Knopf is also critical of the media's tendency to characterise disorders as ‘meaningless, purposeless, senseless (and) irrational’.
Referring to press coverage of riots following the death of Dr Martin Luther King, Jnr in 1968, she observes that,
No attempt is made to place the violence in a social context.
The reference to the assassination of Dr King is perfunctory, with only a passing mention of his funeral and a few shouts about his death.
Value-laden words receive unusual emphasis.
The participants are ‘marauders’, not men; they ‘rove’ instead of run; they move in ‘gangs’, not groups; they engage in ‘vandalism’, not simply violence.
(Knopf, 1975:262)
Singer (1970) explored the argument that television coverage encourages subsequent riot participation.
He asked 499 people arrested during the Detroit riot of 1967 to recall how they had reacted to television pictures of previous US riots.
Almost half the respondents said they experienced feelings of disapproval, sadness or disgust; only 26 per cent had felt anger or resentment towards the white authorities or pleasure that rioting was taking place.
Singer then asked respondents to say how they first heard about the Detroit riot, and what details they were initially given.
He discovered that 48 per cent of them first heard about the riot from another person, 27 per cent by direct observation and only 26 per cent from media coverage.
The information received typically referred only to the riot's location, and not specific incidents.
These findings suggest that media coverage did not play an influential role in encouraging people to participate in the Detroit riot.
A case study reported by Paletz and his co-workers (Paletz and Dunn, 1969; Paletz and Entman, 1981) emphasises that not all American newspapers  were guilty of sensationalist reporting.
Some, like the Winston-Salem Journal , were deliberately restrained.
While other local newspapers produced exaggerated and error-ridden coverage of a small North Carolina riot, the Journal was careful to define the precise location of the riot, and reassure its readers that most of the city remained unaffected.
All rumours were thoroughly checked and omitted if unverified.
In attempting to defuse possible inter-racial antagonism, the Journal rarely mentioned that most of the 500 rioters were black.
‘The paper did not, of course, blur the issue completely; it was perfectly clear that most of the rioters were Negroes.
But the Journal stressed that those involved were ‘hoodlums’, atypical of the Winston-Salem Negro' (Paletz and Dunn, 1969:337).
The Journal's editorial policy pre-dates the codes of conduct subsequently adopted by many American radio and television stations (Kueneman and Wright, 1975).
However, Paletz and his colleagues remain critical of the journalists' over-reliance on official sources of information about the riot (i.e. the mayor and chief of police) which helped to frame the event as the successful police suppression of a naked spree of lawlessness.
There was no attempt to empathise with the rioters or to communicate their grievances.
Indeed, ‘by handling the event as a police-crime story, not a political one’, the Journal's coverage ‘probably reduced the political power of already inefficacious poor people’(Paletz and Entman, 1981:117).
THE BRITISH RIOTS OF THE 1980s
Tumber's (1982) analysis of television news coverage of the British inner-city riots of 1981 reveals many similarities with corresponding American coverage of the 1960s.
A content analysis of BBC and ITV broadcasts between 4 and 16 July showed that ‘Riot Equipment’ was the most frequently referred-to theme of the news broadcasts.
A rank ordering of the thirty-four most popular themes revealed that ‘Rioters’ destruction of property', ‘Causes’, ‘Looting, theft’, ‘Race’and ‘Rioters’violence against people' were the next most-common items.
‘Police violence’ was recorded in thirty-fourth place, being referred to only once.
Interviews with riot participants indicated bitterness at the media's failure to highlight prior police-community relations: ‘They do not show people being stopped and searched in their cars, in their homes and whilst waiting at bus stops’, one interviewee complained.
‘Nothing has been shown about what was going in Brixton before April.
The public did not, therefore, understand what was going on or why there was trouble’(ibid.:13).
Tumber generally praised media personnel for adopting a responsible  attitude in their reporting.
Occasionally, these standards lapsed, as when an ITV News At Ten headline asked, ‘Was Someone Directing The Riots?’, a piece of pure speculation based (like Knopfs Baltimore example) on a brief clip of an unidentified motor scooter rider and passenger.
Senior police officers and media professionals interviewed by Tumber felt that broadcast pictures of violence, looting and destruction in progress helped prevent the dissemination of dangerous or malicious rumour.
Both the police and rioters agreed that rioting was not encouraged by the ‘advertising’ effect of television pictures.
‘The speed with which some of the incidents flared up suggests, in fact, that the kids were not sitting indoors, but that they were already out there on the streets — often bored, resentful and waiting for trouble’(ibid.:46).
An interesting contrast has been observed in the way that separate British riots were reported.
In commenting on the media coverage of the Brixton riot of April 1981, Gordon and Rosenburg (1989:18) point out that ‘the editorial responses of most papers as distinct from their news coverage, while condemning the violence, seemed to show some awareness of the underlying causes of the rioting’.
However, when the Toxteth disturbance took place only 3 months later, the media response was couched, almost universally, in a ‘law and order’ rhetoric, emphasising the wantonness and criminality of the violence, and demanding coercive measures to deal with it (Sumner, 1982).
Murdock (1984:78) accounts for the general character of press and television coverage of the Toxteth riot in terms of‘the routine business of news production and the practical and commercial pressures which shape it’.
Thus priority is given to the statements of senior police and politicians, partly because they are more readily available and willing to be contacted than rioters or their grass-roots representatives; and partly because they are more able to deliver quotable material — an invaluable resource when strict deadlines must be met.
Similarly, for safety's sake, photographers are obliged to stand behind police lines.
Hence the impression given is of a ‘thin blue line’ being attacked by a vicious and threatening mob.
As with coverage of political events, there is a need to ensure intelligibility (which is achieved by evoking stereotypical explanations, such as the role of agitators or ‘hooligan youth’) and excitement (hence the fixation on the dramatic and spectacular).
However, Murdock's account does not explain the variation in the reporting of the Brixton and Toxteth riots referred to above.
Wren-Lewis's (1981/1982) analysis of television news coverage of these riots enables us to understand this contrast.
He points out that the reporting of the Brixton riot was marked by a discursive struggle between the  ‘law-and-order discourse’ and a ‘contra-discourse’, which sought to demystify ‘the hitherto unproblematic position of the police’, by emphasising the possibility that police harassment and brutality lay at the root of the disorder.
Subsequent riots were represented almost unequivocally in terms of the ‘law and order discourse’.
Wren-Lewes explains that this was because, as successive riots occurred, television's preference for scenes of violence and destruction created an impression of unyielding crisis and chaos.
There was simply not the time or space to enter into the detailed sort of discussion which accompanied the Brixton riot.
In addition, the progressively violent and pandemonious reality suggested by television's own reports created the very conditions in which a law-and-order rhetoric could flourish virtually unchallenged.
Once established in this way, the law-and-order discourse acquired a lasting pre-eminence.
By the mid-1980s, rioting, like the Handsworth and Broadwater Farm disorders of 1985, was being reported as a manifestation of ‘criminality, pure and simple’(Gordon and Rosenburg, 1989:20).
Some national newspapers portrayed the Handsworth riot as an inter-racial conflict, with Afro-Caribbean youths supposedly attacking both whites and Asians.
These reports suppressed the fact that more whites than blacks were arrested during the disturbance, and hardly mentioned that police-community relations had recently deteriorated.
The notion of outside agitators (including Libyan agents provocateurs ) was prevalent in reports of the Broadwater Farm disorder (Benyon and Solomos, 1987).
Coverage of this riot made no serious attempt to identify its underlying causes (ibid.).
MASS PICKETING: THE ‘BATTLE OF ORGREAVE’
In turning to media representations of industrial confrontation, we focus, once again, on the 1984–5 coal dispute.
Green is one of several authors who maintain that media coverage of the strike attempted to denigrate and undermine the miners’ case against the government.
The vilification of Arthur Scargill, the unbalanced emphasis on picket-line violence and intimidation, the failure to explain issues at the heart of the strike, the criminalization of striking miners, the unquestioned assumptions of police neutrality and the fundamental contradiction between the reality experienced by striking communities and the distorted presentation of that reality through the mass media — these  were the key components of the media's ideological policing of the strike.
(Green, 1990:157)
Part of this ‘ideological policing’ involved the use of particular forms of imagery and discourse to condemn the use of violence by the strikers while justifying police aggression.
This section demonstrates how, in its choice of language, film-editing techniques and subtle juxtaposition of images and commentary, television news delivered an entirely misleading and politically biased representation of the Battle of Orgreave on 18 June 1984.
The following discussion draws on analysis of the BBC 1 Nine O'Clock News and ITN's News At Ten bulletins by Cumberbatch et al (1986), Jones (1991) and Masterman (1985).
The discussion focuses primarily on Jones's study of how the two main channels described first the instigation, then the escalation of the disorder.
A final subsection consolidates the analysis by emphasising a number of points raised by the other authors.
The instigation of disorder
The BBC's Nine O'Clock News was obviously the first to describe the episode.
According to its narrator, John Thorne,
The strikers' blockade of Orgreave was a precisely planned operation, but the police responded, sending in riot squad reinforcements to match the 5,000 or more pickets, and that was the trigger for some of the worst violence of this lengthy dispute.
It reached a peak as miners surged in against the riot shields.
Policemen hit out with truncheons under a barrage of stones and missiles.
Mass picketing had turned to rioting.
The police didn't give any ground and on the front line they handed out as much physical punishment as they received.
Eventually, the senior officer ordered in the mounted police.
Thorne's report establishes that it was the miners who ‘called’ the confrontation.
Theirs, we are told, was ‘a precisely planned operation’.
The police merely ‘responded’ to this challenge, ‘matching’the picket numbers.
The commentary clearly implies that the police aggression was justified: ‘hitting out’ with truncheons is excusable, given the ‘barrage of stones and missiles’they were subjected to.
That the police ‘didn't give any ground’ suggests controlled restraint, while the disclosure that they ‘handed out as much physical punishment as they received’indicates that they did not use excessive force.
The reference to ‘Eventually’ in the last sentence implies  that it was only after a commendable period of restraint that horses were ordered in.
The ITN coverage of this phase differed in several key respects.
Their news reporter, Phil Roman, began by explaining how,
As the last of the lorries went in, the trouble started.
Pickets charged straight into the police riot shields.
In seconds, a pack of police, twenty deep, was fighting a shower of stones to hold the pickets back.
The first cavalry charge came a few minutes later and it clearly worried the pickets.
(Film shows pickets scattering across field.)
Where the BBC commentary suggests that the ‘mere presence’ of police officers was the trigger for the violence, Roman acknowledges that the arrival of the lorries — not naked hostility towards the police — was the pretext for disorder.
In this way, the miners' action appears less vindictive.
However, the ITN account emphasises that the decision to introduce the police horses was not taken lightly, but as the result of accumulating pressure (‘police, twenty deep…fighting a shower of stones’).
Finally, in a classic piece of understatement, viewers are informed that the cavalry charge ‘clearly worried the pickets’.
The escalation of disorder
The BBC offered the following account of how the confrontation developed:
A gap opened in the ranks and the horses galloped in.
The horses are the most feared weapon in the police armoury on the picket line and they are very effective.
But it's the riot squads that follow up to make the arrests and today, on the fields of battle around Orgreave, the police were involved in some of the most vicious hand-to-hand fighting of the entire miners' dispute.
(Film sequence of two policemen swinging at, though apparently not hitting, pickets; picket taking a flying kick at a policeman.)
The attacks on policemen were horrific but the riot squads gave no quarter, using their batons liberally.
It was a miracle no-one was killed, said one police commander.
At all times, the police were in control and there were over one hundred arrests as the fighting ebbed and flowed.
There is a marked contrast here between the description of violence by the pickets (‘The attacks on policemen were horrific’) and corresponding police aggression (they ‘gave no quarter’; they were ‘in control at all times’).
The linguistic transformation known as object deletion is used to ensure that  instances of police aggression are rendered more palatable.
Thus we are told that ‘horses galloped in, but not who they were attacking; and though the police ‘used their batons liberally’, it is not revealed who they were used against.
In each case, the object of the police action has been intentionally deleted.
A number of euphemisms also help to underemphasise the severity of police violence.
The revelation that they ‘gave no quarter’ helps to soften the fact that the police were beating people with their truncheons.
References to the fact that the horses were ‘very effective’ or that the police ‘used their batons liberally’further disguise the extent of police aggression.
Finally, the simple assertion that the fighting ‘ebbed and flowed’ creates a misleading impression that it was a fair and equal contest.
ITN's commentary unfolded thus:
More police reinforcements — this time taking advantage of the confusion caused by the police horses.
As the horses came back, pickets threw half-bricks at them.
Then they started on the front line of police.
Some of the pickets had wrenched riot shields away from the police.
When they started to gather for another push, the second wave of mounted police went in, scattering the pickets right across the field.
Tension built up.
The Assistant Chief Constable warned the pickets to stop throwing missiles and disperse.
They didn't.
More reinforcements — this time with short shields and truncheons.
After two hours, the police were tired of being pushed and pelted with house bricks.
The pickets knew what to expect: they'd been warned it could turn nasty, and it did.
(Film sequence of riot police following horses in pursuit of miners; policeman repeatedly striking crouching picket about the head; miner taking flying kick at same policeman; officer hitting different picket on head with baton as he is leading him behind police lines.)
Here there is a greater emphasis on the police violence.
The ITN sequence of film shows a close-up shot of a miner being systematically beaten about the head by a policeman which, as we shall see later, was deliberately excluded from the BBC version.
Nevertheless, the unmistakable impression created is that the police violence was justified: they were ‘tired of being pushed and pelted with house bricks’ for 2 hours.
Euphemistic references to police aggression are also apparent in the ITN account, as in ‘it could turn nasty, and it did’, where the agent and object of the violence (i.e. who did what to whom) remain unspecified.
Other instances of police violence (e.g. the batoning incident) are not accompanied by spoken commentary, as if the reporter is reluctant to condemn such action.
The ITN version suggests that the pickets are still largely to  blame for the violence, but the police contribution to disorder is given more emphasis than in the BBC's bulletin.
Other points
Jones concentrated her analysis only on the late-evening news broadcasts.
A complementary study by Masterman (1985) demonstrates that the BBC 9 o'clock news coverage had been modified since earlier evening bulletins due to a ‘crisis of credibility’ between its earlier 6 o'clock news broadcast and corresponding ITV accounts.
Masterman's systematic comparison of the two narratives indicates how some aspects of commentary were modified to reduce evidence of bias revealed by comparisons with ITN's almost simultaneous broadcast.
However, these modifications were only superficial.
‘Though additional references to aggressive police tactics had been woven into the text, there was no explicit condemnation (or even mild disapproval) of police action, and no acknowledgement that unnecessary police violence was the central issue at stake’(ibid.:106).
The BBC had edited out at least one police atrocity.
As we saw earlier, ITN coverage showed an incident in which one miner took a flying kick at a policeman who was beating a fellow-picket around the head.
The BBC coverage excludes the truncheon blow, but includes the flying kick:
Close comparison of BBC and ITN footage shows that the BBC film has in shot the man who was most severely beaten by the police, but that the film has been cut at precisely the point when the policeman begins to set about him with his truncheon .
What we cut away to are miners' retaliatory attempts to help their colleagues.
But because the BBC film has not shown any examples of police violence, these de-contextualised images can only signify unprovoked violence by pickets.
(Masterman, 1985:103, emphasis in original)
A further indictment of editing practice was provided by BBC 2's Brass Tacks programme of 30 November 1985.
This programme included extracts from the police's own video of the day's events.
The video clearly emphasised that the heightening of tension and resulting hostility was caused, not by stone throwing as the news media suggested, but by the tactical introduction of the mounted police (Cumberbatch et al., 1986).
These examples lend weight to Masterman's assertion that ‘news presentation is an ideological construction, rather than a matter of unproblematic reporting’(Masterman, 1985:106).
Television news personnel feel duty-bound, in times of social and political crisis, to project a pro-establishment view of industrial conflict.
In Masterman's view, the Battle  of Orgreave stands as a salutary reminder that ‘what is omitted from television's agenda cannot easily enter the general consciousness and that the control of information, whether it takes a brutal or sophisticated form, is the very cornerstone of political power’(ibid.:108).
FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM
British and Canadian press responses to the Heysel Stadium tragedy are considered by Young (1986), who notes how newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic ran the story for a whole month, dwarfing coverage of the Bangladesh cyclone which resulted in many thousands of deaths.
Young maintains that, ‘As horrendous as the results of Heysel were, the lurid impact- and circulation-oriented headlines suggested an event much worse’(ibid.:260).
‘The Killing Field’ was the macabre headline chosen by three newspapers.
The most frequently cited media explanations for the Heysel disturbance were the influence of alcohol, the involvement of the National Front, the ineptitude or cowardliness of the Belgian security forces and the hooligan mentality of the Liverpool supporters.
This final category of explanation typically included references to the irrational, bestial and militaristic behaviour of the British fans.
There was no counterbalancing emphasis on the aggressive and provocative activities of the rival Juventus supporters (which were apparent in the live television coverage of the game), or the fact that there were confrontations between Belgian police and Italian supporters prior to the game.
The references to the bestiality and irrationality of the Liverpool supporters are typical of the themes used by sports reporters to systematically denigrate football hooligans.
Whannel (1979) identifies four such themes which commonly depict the hooligans as: ‘mindless/senseless’, ‘maniacs/lunatics’, ‘foul/sub-human’ and a ‘minority/so-called supporters’.
Whannel believes that the main reason why this terminology has taken such an enduring grip is that it is being used to serve the commercial interests of Football League and club officials as part of a hidden agenda to attract a new type of football audience (the ‘family audience’) and thereby solve the game's economic crisis.
According to this perspective, the demand for all-seater stadia and accompanying leisure and commercial facilities — ceaselessly promulgated as a method of curbing hooliganism is part of a thinly veiled plan to replace soccer's traditional working-class audience with middle-class consumers.
According to a similar perspective, adopted by authors like Hall (1978) and Taylor (1987), the growing media focus on hooliganism since the  1960s may be seen as a political device to help justify a more authoritarian state response to all forms of social dissidence.
Lloyd (1989:261) takes a similar position.
She argues that, before the Public Order Act 1986 was passed, ‘it was the moral panic surrounding football hooliganism which the government used in its publicity for the new law.
The opposition vainly argued that football violence could not be lumped together with political unrest and industrial disputes’.
NORTHERN IRELAND
The media's political role is especially ubiquitous in their reporting of Northern Ireland.
Before the Army became involved, media accounts often referred to the political background to the conflict and were sympathetic towards the Civil Rights movement (Hillyard, 1982).
By 1975, this had all changed: reports, features and editorials now concentrated on protecting the Army's image and portraying the IRA as ‘criminals or mindless psychopaths often manipulated by Godfathers behind the scenes’(ibid.:39).
In addition to banning, delaying or censoring news and current affairs reports (ibid.), the British government and military officials have used a variety of sanctions, notably cutting journalists off from authoritative sources of information, to ensure that recalcitrant individuals and institutions are brought back into line (Aleut, 1978:153).
In practice, such measures are seldom necessary: most journalists seem aware of their tacit responsibility to toe the approved ideological line (Schlesinger, 1978:225).
The way that these forms of social control can be mobilised is illustrated by newspaper coverage of the events of Bloody Sunday, 30 January 1972 (see Chapter 5).
According to Curtis, ‘the British media fudged the events, suppressed investigations and  blazened forth the idea that the British army had been ‘cleared’ of guilt’(Curtis, 1984:40).
Eye-witness accounts by British journalists told of the unprovoked and apparently indiscriminate shooting of civilians by British soldiers.
According to Simon Winchester of The Guardian ,
Paratroopers piled out of their vehicles, many ran forward to make arrests, but others rushed to the street corners.
It was these men, perhaps 20 in all, who opened fire with their rifles.
I saw three men fall to the ground.
One was still obviously alive, with blood pumping from his leg.
The others, both apparently in their teens, seemed dead….
Then people could be seen moving forward in Fahan Street, their  hands above their heads.
One man was carrying a white handkerchief.
Gunfire was directed even at them and they fled or fell to the ground.
(quoted in Curtis, 1984:40)
The Times reporter also quoted a British General urging his men to ‘Go on the paras, go and get them’, and said that the lower ranks appeared to him to be relishing their work and perceiving the Bogsiders as ‘legitimate targets’(ibid.:41).
But there was no general media outcry.
The Times and Guardian reports contrasted with those of other papers.
Timely interventions by senior Army officers had already established the ‘official view’ that the paratroops had fired only at clearly identifiable targets, and only when they came under heavy fire from gunmen, and nail and petrol bombers (Curtis, 1984:41–2).
Despite the evidence to the contrary, most of Monday morning's newspapers subscribed to the Army's version.
Even the Guardian's own headline seemed reluctant to blame the soldiers: ‘13 killed as paratroops break riot: ‘Soldiers were returning Derry sniper fire,’ says Army' (ibid.:43), and the paper's editorial distanced itself from Winchester's account:
As yet it is too soon to be sure of what happened.
The army has an intolerably difficult task in Ireland.
At times it is bound to act firmly, even severely.
Whether individual soldiers misjudged their situation yesterday, or were themselves too directly threatened, cannot yet be known.
(Curtis, 1984:44)
The authorities' ‘second diversionary thrust’ involved the setting up of a Tribunal of Inquiry under Lord Widgery.
This move hindered subsequent investigation into Bloody Sunday and nullified further criticism of the Army — largely because the government's Press Office appealed for the suspension of any media coverage which might prejudice the Tribunal's findings.
This, and a veiled threat of prosecution, was enough to deter the publication of a Sunday Times article and the broadcasting of a Thames Television programme which were both detrimental to the Army's case.
The Widgery Report was published in April.
Though critical of the fact that four civilians had been shot dead without conceivable justification, the document generally endorsed the Army's version of events and, in the press view, completely exonerated the paratroops (Curtis, 1984:50).
In the autumn of 1988, the British government made its most overt attempt to date to silence its Republican opponents.
On 19 October 1988, the then Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, issued notices to the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) and BBC, requiring them, under the Broadcasting  Act 1981, to refrain from broadcasting any words spoken on behalf of, or in support of , a ‘proscribed organisation’, excluding anything said in the course of parliamentary proceedings, or in the run up to a parliamentary, European parliamentary or local election.
The government justified the imposition of this censorship on the grounds that the appearance on television of ‘supporters of violence’ might frighten offend, or provide sustenance and support for terrorists themselves.
Ewing and Gearty are not impressed by such reasons.
They argue that it is misguided to pretend that these proscribed organisations (like Sinn Fein) either do not exist or do not carry massive popular support.
Rather than face up to the horrendous alienation implied by such strong electoral support for Sinn Fein, the Government has closed its eyes and now compels the population to do the same.
Such blindness distorts truth; such political irresponsibility stores up trouble for the future.
(Ewing and Gearty, 1990:246)
DISCUSSION
The role of the media in public disorder has been found to be consistent across different historical periods, geographical locations and types of disorder.
An ideal type of their operation is offered in Figure 8.1.
An important caveat to such generalisations is that the category of the ‘mass media’ contains a variety of means and forms of communication.
The treatment of public disorder in a serious documentary on a public television service is likely to have different preoccupations from the main news bulletin on the same channel.
Newspapers, in turn, differ considerably in layout, audience and political slant.
Nevertheless, analyses of media coverage of disorder have consistently found more similarities than differences in media coverage.
Thus the processes identified in the diagram will be evident in the majority of media outlets, the exceptions being few and far between.
To describe how the media cover disorder is not in itself an explanation of why they should adopt this approach.
Those who regard the media as little more than an arm of the capitalist state (Miliband, 1969) will be content with a structural or conspiratorial explanation, emphasising the institutional dependence and ideological role of the media.
Cohen and Young (1981) call this the ‘manipulative model’ and rightly insist that the problem of explanation is more complicated.
Broadly speaking, we can identify four sets of pressures which serve to disable the media from meeting their own criteria of objectivity and balance   in the coverage of public disorder.
The first set consists of institutional and professional definitions of what constitutes news.
As the classic formulation of Galtung and Ruge (1981) demonstrates, news is a cultural construct.
It must fit the institutional demands for the production of news on a regular cycle within predetermined categories and established formats.
Thus lead news stories are concerned with the immediate and dramatic, with effects  rather than causes, with surface appearances rather than underlying processes.
The operation of news values constitutes the second set of pressures.
Topics and events are selected as headline news according to their newsworthiness.
Hence the emphasis on the dramatic, unexpected and negative, the measurement of the significance of negative events in terms of damage to people and property.
Here, too, are sedimented conventions of presentation: the need to personalise the issue by interviewing hapless victims, to make comparisons with other events classified as similar in kind and, most obviously in the case of television, to be attracted to that which can be pictured and distracted from that which cannot.
All this drives the media towards a largely predictable way of selecting and presenting events: what Tuchman (1974) has called ‘routinising the unexpected’.
Another aspect of routinisation reveals a third set of factors: the need for authoritative opinion.
In a constitutional democracy, there are individuals whose status or office gives them the automatic right to be heard.
Though other accounts may be sought and presented, those in authority occupy a privileged position in what has been called the ‘hierarchy of credibility’(Becker, 1972).
They occupy the role of primary definers (Hall et al , 1978) whose interpretation of events immediately sets the agenda within which alternative versions must be cast.
Thus the reactions of politicians, police and employers have a different weight to those of demonstrators, rioters or strikers.
Thus, by virtue of institutional demands, occupational conventions and perceived political legitimacy, the media as a whole are predisposed to adopt a style of coverage which will pay scant regard to analysis of the causes of protest or the grievances of protesters.
Where there is room for manoeuvre is in the way the media seek to locate the political significance of disorderly protest.
Here the media enter into a directly ideological role, since they are explaining to us what these events mean.
This need to ‘define the situation’ is the fourth set of pressures.
At its most rampant in the conservative popular press, the view is likely to be taken that the protesters — the violent minority by their acts, the majority by their association — have moved outside the realm of politics and into the area of criminal activity.
More sophisticated versions argue or imply that there can be no excuse for their actions, that they have lost whatever case they had by their conduct.
More crudely, they are written off as a rampaging mob, victim to primitive urges or the machinations of conspirators.
At this point, dehumanising language is evoked and inhuman measures of repression advocated.
Not all the media choose or are able to indulge in such ideological vilification.
Laws and conventions constrain the broadcast media, who may  nevertheless reproduce the voices of those who can adopt such a stance.
Especially in times of political crisis, the need to delegitimate the form of protest and thus the cause itself may lead the media to slant its coverage towards a version which justifies its own ideological view.
Hence the police are assumed to be in the right, capable only of restrained reaction to provocation.
If need be, the words and pictures of reporters can be adjusted to fit this version of events.
Only at this point is a conspiratorial interpretation of the role of the media justified.
Since, as we have argued, disorder is frequently motivated by the failure to find any other effective voice, media coverage merely perpetuates the problem.
By condemning the disorderly symptoms of social conflict and neglecting its causes, the media implicitly endorse further repressive measures.
This exacerbates the possibility of further disorder as more protest is aroused by the loss of civil liberties.
Too many contemporary social problems are conveniently attributed to the media but, in the case of public disorder, some blame is clearly justified.
Contemporary policing and its democratic control
Since the inner-city disturbances of 1981, public order policing in Britain has become discernibly more authoritarian and paramilitarised (Jefferson, 1990; Uglow, 1988).
This chapter considers these developments, arguing that they have an obvious potential to amplify, rather than reduce, the tendency to public disorder, and assessing their implications for the erosion of civil liberties.
The chapter begins by analysing changes which have occurred in the American style of policing since their riots of the 1960s.
This overview, culminating in a recent case study of American police practices, offers a reasonable basis for predicting future British trends.
A second section then analyses the corresponding drift towards a more repressive style of policing in this country.
It also examines a recent case study of a British police operation which exemplifies current trends.
The third section moves on to investigate the nature and effectiveness of British and American mechanisms for exercising democratic control over the police (i.e. influencing their policies and making them answerable for their behaviour).
Three such mechanisms are evaluated: community policing arrangements, police complaints procedures and formal systems of accountability.
AMERICAN POLICING TRENDS
General developments
We begin by examining American policing trends over the last 25 years.
Fearful of any repetition of the urban riots, the American government took several measures in the late 1960s to strengthen its control capabilities.
According to Button (1989:297), it was the Detroit riot of July 1967 which ‘marked a turning point in federal policy towards local law enforcement  because this upheaval clearly demonstrated the inability of local and state forces to contain disorders’.
Prior to this riot, the Johnson administration's strategy had been to try and eradicate the possibility of further disorder by tackling the chronic social problems highlighted by the riots.
One of its key policies was to activate an improvement of police-black relations.
A series of conferences were staged for local officials and police personnel from America's 136 largest cities.
The Justice Department's Community Relations Service was enlarged to co-ordinate federal programmes aimed at reducing inner-city social problems.
With the continuation of the disorders into 1968, the administration shifted its emphasis — to that of riot control.
New legislation was enacted in the form of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act 1968, which established a national police-training centre and provided financial assistance to local police forces to strengthen their riot control capabilities.
Most US cities upgraded their riot technology, invested more in training and developed contingency plans for dealing with major disorder.
Special ‘riot squads’ emerged throughout the USA.
By 1968, 15,000 men had been trained for handling civil disorder.
The US military and intelligence agencies were correspondingly expanded.
The greater emphasis on law-enforcement techniques pushed American urban conflict towards a new phase of ‘political or conspiratorial violence’(Janowitz, 1969:332).
Between 1968 and 1970, there were numerous violent incidents involving shootouts between the police and members of the Black Panthers organisation.
Subsequently, another radical organisation, the Black Liberation Army (BLA) adopted such tactics as ambushing police in the ghetto and bombing police stations.
It was during this phase of conflict between the police and black radicals that,
With more than 1,000 plainclothes agents, the army gathered information on approximately 18,000 American civilians between 1967 and 1969 in its efforts to assemble data for city and other public agencies preparing for domestic upheaval.
Shortly after the election of Richard Nixon to the presidency, and his appointment of a ‘law and order’ attorney general, the FBI was authorized to engage in electronic surveillance of, and to direct counterintelligence activities toward, black militants and their organizations as way of preventing ghetto violence.
(Button, 1989:298)
These, and other militaristic tactics, hastened the decline of organisations like the Panthers and BLA.
Twenty-four black militant organisations were subjected to ‘tax surveillance’ as part of International Revenue Service  (IRS) harassment, and FBI agents placed bogus documents into the hands of Panther members which led them to suspect each other of being police informants (McAdam and Moore, 1989:281).
The monitoring of political dissidents was routine during the 1960s (Brodeur, 1983).
Sophisticated surveillance techniques were used to control crowds at the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention (see Chapter 2).
Here police monitoring of the large crowds was facilitated by ‘sophisticated radio equipment supplied by the Army, hot lines to the White House and the Pentagon, and an 8 by 12-foot map of the city, complete with a zoom-lens television camera for closeups, that could show where every police officer and other security force was located at all times’(Farber, 1988:159).
This type of technology now exists in all major American cities.
Many city-centre streets are monitored by 24-hour surveillance cameras capable of ‘seeing’ through apartment windows.
New York City has a computerised riot control room which uses closed-circuit television cameras to relay detailed information about the movement of riot participants (Manwaring-White, 1983:90–1).
The police capacity to respond to public disorder has greatly improved since the riots.
The National Guard is still available on a standby basis.
Organised at state level, the Guard is composed of part-timers who undergo a statutory period of training with the regular Army.
During the riots, the Guard was criticised for being panicky and uncoordinated (Brewer et al , 1988:117).
Now it has been rendered virtually obsolete by the introduction of quasi-military squads of police officers known as SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) units.
Such units are specially trained and equipped to deal with a variety of situations, like bomb disposal, undercover surveillance, releasing hostages, riots and disasters.
Consisting of permanent teams of officers, SWAT units and other similar agencies now exist throughout the USA.
For example, Massachusetts has its own STOP (Special Tactics and Operations Unit).
Since the 1980 Miami riot, the Metro Dade Police Department has deployed a specialist ‘field force’ in response to public disorder.
Consisting of a platoon of police officers and sergeants, led by a lieutenant, the ‘field force’ is formed by six squads — one sergeant and seven officers per squad.
The remainder form the Commander's executive squad; provide for specialized ‘chemical agent’ responses; man a ‘prison wagon’; and provide vehicle security.
(McKenzie and Gallagher, 1989:169)
Squad members are equipped with body armour, jump suits, shotguns, smoke  canisters , chemical agent launchers and CS gas.
They are specially  trained in crowd-control techniques and were effective in suppressing outbreaks of disorder in the early 1980s (ibid.).
A case study: operation ‘Hammer’
A heavily militarised style of policing has been deployed recently as part of a moral panic surrounding youth gang violence connected to the trafficking of rock cocaine (‘crack’) in the Watts area of Los Angeles.
Here the ‘virtual extinction’ of job opportunities for young black males, and competition with immigrant workers in the employment sector allied to discriminatory attitudes among employees, has ‘incubated [a]counter-economy of youth crime and drug dealing’(Davis, 1988:49).
It was the accidental shooting of a woman outside a theatre in an affluent part of the city which initially generated a media and political outcry.
Black community representatives in Watts were among those calling for a decisive police response.
The LAPD chief, Daryl Gates, responded to this outcry by authorising a series of ‘anti-gang sweeps’, known as the Gang Related Active Trafficker Suppression programme (GRATS).
Nine sweeps, each involving three hundred officers, were carried out in February and March 1988.
These resulted in 1,500 arrests and the impounding of 500 cars.
However, on Good Friday, gang members shot randomly into a street-corner crowd in South Central, killing a 19-year-old woman, and operation ‘Hammer’ was mobilised to finally snuff out the problem.
In the space of one single weekend, elite tactical squads, joined by a special anti-drug taskforce and 1,000 extra-duty officers, rounded up scores of Watts teenagers.
Kids were humiliatingly forced to ‘kiss the sidewalk’ or spreadeagle against police cruisers while officers checked their names against computerized files of gang members.
1,453 were arrested and processed in mobile booking offices, mostly for petty offences like delinquent traffic tickets or curfew violations.
Hundreds more, uncharged, had their names entered on the LAPD gang roster for future surveillance.
(Davis, 1988:37)
As Davis points out, these tactics and the lack of public opposition to them, have ominous implications for the future of civil liberties:
Those who applaud the Hammer as a necessary evil today will be urging some form of youth internment as a necessary evil tomorrow.
The logic of civil libertarians has never been more compelling: the rights taken away from gang members will be rights denied all minority youth; the  walls put around gangs will imprison whole communities; the police state once expanded will not easily be contracted.
(Davis, 1988:59)
BRITISH POLICING TRENDS
As in America, important developments have occurred in the following areas of public order policing: public surveillance, crowd-control training and technology and the extension of legal powers.
These changes are separately analysed.
Public surveillance
Finch (1989:290–1) asserts that there has been a progressive growth in the routine surveillance of political ‘subversives’ over the past decade.
In her view, techniques developed in Northern Ireland have become more apparent on the British mainland.
Policing at all levels now recognises the need to accumulate and maintain ‘low-level intelligence’ which may be used to anticipate or pre-empt disorder.
Finch points out that the job description of some Scottish police officers requires them to enlist the co-operation of at least one person in every street who is willing and able to pass on useful information.
According to her, Neighbourhood Watch schemes have been encouraged with similar objectives in mind (ibid.: 295–6).
In the early 1980s, the Metropolitan police installed Divisional Information Officers to monitor the rise and fall of ‘tension indicators’(e.g. violence or abuse towards police officers, increasing numbers of complaints against the police and a decline in public co-operation) in specially targeted local communities and report their findings to the Central Information Unit within the Metropolitan Public Order Branch (Lloyd, 1989:273–4).
These indicators are used to identify ‘riot prone’ areas in London (ibid.).
The problem with using them is that they may produce a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Small incidents may be over-reacted to in the strong anticipation of trouble, rendering it more likely that confrontation will actually occur.
The surveillance of targeted individuals, organisations or localities may also be achieved via access to computer information.
For example, the Police National Computer (PNC) has a Suspect and Stolen Vehicles file which lists cars seen at demonstrations or owned by people who the police simply wish to keep an eye on, as well as vehicles suspected of being stolen or belonging to criminals (Manwaring-White, 1983:58–9).
Pounder (1985:76) argues that preliminary information of this nature will encourage  officers to place less emphasis on their own personal discretion and more emphasis on the background ‘history’ of the people involved.
In 1980, the Post Office Engineering Union alerted the general public to the increased prevalence of telephone tapping.
The police allegedly ‘listened in’ to conversations involving members of CND and were similarly active during the national steel and coal disputes (Docherty, 1983; Finch, 1989).
Infiltration by Special Branch officers posing as miners is said to have occurred during the coal dispute (McCabe and Wallington, 1988:145).
There have been several instances in the late 1980s of undercover operations leading to the rounding up of soccer hooligan offenders (Fielding, 1991:218).
Video cameras were used regularly in the late 1980s for crowd surveillance at soccer grounds, and as a method of enforcing post-match arrests (Uglow, 1988:95).
London demonstrations are routinely monitored by sixty cameras placed at symbolic locations, enabling an area of 200 square miles to be covered by the Scotland Yard operations room.
In addition, the police sometimes deploy ‘Heli-teles’— remote-control TV cameras with a wide-angle lens for scanning and a zoom-lens for focusing in — for use in helicopters.
The resolution of these cameras is good enough to pick out number plates or the faces of individual demonstrators.
Colour pictures monitored in a control room enable instructions to be relayed to police on the spot (ibid.:68–9).
Police riot training and technology
As early as 1978, one-third of all Metropolitan police officers received riot training (BSSRS, 1985:78).
This force now has the most sophisticated riot-training facilities in the United Kingdom, with special training centres at Greenwich and Hounslow.
The latter has its own ‘small town’ where riot simulations are carried out (Lloyd, 1989:270).
These arrangements are increasingly being adopted by other forces, all of which put their special units and Police Support Units through public order training.
Crowd-control training is complemented by courses on community and race relations.
But a Home Office study by Southgate (1982b) reported that officers saw little value in such training: they quickly forgot the content and saw it as no substitute for direct experience or the advice of senior colleagues.
Northam (1988) points out how the Metropolitan police have responded with ‘considerable imagination’ to the apathy and cynicism of lower ranks by putting them through courses designed to combat sexism, racism and what he calls the John Wayne machismo ‘canteen culture’.
The main problem is that they are then required to undergo training in  paramilitary riot control at Hounslow under the tuition of superfit instructors who convey a militaristic image.
Following the Lewisham disorders of 1977, perspex riot shields were introduced as standard police issue (BSSRS, 1985).
After the 1981 riots, improvements were made in the fireproofing of shields and garments and police officers were routinely provided with riot boilersuits (Lloyd, 1989).
In addition to these defensive provisions, forces were also provided with a range of offensive technology.
By November 1982, twenty-two of the forty-three forces had stocks of plastic bullets, and thirty had supplies of CS gas.
CS gas was used, against Home Office regulations, during the 1981 Toxteth riot, but has not been used since.
Similarly, the use of plastic bullets was authorised by the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Kenneth Newman, during the Broadwater Farm disturbance of 1985.
Here, too, weapons were not used, though, afterwards Sir Kenneth put the people of London ‘on notice’ that plastic bullets and CS gas would be used in the event of future disorder (ibid.:267).
Recent technological developments have enhanced the possibility of fatal shootings.
In April 1990, a week after the poll tax disorder, the Sunday Times Insight team revealed secret ACPO plans to deploy SAS-trained police marksmen in situations where rioters were thought to possess guns (Sunday Times , 8 April 1990).
A ‘Doomsday scenario’, outlined in the Association's Tactical Options Manual, provides for units of officers, equipped with Heckler and Koch machine guns, to be driven into riot situations by armoured landrovers.
In May 1991, it was disclosed that the Metropolitan police area was to be permanently patrolled by special units, known as ARVs (armed response vehicles).
These units would consist of three specially trained officers, driving around in Rover 827s, with each unit armed with two self-loading carbines and three handguns.
Eight such units were envisaged, and it was anticipated that between three and five would be on the streets at any given time (The Guardian , 10 May 1991).
As with the Doomsday scenario, this further militarisation of the police occurred without public debate or accountability.
Extended police powers
Provisions embodied in recent legislation, notably the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) and the Public Order Act 1986,
represent a quantum leap in police powers, reinforcing the view that  the British state is becoming increasingly authoritarian.
The public order legislation will mean that the police, besides being charged with the duty to keep the peace, will be enabled to mediate the already constrained ability to engage in protest and dissent on a much wider front
.
(Brewer et al , 1988:31)
In so far as they encourage greater police intervention on picket lines or at demonstrations, and enable them to impose their authority on many aspects of community life, the 1984 and 1986 Acts have profound implications for the possibility of disorder.
The PACE enables the police to stop and search any person whom they reasonably suspect of possessing stolen goods, an offensive weapon or items to be used in connection with a burglary or theft.
The person may be detained for as long as is ‘reasonably practicable’ to carry out such a search.
Reasonable force may be used against anyone who is uncooperative, and anyone failing to give their name and address when asked is liable to be arrested.
The Act also empowers the police to set up roadblocks to discover whether vehicles contain anyone who has witnessed, committed or is about to commit a serious crime.
Other provisions enable police officers to enter private property forcibly without a search warrant if they deem such action necessary to prevent a breach of the peace, reach someone who has committed an arrestable offence or search for evidence of an offence by someone they have already arrested.
Subject to obtaining a magistrate's warrant, police officers may also enter premises forcibly to look for evidence of a serious arrestable offence (ranging from murder and rape to any act which has led or might lead to public disorder, or, vaguer still, acts which might interfere with the effective administration of justice).
Under the Act, persons may be detained for questioning at a police station, without charge, for 36 hours on the police's own authority, and for a further 60 hours subject to successful application for a magistrate's order.
It is evident, even from this brief review of the Act, that its overall effect has been to legitimise and encourage numerous police practices (e.g. stop and search, roadblocks, forcible entry) which have consistently alienated and antagonised large sections of society — notably, black communities and trade-unionists — and had the accumulated effect of generating public disorder.
Similar antagonism is likely to be produced by the use of police discretion allowed under the Public Order Act 1986.
Several features of the Act which were designed to reduce the possibility of public disorder seem more likely to promote its occurrence.
This is most evident in those provisions relating to the policing of static assemblies and marches and processions.
The Act states that, in the case of marches and processions, organisers must give written notice, 6 clear days beforehand, of the date, starting time and route of the march, together with their own names and addresses.
The police can use their discretion to impose prior conditions on the march, such as when it occurs, its route and numerical strength.
They may also prohibit certain activities, such as the carrying of banners or the chanting of particular slogans.
These prior conditions may be determined by a chief constable or his deputy, or someone of equivalent rank in the Metropolitan police.
Once the march is in progress, the police may impose further conditions as they see fit (e.g. deciding to alter the route).
Here conditions may be set by the most senior officer present.
The grounds on which such conditions may be imposed include police perceptions that disorder might otherwise occur, that there exists the possibility of damage to people or property or that the march is likely to intimidate people, or interfere with or disrupt the life of the community.
Organisers failing to give notice or not complying with conditions risk arrest, conviction, possible 3 months' sentence or, 400 fine.
Participants who break any conditions are liable to arrest, conviction or a, 400 fine.
The Act retains the power of a Chief Constable or his/her deputy to ban a march under the 1936 Public Order Act.
Here the Chief applies to his Local Authority, who then seek the appropriate permission from the Home Secretary.
(The Metropolitan Police Commissioner applies directly to the Home Office.)
It is an offence to organise, or participate in, a banned march or procession.
The provisions related to public assemblies vary slightly from those for marches and processions.
A public assembly is defined as a gathering of twenty or more people in a place which is wholly or partially open to the air (e.g. a mass meeting, picket, demonstration or pop festival).
Advance notice is not required in these cases.
However, as with marches and processions, the police have the power to impose conditions on the location, duration and size of the assembly on similar grounds to those which apply to marches.
Equivalent penalties apply to anyone failing to observe these conditions.
As Lloyd points out, ‘In effect it is now up to the police to exercise their political judgement about our freedom to demonstrate’(1989:260).
This is bound to result in frequent problems.
Frustration will inevitably arise on any march or at any static assembly where participants believe that the police are imposing unnecessary or unreasonable conditions, rendering the protest ineffectual.
There is nothing to guarantee that police conditions will be adequately conveyed or heard before or during the march.
Events at the anti-poll tax rally showed how confusion and indignation can easily occur when police instructions are inaudible.
Given their virtually unlimited  powers to dictate what a dissenting group may or may not be allowed to do, there is a danger that police will prove less willing to negotiate arrangements with protest organisers, preferring to impose conditions as the law allows.
Obviously, this would be a fragile basis on which to reach a ‘contract with the crowd’.
A case study: operation ‘Kingfisher’
If the prospect of British ‘bobbies’ behaving like their LAPD counterparts seems too remote to be taken seriously, we might do well to consider the events of 29 September 1989 when 400 police officers carried out a drug raid on the Broadwater Farm Estate.
Operation ‘Kingfisher’ followed 2 months of planning, including the 3-week undercover surveillance of a launderette, reckoned to be the focus of drug-dealing activity.
At 5 p.m. — the time established as the peak of illegal activity — 200 officers and a complement of specially invited newspaper reporters and television crews moved in.
Teams of officers arrived on the scene in unmarked furniture vans.
Under the protection of bullet-proof vests and riot gear, they used axes and sledgehammers to break down doors before seizing twenty-four prisoners and a large haul of cannabis.
Afterwards, police distributed 2,500 copies of a letter explaining their actions to local residents.
Community leaders were fully debriefed.
Newspaper reports on the following day contained complaints of excessive behaviour by the police: some people claimed that doors throughout several blocks of flats had been unnecessarily destroyed.
A community leader had to be removed from the area under police escort when it was alleged that she had been used as a police informer.
The raid represented a convergence of the policing trends referred to in this chapter: the use of covert surveillance, including low-level intelligence; hard, paramilitary tactics and the enabling legislation to enforce them.
We may have witnessed the ‘moment’ of the ‘technocop’(BSSRS, 1985).
It therefore becomes imperative to ask: what are the existing mechanisms of democratic control over the police, and how effective are they?
DEMOCRATIC CONTROL MECHANISMS
The answers to these questions are considered by examining the nature and effectiveness of three methods of exerting democratic influence over police policy and behaviour: community-policing arrangements, the police complaints system and the relationship between police and elected representatives (the formal accountability system).
Community-policing arrangements
Community policing is based on the principle of a working partnership between the police and local community.
It is the revitalising of the whole tradition of policing by consent by increasing the level of trust by the community in its police, by fostering a deeper understanding by the police of community problems and community needs.
To achieve these ends, police seek to liaise and work with other agencies, consult their public, and stimulate the self-policing capacities of communities themselves.
In so doing, police provide initiatives and leadership, draw interested parties together, and tailor their policing to neighbourhood needs.
(Pope, 1985:104)
This philosophy was massively endorsed by the Scarman Report (Scarman, 1981), which advocated the setting up of community liaison procedures and the use of ‘beat’ officers as the principal ways of ensuring greater trust and co-operation between the police and their public.
The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 made it a legal requirement for Police Authorities to maintain consultative arrangements on behalf of the local community.
Though the Act did not specify what form the consultation should take, Home Office guidelines were issued recommending the establishment of police consultative committees.
These committees have some common features: membership includes representatives from the police, the police authority, constituent councils, and voluntary, statutory and community groups; meetings are held regularly and records kept; each has some sort of constitution; and the proceedings are generally publicly available.
(Brogden et al., 1988:175)
The objectives of these committees are to facilitate an exchange of views between the police and the wider community on issues of local concern; to help resolve conflict between the police and dissenting sections of the community; to encourage self-help and crime prevention activities; and to educate or inform the public regarding everyday police matters (Morgan, 1989).
The evidence suggests that community policing has not been the panacea that Lord Scarman envisaged.
Critics of consultative committees dismiss them as ineffectual talking shops, dominated by the ‘concerned and worthy’ middle classes and excluding those members of dispossessed  minorities on the receiving end of police policies (Brogden et al., 1988:176).
There are clear signs that many sections of the general public welcome the presence of home-beat officers (Shapland and Vagg, 1988; Waddington et al., 1990).
In a study carried out by Morris and Heal (1981), residents felt ‘more secure and confident’ following the introduction of beat officers.
Proponents of community policing often feel dismayed at the recklessness with which carefully cultivated relationships are undermined by the authorisation of ‘fire brigade’ tactics at the first suggestion of disorder.
Community policing continues to be afforded low priority and prestige within the police force, where it is generally characterised as ‘social work’ or not ‘real’policing (Fielding, 1991:170).
As Stephens points out, the ‘capture culture’, with its in-built preference for tough, reactive policing, still dominates the force.
In the meantime, ‘community policing has not developed into a partnership between police and public in the fight against crime.
It has remained dominated by the police and operates on the police's terms (Stephens, 1988:113).
Community-policing arrangements have not fared much better in the United States.
American officers tend to downgrade community policing as ‘unmanly’ or ‘unimportant’.
Since it was first introduced in the late 1960s, it has been resisted or treated with indifference by all ranks.
Community officers are castigated as ‘social workers’ or ‘Nigger lovers’, and community relations departments branded as ‘Commie Relations’units.
According to most officers, its only value lies in ‘selling the police’ to the public (Brewer et al., 1988:126; Riley, 1974:191).
Wintersmith (1974:71–7) evaluated the effectiveness of three American approaches to police-community relations (PCR).
The first approach involved despatching specially selected officers into ‘alienated neighbourhoods’ and having them operate from ‘storefront’mini-police stations, where they sometimes worked in teams, helping and advising marginal sections of society, like drug addicts and delinquent children.
According to Wintersmith, these officers helped to foster an atmosphere of mutual trust and co-operation.
However, the less-committed remainder of their colleagues accused them of ‘selling out the department’ and the resulting tension forced the community police officers to resign (ibid.:74).
The second approach to PCR — establishing citizens' committees (or neighbourhood-council forums)— proved equally ineffective.
‘For the most part, the closest the citizens ever came to confronting the police on specific issues was when an occasional individual dominated the entire meeting to register a personal grievance.
Those who participated were essentially propolice’(ibid.:72).
The third approach, ‘police-community  attitudinal change’, attempted to change officers' attitudes to minority groups via a series of lectures, encounter groups and sensitivity training.
This was impatiently rejected by police officers, who saw the methods involved as an attempt to subvert their authority and effectiveness (ibid.:75).
Police complaints procedures
The police complaints procedure provides a formal mechanism for citizens to lodge complaints about instances of police misconduct.
It is the Chief Constable's responsibility to see that these complaints are properly investigated and result in disciplinary action where appropriate.
The findings of these investigations, together with the Chief Constable's proposed course of action, are passed on to a key monitoring and supervisory body, the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), which may, if it has reason to be dissatisfied, overturn the Chief Constable's decision.
The PCA was established in April 1985 under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
It was designed as a more effective replacement for the Police Complaints Board (PCB) which the public appeared to have lost faith in due to the fact that few complaints were ever substantiated, and that all investigations were carried out by the police themselves.
The 1984 Act sought to make the system more independent of the police by giving the Police Complaints Authority more involvement in the running of ‘major’ investigations involving death, serious injury, assault, conspiracy and matters of public concern (including the policing of public disorder).
Under the 1984 Act, the PCA is empowered to:(i) choose, or veto the choice, of investigating officers, supervise their inquiries, and receive their final report;(ii) monitor the speed and efficiency of the investigation and issue a statement to the Chief Constable saying whether it was satisfactorily carried out;(iii) receive a Chief Constable's decision on what action he intends to take as a result of an investigation and, if need be, overturn the decision (either by preferring disciplinary charges or, if it believes an offence has been committed, referring the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions).
In the latter case, the PCA may still choose to bring disciplinary charges even if the DPP decides there are insufficient grounds for prosecution.
The outcomes of successive PCA investigations of episodes of public disorder have cast serious doubts about its independence and effectiveness.
A brief summary of the PCA investigation of complaints about police tactics used to clear demonstrators from the steps of Manchester University's Students' Union building during a visit by the then Home Secretary, Leon Britain, in March 1985 highlights the origins of this concern.
The severity of these tactics (cf.
Manchester City Council, 1986) prompted thirty-three specific individual complaints and seventy-one general complaints related to police misconduct.
The subsequent 15-month investigation was carried out by officers from the Avon and Somerset Constabulary.
These officers were accused by complainants of failing to remain impartial, of adopting hostile and dismissive attitudes towards them and of using complainants' own statements as evidence against them in court.
It was further alleged that some complainants were shadowed, intimidated and, even, assaulted while going about their daily affairs (Out of Court , BBC 2, 4 March 1987).
The investigation resulted in criminal charges against three police officers (two for perjury and one for assault) but the PCA found insufficient evidence to substantiate the remaining complaints.
The authority had intended to publish a full summary of its findings but was prevented from doing so by the DPP who felt that it would prejudice the trials of the three officers.
However, sections of the press saw this as an attempt to suppress the investigation's key finding: that police insensitivity and mismanagement was largely to blame for the evening's confrontation (cf.
Observer , 1 March 1987).
Increasing numbers of potential complainants now prefer to take civil actions against the police (Emerson, 1989:26).
An ITN cameraman injured during a police charge at Wapping received an undisclosed out-of-court settlement from the Metropolitan Police after a High Court damages claim (The Guardian , 25 January 1989).
Such people seem to have grasped the key distinction that:
The consequence of winning a civil action is compensation in money whereas if a complaint is upheld, you receive nothing beyond the satisfaction of knowing there is a chance that the officer(s) in question will be disciplined or, just possibly, prosecuted.
(Thornhill, 1989:345)
Debates over the possibility of using civilians to investigate complaints against British police officers often contain references to the ineffectiveness of American Civilian Review Boards (Cohen, 1985:262).
It is indisputable that such obstacles as poor financing and staffing, and sustained police opposition have made them practically unworkable: ‘typically the pressure of police unions and the operation of political manipulation has resulted in these Boards becoming inoperative edifices to the democratic principle, or at best fairly toothless bureaucracies’(McKenzie and Gallagher, 1989:109).
Where they survive, Review Boards tend to lack true independence  from the police and seldom break down the barriers of police secrecy and their refusal to co-operate (Cohen, 1985:262).
Formal police accountability mechanisms
Police accountability is the constitutional mechanism which makes the police answerable for their actions.
The present institutional structure is based on regulations contained in the 1964 Police Act.
Under the Act, the British police force is divided into forty-three separate constabularies.
In London, the Metropolitan police force is accountable solely to the Home Secretary.
The City of London Police (who are responsible only for a square mile at the centre of London) are controlled by a committee of elected councillors.
The remaining police forces come under the joint supervision of partially elected police authorities, the chief constable and the Home Secretary.
Police forces outside of London receive 51 per cent of their funding from the Home Office and the other 49 per cent from local government via a levy on the rates.
Most of the Metropolitan Police's bill is paid by the Home Office because of its many ‘national’ police services.
The roles and responsibilities of each member of the tripartite system are prescribed by the 1964 Act.
The Local Police Authority (made up of twelve elected councillors and six appointed magistrates) is responsible for maintaining an adequate police force (i.e. in terms of finance, equipment, accommodation and personnel), and making arrangements for local consultation.
Members may call for a report on policing matters from the chief constable; and can appoint, discipline and fire senior officers.
All of these are subject, however, to the Home Secretary's approval.
The chief constable is responsible for the direction and control of the force.
He (there are no female chief constables) is, technically at least, the ‘sole determinant’ of police policy.
He has a statutory obligation to submit an annual report to his local authority and may be asked (but need not necessarily deliver) a report on any aspect of police policy required by the authority.
The Home Secretary is legally required to promote the efficiency of the police.
She/he may withhold the central grant to any force deemed inefficient by the Home Office Inspectorate.
The minister may also call for the retirement of a chief constable.
She/he may direct a chief officer to provide mutual aid to another force and, in the event of any disagreement, determine the relative allocation of costs between an aided and aiding authority.
In practice, the LPA may offer advice to the chief constable on matters  of policy, but he is under no legal obligation to accept it.
It is virtually impossible for a Police Authority to obtain a report from a chief constable contrary to his wishes.
The latter may simply reply that he does not feel it is in the  public's interest, or that the Police Authority does not strictly require it to effectively carry out its duties.
By contrast, in addition to the possibility of withholding the central grant, the Home Secretary may use other avenues of influence:
The Home Office informs local forces of its views by advisory circulars of which there are about 100 a year.
These circulars, though advisory in name, are essentially mandatory.
They are frequently the result of liaison between the Home Office and Acpo.
Although Chief Constables cavil occasionally they treat circulars as commands.
But they are not the result of any form of democratic consultation and LPAs are given no right to see them, even though the policy advanced might directly impinge on their financial responsibilities.
Nor is there any means for Parliament to discuss these circulars.
(Uglow, 1988:130)
Thus, as Brewer et al (1988:16) point out, the tripartite structure is actually a bipartite system of control.
The policing of the coal dispute provided a clear illustration of this point (Uglow, 1988).
Reiner's (1989) interviews with thirty-nine chief constables in England and Wales revealed that most regarded their authority as ‘useful sounding boards’, but were prepared to go against their recommendations if it suited them.
Conversely, Home Office guidelines were only exceptionally ignored since ‘They were seen as having a legitimacy stemming from the fact of representing the authoritative interpretation of the law by the elected government of the day’(ibid.:211).
Chief officers continue to oppose any reform of the present system.
As listening-posts attuned to balancing all shades of community opinion, they see themselves as more representative than formally elected representatives, who may represent a merely temporary or apparent majority.
In any event, they claim both a legal and moral mandate to act according to their ‘consciences’, tempered as these are by professional experience and wide public consultation.
(Reiner, 1989:208–9)
The American system of police accountability bears no relationship to its British tripartite structure.
In America, the majority of urban police departments are headed by a chief of police, selected and appointed by the elected local mayor.
Less frequently, the chief may be appointed by a city  or county manager, or an administrator, appointed by local councillors (cf.
McKenzie and Gallagher, 1989).
In theory, accountability is exercised when constituents take the mayor's policing record into account in local elections.
But this system is inevitably prejudicial against minority sections of the community.
The close relationship between police chiefs and elected mayors in American cities makes it difficult for the former not to curry favour with what is perceived as the ‘majority view’ within his (sic) jurisdiction….
The police chief fears that his appointment could be terminated if he carries out policies that impinge directly on the interests of the mayor's political supporters: electoral considerations and impartial policing thus make awkward bedfellows.
(Brewer et al., 1988:116)
Nevertheless, some of the tension which existed between the police and black communities in the 1960s appears to have been relieved by an increase in the number of elected black politicians and their moderating influence on police policy: ‘The growth of elected and appointed black people in the political system means that racialist and violent police behaviour comes to be more and more criticised and highlighted’(Kilson, 1987:59).
Alongside this, the US Supreme Court has expanded citizens' rights to sue police departments or their chief for officer misconduct.
The individual officer is rarely held personally liable for his or her actions: damages are paid by the city, while legal costs are met by the union.
However, such procedures are expensive, encouraging police departments to exercise more discipline over rank-and-file officers (Sherman, 1983:227).
These political and legal developments have encouraged a pronounced shift of emphasis: from a law enforcement conception of policing, which ‘views enforcement of the law as an end in itself, regardless of its consequences for the social order’ to a peace-keeping conception which ‘views law enforcement as a means towards an end: the highest possible level of public safety, order and preservation of life and property’(Sherman, 1983:230).
Sherman believes that, as a result of these changes, police are more likely to talk their way out of a potentially disorderly situation than they were in the 1960s (ibid.:231).
This peace-keeping conception of policing is less likely to apply where democratic influence is too weak to restrain a police chiefs commitment to a law-enforcement conception.
This is illustrated by the controversy surrounding a highly publicised racial assault by members of the LAPD on a black motorist on 3 March 1991.
Here a national outcry was provoked  when fifteen white police officers either stood by and watched or personally took part in the systematic assault of a black man whom they had stopped after a car chase.
The officers struck or kicked the motorist, Rodney King, more than fifty times, causing serious head, leg and abdominal injuries.
Unknown to them, the whole incident was videotaped by an amateur photographer and pictures were subsequently broadcast on nationwide television (The Guardian , 22 March 1991).
This prompted civil rights organisations and black politicians to demand the resignation of the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, Daryl Gates.
Then, on Tuesday, 2 April, the city's black mayor, Tom Bradley, publicly stated that he had asked Gates to resign from his job.
Gates refused to tender his resignation on the grounds that his 8,300 members were depending on him to provide strong leadership in a difficult situation (The Guardian , 4 April 1991).
The problem confronting Bradley was that Los Angeles operates according to a structure of authority in which power is devolved between the mayor, the city council and tenured civil servants.
City laws therefore prevented the mayor from firing his chief.
Bradley's personally appointed police commission suspended Gates from office, only for the city council to return him to duty via the courts.
By May 1991, the issue had not been legally resolved.
In the meantime, a political representative of the city's black population was asking, ‘What if the people of South Central realize that they cannot remove Daryl Gates?’
It was an outcome which, she ominously predicted, ‘could be very dangerous’(Newsweek , 20 May 1991).
DISCUSSION
This chapter has provided overwhelming support for Northam's assertion that police paramilitarism is now a fact of British life:
Almost every major city in Britain has a police force armed with plastic bullets, CS gas and live firearms, and trained to use them to put down disturbances.
Its policemen and policewomen have undergone a rigorous course of crowd control techniques modelled on the riot squads used throughout the British colonies.
The men who walk our streets as community bobbies today are equipped and ready to take them by force tomorrow.
(Northam, 1988:130–1)
Developments in police-control techniques have been accompanied by a major extension of police powers which encourage their intervention, not only on marches, at demonstrations and mass pickets, but in the everyday  affairs of the community.
The recent provision of mobile, armed response units in the Metropolitan area, and police activities like Operation ‘Kingfisher’ suggest that Los Angeles-style ‘street sweeps’are an alarming possibility.
Not that current democratic safeguards could offer much protection.
All are ineffectual.
Community liaison committees tend to steer clear of contentious issues, and the agenda is usually set by the police.
The police complaints procedure remains a ‘watchdog without teeth’(Emerson, 1989).
Finally, the tripartite system of accountability is ‘amenable to a high degree of central influence and control’, but operates as a bipartite structure with ‘occasional genuflections towards the local authority’(Uglow, 1988:130).
Who knows how close the rest of Britain came to resembling Northern Ireland when plastic bullets were introduced at Broadwater Farm, but not used due to a decrease in the violence.
Had the situation been different and plastic bullets had been fired, the longer-term consequence would have been to have moved the police significantly towards the position where the use of baton rounds was perceived by them as an appropriate method of crowd dispersal during large-scale civil disturbance.
Such decisions, however, are taken by the police; the public has no direct say.
Indeed, when a police authority has instructed its local constabulary not to purchase stockpiles of baton rounds nor to undertake training in their use, the Home Office has stepped in to circumvent this instruction by allowing police forces to hold such devices on permanent loan.
(Stephens, 1988:85)
Britain urgently requires a mechanism for influencing the policies and behaviour of its police.
American democratic and legal structures strong enough to restrain police behaviour have produced a reduction of public disorder.
The precise form of the structures required to ensure more effective police accountability in this country is one of several policy recommendations to be outlined in the concluding chapter.

The failure of Conservative criminology under Thatcher
In this chapter we will consider the impact of the Conservative's law and order policies on the crime rates themselves.
We begin with a brief look at the official figures, since, whatever the shortcomings of these statistics, and no matter how distorted a picture of ‘real’ crime they portray, they do nevertheless have real effects, since they are used, for example, in political debate and inform, at least partially, the public's perception of the crime problem.
The 1980s has seen the victimisation, or crime, survey become a major growth industry in the UK.
The spotlight they have cast on ‘real’ levels of crime and its impact are important new factors in the criminological debate.
Our discussion of such surveys both at the national and local level lead us on to examine the impact of crime on women and ethnic minorities, and to a broader consideration of how these groups are treated by the criminal justice system.
Finally, noting the prominence of assertions to the contrary, by Conservative speakers, we will conclude this chapter by looking at the relationship between crime and unemployment.
MORE POLICE AND MORE CRIME
We have noted changes in procedural legislation, as well as changes in the actual nature of policing in previous chapters.
The increase in police powers and the subsequent curtailment in civil liberties, rest on the Conservative Party's alarm over the increase in crime.
But have these expanded powers and the concomitant increase in punitiveness had the desired effect upon crime?
Between May 1979 and March 1988 the number of police officers increased 11 per cent(from 111,493 to 124,080).
The number of serving police officers per 1,000 population had increased by 20 per cent during the 1970s (Burrows and Tarling 1987, p.230) and the increase continued during the Thatcher decade.
By 1988–89 there were 3.89 officers per 1,000 population in the Metropolitan Police District, while the average outside London  was 2.18 (CIPFA 1990).
Civilian workers employed by the police went up by 12 per cent between 1979 and 1988 (34,630 to 41,800).
Police salaries adjusted for inflation went up from 983 million in 1979 when the Conservatives came to power, to 2,378 million by 1987, a rise of some 47 per cent in real terms.
By 1988–89 they had reached 3,825 million, with police manpower increased by 16,000 officers.
Total police expenditure (operational expenditure including salary costs, buildings, equipment, increased 64 per cent in real terms by 1987,(1,178 million to 3,163 million).
Add to the enlarged programme of prison building, the feeding and housing of more and more convicted prisoners, the costs of the exploding remand population, and expenditure on the justice system presents a stark contrast with the swingeing cutbacks of other areas in the public sector.
It is the highly publicised rise in crime, and the Government's exploitation of the fear that it produces, which has justified increased expenditure since 1979 on the police, at a time of cutbacks on other sections of the public sector, such as health, income maintenance schemes, education and housing.
Has this increase in manpower and resources been effective?
Has the Conservatives' emphasis on strong policing and punishment succeeded where the supposedly soft approach of the Labour Party had failed?
Not according to Downes and Young (1987), who found that in the post-war period, the rate of increase of crime under the Conservatives was, on average, twice that under Labour.
As we have seen, the Conservative Party made much, prior to the ‘79 General Election, of the increase in crime during time in office of the 1974–79 Labour Government.
While we shall comment further below on the use of such officially constructed statistics, which may reflect,inter alia , changing public attitudes to reporting crime, police practice in recording crime or changing priorities concerning crime seriousness, as well as changes in underlying crime levels, we may be excused some ironic enjoyment in examining the patterns in these figures during the Thatcher decade.
Between 1979 and 1988 the total number of indictable offences known to the police (ignoring offences of criminal damage of value 20 or less) increased by just under 50 per cent(the 1988 total was in fact 4.5 per cent down on the previous year).
According to Criminal Statistics for England and Wales 1988, during these 9 years of Conservative law and order, violent offences increased by 66.5 per cent, robbery by 151.2 per cent , burglary by 50.3 per cent , theft by 37.3 per cent and fraud and forgery by 13.4 per cent .
Increases in the 1990 crime rate were to be even worse.
The figures for the first quarter of 1990 showed an increase of 15 per cent on the corresponding period of 1989, the largest rise in crime since records began in 1857.
But the statistics for the second quarter, announced just before the October Conference of the Conservative Party, were even more damaging to the Government showing a rise of 17 per cent on 1989.
Indeed these figures made even sorrier reading for  the Conservatives when one realised that demographic shifts were working in the Government's favour.
Historically, the major group of offenders are 14- to 20-year-old males and these peaked as a proportion of the population in 1982 at 6.77 per cent(of the total population over the age of 10) before declining to 5.99 per cent in 1988.
Taylor (1987) points out that in the United States during the 1980s, the Reagan Administration, pursuing similar policies to those of the Conservatives, presided over a decline in crime and asks why the United Kingdom was different.
He sees part of the answer in the massive recession suffered by the British economy at that time, a point to which we shall return below.
Steffensmeier and Harer (1987) have argued that at least part of this decline in the US may be attributed to demographic factors i.e. to a declining number of young males.
Clearly the same did not occur in the UK; the increased propensity to offend more than counterbalanced the decline in the high-offender groups in the population (Liddelow 1990).
While it is difficult to draw any definite conclusions from such bald statistics on recorded crime, they clearly posed a major embarrassment for a Government pledged to reduce the crime rate.
What is clear, as we shall see below from both victimisation studies and official statistics, is that the crime rate had not decreased under the Conservatives and Home Office projections for the 1990s suggested that the increase was likely to continue.
The forecasts were for a 28 per cent increase between 1983 and 1993 (although the demographic shifts noted above may reduce this), and indeed by 1989 the increase was already 19 per cent.
These figures provide political ammunition to chief police officers arguing for more resources, although this is clearly a double-edged sword since the figures could be interpreted as showing the police being unable to do much about crime levels.
One problem with statistics of recorded crime is that they are functions both of police administrative practices and of the public's propensity to report offences.
Changes in either or both will produce changes in recorded crime trends.
For example, since 1972 the General Household Survey (GHS) has, at irregular intervals carried questions on household burglaries.
Over the period 1972–87 Mayhew et al .
(1989), combining GHS and British Crime Survey (BCS) figures, suggest that household burglary rose by 17 per cent while police figures showed an increase nearly 8 times more -127 per cent.
This discrepancy in trends was greater for the earlier years of this period between 1983 and 1987 ‘there is no statistically sound evidence that the trends diverge’(Mayhew et al .
1989, p.20).
Mayhew et al .
follow Lewis and Mo (1986) in arguing that the discrepancy may be due to a greater rise in the serious burglaries which involve insurance claims, and hence are more likely to be reported, especially given the increase in the number of personal telephones and the higher levels of home ownership.
Alternatively, the public may simply have become more sensitised to crime, through media and press  reports or the Government's crime prevention publicity, and so believing crime to be on the increase they are more likely to report offences leading to a rise in recorded crime which will lead to further media attention and so on in a ‘deviancy amplification spiral’.
Other changes in reporting may be due to shifts in public perceptions of police attitudes towards specific crimes.
Sexual offences and particularly rape may fall into this category.
We will look at other methods of assessing the level and effects of crime in a moment, but we note here that both survey-based estimates and police statistics show increasing levels of crime, the differences are of degree not direction.
A second question to ask when considering the effectiveness of the increased powers and resources commanded by the police since 1979 is have they become more successful at clearing up crime.
Again from Criminal Statistics (1988) we see that there has been an increase in the number of offences cleared up by the police, between 1979 and 1988 of 27.3 per cent(from 980,700 to 1,248,900).
However, if we look at clear-up rates, those cleared up as a percentage of the total number of recorded offences we find that a 15 per cent decline from 41 per cent in 1979 to 35 per cent in 1988.
Moreover, looking at total dear-up rates flatters the police, since it includes crimes which, by their very nature, are usually cleared up as soon as they are reported.
For example, fraud and forgery usually only come to light when an organisation discovers the offender.
Similarly shops will often only report shoplifting when they have apprehended the culprit.
As Burrows and Tarling (1987) note, the major offence categories of burglary, robbery and criminal damage all have relatively low clear-up rates (29 per cent, 23 per cent and 24 per cent , respectively in 1988).
However, there are more fundamental problems with clear-up rates.
A crime may be recorded as cleared by the police for a variety of reasons: where an individual has been charged or summonsed for the offence (whether or not they are found guilty!); where an individual admits an offence and receives a formal caution from a senior police officer; where an individual convicted of an offence asks, before sentence for other offences to be ‘taken into consideration’(TICs); where forces officially take ‘no further action’ and the offence is written off.
This may occur for various reasons; the suspect may have died or be below the age of criminal responsibility, the victim may not wish to press charges or a witness may be unwilling, or unable, to give evidence or a person already in detention after conviction admits to further offences.
Following revelations in the Observer ,(Nick Davies' ‘Crime, the great cop out’, 13.7.86, p.1) and ‘More policemen confirm crime figures scandal’(Observer 20.7.86, p.6), which suggested that the clear-up rate, in Kent and elsewhere was inaccurate and sometimes fabricated, Gill (1987) challenged the use of the clear-up rate as an assessment of police effectiveness.
He looked  at the crime figures reported by the Merseyside police, where the increase in clear-up rates could be shown to be related to the number of prison visits by police officers.
These visits were extremely fruitful sources of confessions to hitherto unsolved crimes which subsequently were classified NPA, and hence cleared up.
They were drastically reduced in 1985–86 because of overtime cuts forced upon the police by the local police authority as one of the ways of responding to the budgetary impact of rate capping.
The consequent decrease in clear-up rates was almost entirely due to a drop in NFA numbers.
A second interesting example of how police practice affects crime figures is given by Farrington, and Dowds (1985).
In a study of Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and Staffordshire police, they found that 25 per cent of all crimes discovered in Notts came from admission by those in custody, while in Leicestershire and Staffordshire the figures were 4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively.
The apparent higher crime rate in Notts was almost entirely due to this factor and the Notts police ‘s greater tendency to record trivial offences.
A further quirk in the Notts approach to gathering statistics is that until 1982 they counted as TIC those offences offered to the court but denied by the offenders!
If changes in detected crime levels need to be monitored with some scepticism, the real rate of crime is also problematic because of unrecorded crime.
As well as distortions to the official figures produced by police recording practice, there are a variety of reasons why victims of crime often do not report offences.
They may consider them too trivial or feel that the police would be able to offer little assistance.
The offences may occur within the family or between acquaintances and to report them may be socially disruptive.
Alternatively, and this applies particularly to domestic offences, the victim may feel that the police are unwilling to take the matter seriously.
Certain groups of individuals — ethnic minorities, homosexuals, young people — may also be suspicious of the attitudes of the police towards them.
For all these, and other reasons, official crime figures will underestimate the true figure.
In attempts to obtain alternative estimates of crime levels but also to gain information on various topics such as fear of crime, attitudes to the police, public views on punishment and impact of crime, the last decade has seen the proliferation of the crime survey in Britain.
The major impetus for this work have been the national surveys carried out by the Home Office, the British Crime Surveys of 1982, 1984 and 1988.
These have been followed by a number of local area surveys usually commissioned by Labour-controlled councils and usually focusing on inner city areas.
The most quoted are the two Islington surveys carried out in 1985 and 1988 and the Merseyside survey of 1984.
Crime surveys attempt to bypass the problems of police statistics noted above, by asking a sample of respondents about their experiences  of crime, both reported and unreported, to obtain a more accurate picture of crime levels.
They are not without their own problems of course.
Young (1988) has, for example, noted that for local and national crime surveys, the response rate (the proportion of individuals chosen for inclusion in a survey who actually complete a questionnaire) has never been above 80 per cent .
Young points out that this means the victimisation of over 20 per cent of respondents is still unknown and that such a large proportion could easily skew findings from the surveys.
He argues that this number:
probably includes a disproportionate number of transients, of lower working class people hostile to officials with clipboards attempting to ask them about their lives, and those most frightened to answer.
(Young 1988)
The 1988 BCS estimates of crime levels show that in 1987 the amount of under-reporting of crime varied substantially between types of crime.
For example, only 10 per cent of vandalism and 12 per cent of theft from the person were estimated to be reported, while for burglary, the estimated percentage was 41 per cent and for motor vehicle theft 86 per cent (Mayhew et al .
1989, p. 10).
Overall the survey suggested 37 per cent of offences were reported.
The problem of the ‘dark’ figure of crime, the ‘real’crime level, which is so much greater than the official statistics for recorded crime, seems to indicate a far more serious problem than previously acknowledged.
However, the picture which Home Office researchers have used the successive surveys to portray is one where the majority of unreported crime is of a trivial nature.
They have attempted to use the survey figures to counteract fear of crime.
They have argued that most crime is petty and that the increase in recorded crime is more to do with the public's decreased tolerance than anything else:
The real message of the BCS is that it calls into question assumptions about crime upon which people's concern is founded.
It emphasises the petty nature of most law breaking — a point which also emerges from Criminal Statistics but is often overlooked….
Of the offences uncovered by the BCS only a tiny proportion were crimes of serious violence, and very few were serious property offences such as burglary or car theft.
The vast majority were, for example, petty thefts, acts of vandalism, and minor assaults.
A corollary of this is that the risks which people face of being victims of serious crime are remarkably small.
(Hough and Mayhew 1983, p.33)
The British Crime Surveys (BCS) were set up at least partly because of official scepticism over police statistics, and in an attempt to counteract the portrayal in parts of the media of crime rates soaring out of control.
It is a  liberal questioning of criminal statistics collected and collated by the police themselves.
As we noted above, the latest 1988 BCS indicates, that indeed, crime is not rising as steeply as police statistics imply.
The BCS suggested that in fact the prospect of suffering from sexual assault, robbery or burglary was unlikely when considering the country as a whole.
For example, the 1982 survey reported that:
a ‘statistically average’ person aged 16 or over can expect: a robbery once every five centuries (not attempts), an assault resulting in injury (even if slight) once every century, the family car to be taken by joyriders once every 60 years, a burglary in the home once every 40 years.
(Hough and Mayhew 1983, p. 15)
Furthermore, the BCS distinguished between the fear of crime, i.e. people's fear of being victimised, and concern with crime, people's more general anxiety about crime which did not have to do with personal Ask.
Basically, fear of crime, it is argued, is out of proportion with the actual probability of being a victim.
Maxfield (1987) in looking at the fear of crime, found that this profoundly affected a minority of people's lives.
We obtain a national picture of crime and people's attitudes towards it from the three BCS, but for their critics these surveys have emphasised this national picture at the expense of the inner cities, which suffered more than their fair share of crime.
Furthermore, while quotes like those above have an immediate impact they ignore the variations in the patterns of victimisation due to age, race and gender.
These considerations led to the awareness of the need for local crime surveys which focused on the crime problems of smaller geographical areas and their impact upon specific sub-groups of the population.
For example, Kinsey (1985) states that:
It appears that on Merseyside personal crimes are only marginally more common than in England and Wales generally.
In relation to offences involving personal violence there would appear to be little evidence from the survey to substantiate claims that Merseyside is an exceptionally violent area In relation to household crimes, however, the rate in Merseyside is substantially higher and in the case of burglary three times higher than the national average.
(Kinsey 1985, p.5)
Perhaps more importantly the Merseyside Crime Survey (MCS) showed clearly that the impact of crime fell disproportionately on the elderly and the poor:
While men and women under 30 are most often the victims of crime, the impact is greatest upon those over 50.
However personal and household  crime in Merseyside appears from the survey to be most pervasive in the poorest areas of the count: there is more of it and the effect is most severe.
There can be no doubt that both in terms of the quantity and impact of the crimes examined the poor suffer more than the wealthy.
The problems appear critical for the 20 per cent of the Merseyside population living in the poorest council housing and especially in the district of Knowsley where 48 per cent of the population (six times the national average) live in such areas.
(Kinsey 1985, p. 16) and again:
Throughout the whole of Merseyside crime is seen as a major social problem but, as has been seen, it is in the poor areas where the victimisation rates are highest, the impact of crime is greatest and the anxiety most intense.
Merseysiders in general worry a lot about crime but those under the greatest social and economic pressure also suffer most from crime: they worry more, perhaps too much, but they do have the most to worry about.
(Kinsey 1985, p.24)
This focus upon the real impact of crime upon the poor, women and ethnic minorities is also an important part of the left realist approach to criminology.
The realists have undertaken several crime surveys for London councils and have placed great emphasis on the need to look at the pattern of victimisation of the oppressed, claiming that:
If you add to the concern for blacks as victims a concern for the working class, for the poor, for the vulnerable and for women, you have an understanding of the realist approach today.
(Jones et al .
1986, p.1)
The Islington Crime Survey (ICS) of 1985 was the first study to focus solely on an inner city area According to the Department of the Environment Islington is the seventh most deprived area of England and the fifth worst area where housing is concerned.
In order to ensure reasonable numbers of respondents from ethnic minority groups the survey oversampled from them using an ‘ethnic minority booster sample,’ a device which the 1988 BCS also adopted.
They found that even within Islington there were wide differences in offence rates.
For burglary, for example, the area with the highest risk of this crime, Mildmay, the rate is eight and one half times as high as that for the area with the lowest Ask.
Young people, black people and men were more at risk from burglary, particularly if they lived in the Mildmay area For theft from the person, women are in general more at risk than men, blacks are more  likely to be victimised than whites and the risk of victimisation decreases with age.
The ICS gives a detailed picture of the incidence of assault in the area.
During the period covered by the survey there were an estimated 11,878 incidents which respondents considered to be assault.
Figure 2.8 in Jones et al .
(1986) shows that only an estimated 6 per cent of such offences were reported to the police.
An estimated 22 per cent of all assaults were domestic, 7 per cent were racist and 3.5 per cent police assaults.
The authors note:
Younger people are on average thirteen times as likely to be assaulted as people in the over 45 years of age category.
Black people on average are almost twice as likely as other people to be victims of assault and women are almost twice as likely again as men to be assaulted.
(Jones et al .
1986, p.65)
The differences between the ICS, an the one hand, and the BCS and official statistics on the other, in the treatment of domestic violence and sexual assault will be returned to later.
The second ICS was carried out during 1989.
It found that in the 3 years since the first survey, crime had moved from third place to the top of people ‘s list of problems affecting their neighbourhood.
Furthermore, the respondent's confidence in the ability of the police to deal with problem had declined.
It reinforced the image of women under siege.
Taking all age groups it estimated that 74 per cent of women stayed in very or fairly often.
Kinsey (1985) found a similar story in Merseyside:
The picture which has emerged is one of people of the inner city especially the women — living under curfew.
While, as has been seen, the actual chances of victimisation are less than many people believe, nonetheless, in Granby, for example, three quarters of those interviewed believe there are real Asks for women who go out at night and half said they often or always avoid going out after dark.
(Kinsey 1985, p.23)
We turn in the next section to consider in more detail the effect of crime upon women.
OFFENCES AGAINST WOMEN
We argued earlier that the crime surveys commissioned by Labour Local Authorities in areas such as Islington, Merseyside, and Hammersmith and Fulham attempted to put the findings of the BCS into an inner city context.
One aspect of this was to focus on the experiences of particular groups: the poor, women and ethnic minorities.
In the words of Kinsey et al .
(1986)‘It needs emphasizing that crime and fear of crime hit working class women  more than any other major section of society.’
In particular, these local surveys suggested that the fear that young women had concerning sexual assault was quite justified.
Jones,et al .
(1986) found that in Islington during the period covered there were about 1200 cases of sexual assault.
Of these only 21 per cent were reported to the police and only an estimated 9 per cent were recorded in the criminal statistics.
Young females are 18 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than those over 45.
Class shows itself in the fact that women who are council tenants are three times more likely to be sexually assaulted, than those who are owner-occupiers.
The 1982 and 1984 BCS between them only uncovered two cases of attempted rape and 17 and 18 sexual assaults respectively (Jones et al .
1986, p.69).
R. Hall (1985) suggested this under-reporting is perhaps partly because the BCS used some male interviewers.
This was not supported by the results of the ICS, whose authors claim that their male interviewers actually uncovered more cases of sexual assault than did female interviewers.
What was undoubtedly important, however, was that the ICS briefed and trained its interviewers to deal with the part of the questionnaire which dealt with sexual offences, and indeed when a case was uncovered by a male interviewer he always offered a follow-up interview conducted by a woman.
These were usually declined (Jones et al .
1985, p.71).
A survey by Living Magazine (14.8.89) which questioned 1,000 women, found that one-third had received obscene phone calls in the last year, 20 per cent of this group more than once, yet only 26 per cent had told the police, 13 per cent had been interfered with and 87 per cent of these kept silent; 9 per cent had suffered indecent exposure and 92 per cent failed to report this.
Of the sample 49 per cent felt that being pestered by men was inevitable.
The rise in recorded sexual offences (Criminal Statistics 1988) is usually explained as an artefact of more sensitive and sophisticated police recording procedures and improved victim treatment, rather than a real underlying change, but hard evidence to support this is not clear.
A major problem is still undoubtedly  women's negative attitudes towards the police stemming from their historically well-founded fears that the police do little in cases of domestic violence, and are unsympathetic to sexual offences.
The local surveys have also emphasised the impact of domestic violence on women.
As Walklate points out:
incorporating an understanding of domestic violence, in particular, begins to alter somewhat the influence of gender as variable in the patterning of victimization as compared with BCS findings.
(Walklate 1989, p.37)
Domestic violence against women probably has the greatest number of unreported offences.
In the United States the FBI believes it is probably ten  times more underreported than rape (quoted in Smith 1989).
The 1982 BCS found that 10 per cent of assault victims were women who has been attacked by present or previous husbands or boyfriends (Hough and Mayhew 1983).
The 1984 survey estimated just over 200,000 incidents of domestic assault in England and Wales in 1983.
It found in 12.5 per cent of assaults and crimes of violence the respondent reported the involvement of family, lover or ex-lovers.
Hough and Mayhew (1988) regard these figures as underestimates and Worrall and Pease ‘s (1986) re-analysis of the BCS data which looked at all crimes, and attempted crimes, involving contact and where the victim could identify whether or not they knew the offender, found that women were much more likely to say that they knew the offender well and that the offender was a spouse in nearly 40 per cent of cases.
The ICS showed, that while, as we have seen, domestic violence was a considerable problem, comprising an estimated 22 per cent of all assaults in the borough, it was one usually not taken very seriously by the police.
The London Strategy Policy Unit (1986) suggests that this estimate would mean an annual figure of over three quarters of a million for London as a whole.
The Metropolitan Police as a whole receive over 1,000 calls concerned with domestic violence from women each week (Cowell,et al .
1986).
As well as being victims of crime women also suffer from the effects of fear of crime.
We noted above the MCS findings of self-imposed curfew by many women in Merseyside.
The ICS paints a similar picture:
‘women generally, and particularly older and black women, feel it is necessary to restrict their behaviour and avoid certain situations as a precaution against crime.
In this sense, the Islington Crime Survey helps to illustrate that a ‘curfew on women’ appears to be implicitly operative .
(Jones et al .,
1986, p. 169; italics in original)
RACE AND CRIME
One of the hidden agendas in the crime statistics issues has already been raised in our examination of the phenomenon of mugging.
We have seen how the issue of race was first raised in the 1982 Metropolitan Police statistics which recorded the race of both victim and assailant in London.
The emphasis in ‘black crime’ has focused on youth, and consequently it is black youth that have been portrayed as folk devils who make the streets unsafe.
Tuck and Southgate (1981) had found that 50 per cent of offenders reported by black victims were black, which reflects American data on intra-racial violent crime.
Matthews (1987) using American Bureau of Justice figures for 1987, found that in America there is considerable variability in class and racial distribution of offender victim relations for different types  of crime, compounded by age and gender and geographical location (see also O'Brien 1987).
However for crime in general:
‘approximately ¾ of whites are victimised by whites, while on the whole over 80 per cent of blacks are victimised by blacks.
However robbery, rape and assault are predominantly intra-racial for white offenders in America, but significantly inter-racial for black offenders.
(Matthews 1987, p.389)
The British picture is different; rapes, robbery and assault are predominantly intra-racial as far as can be analysed, except for racial attacks on blacks.
Young and Lea note that:
a young black male (aged between twelve and fifteen) is twenty-two times more likely to have a violent crime committed against him than an elderly white woman (over 65) and seven times more likely to have something stolen from him.
(Young and Lea 1984, p.26)
The 1988 BCS argues that Asians and Afro-Caribbeans were more likely to become the victims of crime but that this is:
largely explained by social and demographic factors, particularly the areas in which they live.
(Mayhew et al .
1989, p.50)
However, even discounting geographical reasons, ‘ethnic minority risks still tend to be higher’ with Asians more vulnerable to mugging and vandalism.
Of the ethnic minority population, 10.8 per cent had been the victims of assault as opposed to 5.5 per cent of whites.
Furthermore, Asians were more likely to be victimised by strangers, 27 per cent of the incidents involving groups of four or more offenders unknown to them.
Perhaps not surprisingly given this, they believed that crime against them was racially motivated.
Afro-Caribbeans were more likely to know the offender well and were more likely than Asians or whites to be victimised by other Afro-Asians.
The 1988 BCS also found that 70 per cent of personal property thefts happened at work, and that those in risk of assault were in entertainment, catering, nursing, welfare and security personnel.
Locality, class, race and gender are central in serious crime happening to a person.
We have seen that Asians and Afro-Caribbeans are likely to be assaulted more than whites (Asians twice as much as whites), and whilst we have statistics where white victims are ‘mugged’ by black assailants (a small part of robbery figures), we have no figures for street robbery, rape or racial assaults on black people by whites.
We know about black people as victims, but not about white people as perpetrators of crimes against black people.
We do have evidence that the first generation of Afro-Caribbean immigrants was exceptionally law abiding.
We have indications that black people have, over the past 30 years, become more present in the criminal statistics than the previous generation, reaching a level with, and in some categories, exceeding the indigenous population.
They certainly receive more custodial sentences than would normally be predicted from their presence in the population.
In the matter of stop-and-search powers and cautioning decisions there is evidence suggesting that a disproportionate amount of black young males are stopped by the police.
Black juveniles are more likely to be prosecuted and less likely to be cautioned than white juveniles.
Stephens and Willis (1979) noted that the chances of black youths being arrested for ‘other violent theft’ or ‘being a suspected person’were 14 and 15 times higher, respectively, than those of young white persons.
They argued that the apparent over-representation of black youth in the criminal statistics may be that youth is such a large part of the black population.
In 1971 the Runnymede Trust noted that 90 per cent of black Britons were under 15 years of age.
It is normal, then, to expect a high representation of black youth in youthful crime statistics.
The impoverished areas that black Britons settle in means that young people are far more at risk both in terms of levels of offending, and in terms of police surveillance.
Pitts (1986) notes that there is massive over-representation (up to 60 per cent of the inmate population) of black youth in remand and assessment centres (see also Fludger 1981).
He quotes Kettle (1982) who argued that according to the Home Office, 50 per cent of the population of Ashford remand centre were black, and for Brixton and Aylesbury prisons, remand prisoners were between 25 per cent and 35 per cent black.
This was true for Rochester, Dover and Hewell Grange Borstal and Balantyre House detention centre.
The implication is:
that as we move down the age range, so the proportion of young black inmates confined in custodial or child care institutions increases.
(Kettle 1982)
This has to be seen in the context that the fastest growing section of the penal population is the 15–25-year-old age group, and indeed the Young Offenders White Paper 1980, and the CJA 1982 are responses to this.
Indeed, nowhere is the problem of overcrowding in prison more acute than in this age group.
Several factors are involved in the process of black youth through the criminal justice system.
Taylor (1982) showed that in the Crown Court, black defendants are two or three times more likely to receive a custodial sentence.
The sentence is not related to the offence so much as whether the defendant is homeless, jobless, or has been the subject of a care order, and this is more likely to have happened to black youth.
Consequently, sentences for black  youth tend to move up tariff (receive too severe a sentence for the offence) in the criminal justice system too early on.
Where supervision orders to the probation service would normally have been made for the offence, we find that because of homelessness and unemployment, black youths tend to be remanded in custody, or given custodial sentences.
Pitts (1986) found that few black juveniles find their way to the IT schemes, or to day centres.
Instead, there has been a pressure for community homes for education for young black people who have been made the subject of care orders because of their offending.
Many of these institutions will keep their black intake down to 20 per cent.
There are consequently a large number of young black people in remand, observation and assessment centres.
Given that the CJA 1982 gave magistrates the powers of Youth Custody sentences of up to a year, and that these sentences increased by 67 per cent in the first year of its operation, it is hardly surprising that Taylor (1982) found that 43 per cent of black youth defendants opted for crown court trials.
It is further worth noting that the lack of confidence in the police by black people is now reaching other parts of the criminal justice system, notably the courts.
The Court of Appeal on 9 August 1989 found that a trial judge has no power to empanel a multiracial jury, even if he believes to do so would be right in the particular circumstances of the case.
A jury is believed to be selected randomly from the population, but for example, in a study of 326 juries in Birmingham from 1975–77, only 0.7 per cent of jurors were black, whilst the census suggested one should expect between 10 and 15 times that number.
A defence cannot challenge the composition of the whole panel on the ground of an inadequate number of the relevant racial group.
This must extend Taylor's (1982) findings of the suspicion by black defendants of magistrates courts, being extended now to crown courts.
Black defendants are three times more likely to receive a custodial sentence than whites.
This sentence Taylor found, does not reflect the seriousness of the offence, but correlates with homelessness, joblessness, and whether the defendant was subject of a care order.
Structural inequality affects the process of criminal justice, because black defendants lack material and structural support systems which would normally keep them out of prison.
Pitts (1986) quotes Midland Probation Service figures which indicate that the second highest category of offence resulting in arrest for young blacks are those arising from confrontation with the police, offences he notes, which occur after the police arrive.
Landau (1981) suggested that (before its repeal)‘sus’(arrest for being a suspected person) was the biggest difference in arrest rates between races, and that the police thought black youth more antagonistic to them, and they were 50 per cent more likely to be referred to the juvenile bureau.
Hence black youth is subject to closer surveillance and control by the police, a form of policing more likely to generate further  offences and more likely to be diverted to the juvenile bureau.
Willis (1983) found that black males aged between 16 and 24 were stopped ten times more than average (although prosecuted in the same proportion as white juveniles).
Landau and Nathan (1983) found that in the juvenile bureau of six London boroughs white juveniles were significantly more cautioned than black, including juveniles with previous convictions.
Pratt (1980) showed for Lambeth that young black men between 10 and 18 are the most likely perpetrators, but also the most likely victims of street crime.
The Policy Studies Institute (PSI)(Smith and Gray 1983) study of police and people in London found that the proportion stopped by the Metropolitan Police were 63 per cent of Afro-Caribbeans, 44 per cent for whites and 18 per cent for Asians, and that of those arrested 17 per cent were Afro-Caribbean.
The first figures published by the Home Office (Home Office 1986) indicated that of prisoners, 8 per cent of men and 12 per cent of women were Afro-Caribbean, yet these groups make up only 1 per cent and 2 per cent of the population in general(see also Walker 1987).
In 1983, the Metropolitan Police had claimed that 13 per cent of defendants were black (Home Office 1984).
Relatively, more black people were held in secure prisons.
Walker (1988), in a study which looked at the race of young males disposed of by the courts in London in 1983, found that of those prosecuted, more blacks had their case dismissed without trial due to insufficient evidence, suggesting according to Walker, that either ‘…the police more readily prosecute black people’, or that ‘the court requires more convincing evidence for black  defendants ’(Walker 1988, p.459).
Furthermore a higher proportion of blacks were acquitted after trial, which again suggests insufficient evidence.
Additionally, a slightly higher proportion of blacks were sentenced in adult rather than juvenile magistrates courts and of these a higher proportion of blacks were tried in the crown courts.
Of those sentenced in the crown courts proportionately more black defendants received a custodial sentence.
The situation does not appear to have altered dramatically since then.
The Home Office Statistical Bulletin 6/89 (Home Office 1989c) found black defendants were more likely to be remanded in custody than white defendants, yet a higher proportion were subsequently acquitted.
Compared to their numbers in the general population, black men are 8 times, and black women 6 times over-represented in the prison population.
An examination of magistrates courts revealed that for the under-21 population, black youth on average received 12 months imprisonment, whilst white youth only 9 months for similar offences.
The NACRO Briefing (1989a) which provides a useful review of research into racism in the criminal justice system found that there:
is strong evidence that black people are unfairly treated by the criminal justice system.
(NACRO 1989a, p. 14)
Commenting on the numbers from ethnic minorities in prison, Vivien Stern, the director of NACRO went straight to the point when she suggested:
these figures do not show that black people are more prone crime, but they do suggest that black people who offend are more likely to go to prison.
(Daily Telegraph 13.6.88)
Of the 48,609 people in prison in September 1989, 9173 (18.9 per cent) were from ethnic minorities, rising from 6000 in 1985 (Lord Errars in a written answer to House of Lords question 3 March 1990, quoted in NACRO News Digest May 1990).
Of the 36,496 sentenced male prisoners on the same date, 3,629 (9.9 per cent) were Afro-Caribbean, 1,059 (2.9 per cent ) were Indian, Pakistani or  Bangladeshi and 667 (1.8 per cent ) of Chinese, Arab or mixed origins (ibid).
For all types of custody the proportion of all ethnic minorities in the prison population was higher than in the general population.
Black prisoners had fewer previous convictions than white prisoners sentenced for the same type of offence and were less likely to be granted bail.
Black youth were more likely to be prosecuted and less likely to be cautioned than white youth.
A study of juvenile sentencing in Hackney between 1984–86 (Tipler 1986) found that blacks were twice as likely to receive custodial sentences as whites for similar offences.
An analysis of custodial sentences passed on juveniles in North London in 1985–86 (Green et al .
1987) found that black youth received longer sentences and that the black Afro-Caribbean youths given custodial sentences had fewer previous convictions than their white counterparts.
A Home Office study (HO 1/89) which looked at probationers in 1984 found that of some 110,000 people on probation, only 4 per cent were black, 2 per cent were Asian and 1 per cent were ‘other’.
Gilroy (1987) has taken issue with the common reading of criminal statistics and black people.
He points out that most ignore the astonishing number of racist attacks which are part of the everyday life of black people in many of the inner city areas, and that the police in such areas are notoriously selective in their surveillance of black people.
The police, in common with other members of the white population, he argues, see black British life as characterised by pathological family relations and generational conflict.
Black crime is presented as biological culturalism in Conservative thought, and as a cultural problem in by the left, who speak of deprivation and restricted opportunity.
This, Gilroy argues, overlooks the multiracial character of what occurred in the 1981 and 1985 youth riots, and relegates British urban street crime to an Afro-Caribbean deviation.
Gilroy points out  that rising street crime has been used as a justification for increased police militarisation, and blames this rise on the deviant activities of a minority of black youth.
An annual symbol of this relationship is the policing of the Notting Hill Carnival.
However, it is the continued surveillance, the feeling of lack of police protection from organised and spontaneous racist attacks upon black persons and property that have led to the breakdown in police/black community relations.
It is not that police statistics are misleading on recorded crime, but they need to be considered in the context of the BCS and the local crime surveys.
They need to be compared to the evidence of such documents such as the Institute of Race Relations ‘Policing against Black People’ with its accounts of police harassment, assault and deaths in custody, and the Anti-Fascist journal Searchlight's files on racial assaults on black people by the civilian population.
Gilroy reminds us that black political protest in the streets and urban crime have very successfully become fused in the public eye.
The black population has been under police surveillance for a long time.
Sivanandan (1982) noted that in 1975, for example, the Metropolitan Special Patrol Group stopped and interrogated 14,000 people on the streets.
Lea (1986), in a discussion of police racism, suggests that a common theory of apologists for the police force is the ‘bad apple’ approach which views the problem as one of individual officers being bigoted.
This can tie into the occupational or ‘canteen culture’ explanation of police racism, which in the words of the Policy Studies Institute (Smith and Gray 1983) suggests that racialist talk:
helps to reinforce the security and solidarity of the group against a clearly perceived external threat.
(Smith and Gray 1983, p. 127)
This view puts the dynamic of police racism in the norms and values through which the police define their roles and legitimate their activities.
However, Lea points out that for writers like Gilroy racism is embodied in the conscious policies and practices of the police as an institution and that it is difficult to argue that the police are de-politicising black struggles, and criminalising them, when some of them, such as the Spaghetti House siege, used crime to obtain political funds, and hence the police responded to the event as crime.
However, what this assumes is that the police never make decisions to de-politicise crime, which they plainly do in their endeavour to argue that many assaults by whites upon black are not racist in their intent, merely matters of public order.
By positing the issue of black crime as a central feature of law and order, the black community becomes viewed as a potentially violent and lawless group.
The large proportion of law-abiding black people, for example, black  health and social services workers, becomes subsumed under an association of black people and deviance.
Certain crimes become symbols of the ethnicity of those who carry them out.
Black communities become sites of struggle, defended on the one hand by black youth, and attacked on the other by the police, determined to prevent ‘no-go’ areas as in Northern Ireland.
What can be seen is that the attempt to correlate black youth and crime is a latent but definite element in the law and order debate.
Its complexity makes it the rock upon which the left realist argument has foundered.
Left realism is not intentionally racist, but it has been responded to as such, because of the complex element of police racism.
What has been left out of the argument is that racism is tragically too common to black people.
For example, in some districts in Central London, black children have to be escorted to school to defend them from assault; white estates have deliberately driven out black tenants.
Racism like this is not faced by whites, and is only too everyday for black people in a highly xenophobic society, and this has terrible effects on their everyday lives.
UNEMPLOYMENT AND CRIME: A DIGRESSION
We believe unemployment to be among the causes of ill-health, mortality, crime and civil disorder.
(House of Lords Select Committee on Unemployment, May 1982)
In a sense we do not really need to ask the question ‘Does unemployment cause crime?’ or ‘Do the under-privileged offend more than privileged.’
The debate about whether unemployment, poverty and deprivation are causally related to crime is perhaps less interesting than the observation which we discussed more fully elsewhere that crime, and in particular, street crime, becomes highlighted during times of economic crisis.
While agreeing with, if not the language, the sentiments of Taylor that:
Crime in general is not, therefore, a product of worklessness but a product of the way in which a capitalist mode of production sets man against man and ‘systematically’ prioritizes individual self interest as rational social practice.
But especially in conditions of capitalist crisis, it is only the street crime of the poor which is identified as a danger to the social order.
(Taylor 1982, p. 10)
Nevertheless, with the prominence given again and again to assertions that unemployment and crime are unrelated we must, at least briefly, review the arguments.
The orthodox sociological position, which may be derived from various different theoretical perspectives, is that rising unemployment leads to more crime.
This proposition has been the subject of much empirical debate, but at present there seems no overwhelming consensus as to its veracity.
Reviews of the existing work may be found in Box and Hale (1986) and, at more length, in Box (1987, Chapter Five).
More recent studies using British data do, however, support the argument.
In work which addresses the impact of the  Women's Liberation Movement on female crime rates, Box and Hale (1984) found that increases in the rate of female unemployment were significantly related to increases in the rate of conviction for violent crime (assault and wounding), theft, handling stolen goods and fraud.
Farrington et al .,
(1986), from the Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development, showed that members of the cohort of London youth being studied were more likely to commit offences when out of work than when employed.
Sampson and Wooldredge (1987), made elegant use of the data from the 1982 British Crime Survey and found that the probability of burglary victimisation and household theft victimisation increased with the rate of local unemployment.
When personal thefts and larcenies were considered, unemployment was statistically insignificant.
However, when the personal thefts were restricted to those which occurred within 15 minutes' walk of the victim's home, unemployment was again a statistically significant factor.
This study goes at least some way towards overcoming the problems of other work discussed by Box and Hale (1986, pp. 74–5), in that it relies on self-reported victimisation rather than police figures on recorded crime, and it controls for other socio-demographic variables.
In work using cross-section data for England and Wales, Pyle (1987, 1989) argues that the deterrence effect of the Conservative's policy of increased expenditure on the police and tougher sentences for convicted criminals has been swamped by the massive increases in unemployment during their period of government.
Pyle (1982) examined age-specific groups, unemployment and recorded property offences for the year 1975.
The results, he believed, ‘support the view that increases in unemployment are likely to significantly increase recorded property crime rates (most notably robberies)’(p.15).
Carr-Hill and Stern (1979) are usually quoted as providing clear evidence that unemployment and crime are not related.
Their work, which combines census data with other cross-section information for the 3 years 1961, 1966 and 1971, uses econometric techniques to estimate an interdependent model of crime rates and police activity.
However, Hakim (1982) re-analysed the data and found that ‘the results…confirm the association between crime and  unemployment, and suggest it has been increasing over time’(p.453).
The reason for the conflicting conclusions is, Hakim suggests, because:
a careful reading of this study (Carr-Hill and Stern) shows that the authors never carried out the test in question…but instead test the contribution of unemployment to explaining the number of police per capita in each area.
In effect the authors reject the hypothesis about unemployment contributing to crime on theoretical (or subjective) grounds, but they imply that they tested it fully.
However, they are unable to sidestep the results that show that areas with a high proportion of young men aged 15–24 years and a high proportion of the working class have significantly higher crime rates — and both these groups have the highest levels of unemployment experiences.
(Hakim 1982: 452)
Lord Scarman (1981), in providing the social background to the Brixton disorders of 10–12 April 1981, was at pains to point out that deprivations do not justify attacks on the police or excuse such disorders.
But at no stage did he deny that these conditions are part of the explanation.
Indeed, amongst the deprivations he lists, unemployment figures prominently.
It stood at 13 per cent in Brixton in early 1981 and ‘for black people, the percentage is estimated to be higher (around 25 per cent)’.
Furthermore, young blacks were even more affected, for ‘unemployment among black males under 19 has been estimated at 55 percent’.
(Scarman 1981: p.27).
Indeed, the view that unemployment and crime are related has not always been anathema to the Tories.
In 1976 in the Conservative Monthly News Lord Whitelaw was clearly of the opinion that ‘Undoubtedly, economic mismanagement…where it leads to high levels of unemployment, especially amongst young people, also contributes considerably to increasing the number of those tempted into a criminal life.
’ Less convincingly, perhaps, he continued: ‘The only real remedy for this situation is a vigorous pursuit of Conservative economic and social policies.’
Nor does the view represent the position of some police spokespersons.
For example, at the Police Federation's Annual Conference in 1987 the leader of the constables' section told delegates that:
Decrepit housing, poorly designed estates and unemployment make our job that much more difficult, in that people become more despondent.
(Independent 20.5. 1987)
Earlier, in 1984, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cree had linked youth unemployment with the increase in crime and drug addiction in the London Borough of Southwark.
In a letter to Harriet Harman MP, reported in the Guardian , he wrote:
I do not think there is any doubt that high unemployment is related to high crime rates in certain parts of the borough.
What is even more disturbing is the proven connection between unemployment, crime and the purchase and sale of illegal drugs, both the hard and soft varieties.
(Guardian 24.3.84)
We would not wish the preceding argument to be read as suggesting that unemployment is the only independent variable which affects crime.
Such a view would clearly be banal.
Indeed, work published by the Home Office (Field 1990) suggests that other indicators may capture the effect of economic conditions better than unemployment.
In a sophisticated analysis of the variation of crime rates, Field found that, for property crimes in particular, personal consumption was an important correlate.
When spending power goes up relatively quickly the long-term growth in property crime slows down.
When personal consumption becomes static or declines, property crime rates take off:
In England and Wales the relationship has held throughout the 20th century, and has been particularly strong in the last twenty years….
A similar association between property crime and consumption may be demonstrated for the United States, Japan and France.
(Field 1990, p.5)
For crimes of sex and violence, but not domestic violence, he found the opposite effect.
Violence was the only crime for which he found any link with unemployment.
Domestic violence like property offences tended to increase when times were hard.
The importance of this work is that it puts economic factors firmly back on the agenda as explanations of crime.
Clearly it flies against the conventional wisdom of the Conservative Government who, as we have already seen, prefer to blame slack parental control or moral fibre.
Indeed, at the Home Office Press Conference held to discuss the catastrophic crime figures for April to June 1990, John Patten attempted to distance himself from the research by asking if Field was the member of his staff ‘who wore an earring’(Guardian 27.10.90) before stating that the work was exploratory and could not be regarded as definitive.
We conclude by noting that Young (1987), in a paper which attacks the one-sided partiality of much criminological theory, is rightly critical of what he calls the adversarial positivism which characterises the debate over unemployment and crime.
He argues that crime is likely to increase when one or more of the following conditions predominate:
When State deterrence is less effective.
Where informal social control is reduced.
Where State and/or public definitions of crime become less tolerant.
When the number of those motivated to offend increases.
When the number of victims and targets increases.
We would suggest that in times of economic crisis and recession several of these conditions are indeed likely to predominate and that in fact they did during the 1980s in the UK.
This is not the same as arguing that unemployment will always, inevitably and inexorably, produce more crime.
In a society which took seriously its responsibility for the economic and social welfare of all its members this might not happen.
But in a society where the official rate of unemployment doubled between 1979 and 1981, from 5.3 per cent to 10.4 per cent and reached over 3.5 million or nearly 15 per cent during 1986, where the Government, in the name of the market, is committed to weakening the ability of workers to defend their jobs, where the Government, in its desire to break what it sees as the ‘dependency culture’, has systematically set about dismantling the welfare provisions which protected the poorest and weakest in society, where the Government, as part of its programme to establish a new thrusting entrepreneurial society, has encouraged a widening of differentials in income and wealth, we would expect the societal tensions produced to be expressed in, among other things, rising levels of crime.
Fraud
White collars and grey areas
As the Sundance Kid said to Butch Cassidy, as they were being hotly pursued by a posse of Pinkerton detectives ‘If they paid me to stop raiding banks, what they paid them to stop me robbing banks, I'd stop robbing banks.’
(Box 1987, p.201)
Conservative criminology concentrates on crimes committed by those it considers members of the dangerous classes, those who are seen as part, either of the criminal underworld, or of the lumpenproletariat .
Thus offences such as the traditional petty or grand crimes, welfare swindles, theft by young males, burglary and street crime (in itself a rather vague term) dominate both popular and academic conservative discourses on criminality.
A complaint made by radical criminology against its conservative counterpart is that it has ignored upper-world crime: fraud, corporate crime and white-collar crime.
Care must be taken not to confuse corporate crime, crime committed by or on behalf of businesses, with white-collar crime, which refers to the occupational status of the perpetrators and may often be directed against businesses.
Whilst the issue of ‘crimes of the powerful’, to use Pearce's (1976) evocative phrase, is now often portrayed as a left-wing cliche, this does not make it any the less a problem.
An ideology of greed and selfishness, passed off as self-sufficiency, and of untrammelled individual aspirations passed off as ambition, cannot fail to have an effect upon upper-world crime.
Several notorious cases, involving either fraud or neglect of health and safety legislation have, however, forced a usually reluctant conservative criminology to face the issues of corporate crime.
These crimes can be seen as natural extensions of an ideology where the urge to individualise success and profit is the preferred avenue of advancement.
In this book space prevents us from paying more than cursory attention to the whole area of upper-world crime.
We feel this important, however, to counterbalance the view of crime, promoted by the Conservative Party, and accepted by some on the left, as being nothing more than violence, mugging and burglary.
Obviously, fraud is a somewhat grey area, in the sense that it covers a spectrum of activities ranging from wilful bare-faced swindles to sharp business practices involving dubious accountancy.
It may, for example, involve liquidation fraud, where a company voluntarily goes into liquidation to avoid its responsibilities.
Encouraged by the spirit of the enterprise culture this was so prevalent by 1985 that the Insolvency Act of 1985 was set up to control liquidation fraudsters, and mainly involved asset stripping.
One problem with analysing fraud is that the official statistics do not record the class or occupation of the offender, nor the detail of the offence.
This means that an offence categorised as fraud, can include company crimes, minor embezzlements and major swindles, ranging from small-time scams on the street to sophisticated computer fraud.
Approximately 50 years ago, the Metropolitan Police Fraud Squad was set up to deal with the then growing incidence of company fraud.
Twenty years later saw the creation of provincial fraud squads.
By the 1960s fraud became to be recognised as a major criminal problem, but the fraud squads were hampered by small staffing levels, and their access to an unofficial nucleus of specialist fraud lawyers was slow to develop.
In 1961 recorded fraud cases numbered 39,651 of a total of 806,900 crimes, and by 1986 this had increased by 210 per cent to 122,802 of 3,857,400 by 1986.
Total recorded figures on these offences have increased by 378 per cent, but in 1981 fraud was 4.9 per cent of total crime, and in 1986 3.18 per cent of the total.
It is worth emphasising again the ‘dark’ statistics of unreported crime, which is particularly relevant here where it has been estimated that 70 per cent of computer crime is unreported, because of the fear of loss of public confidence in the financial institutions concerned.
In 1985 company fraud was calculated to cost 3 billion a year, with half of British companies being affected.
Levi's survey (Levi 1986) put the figure at 1 billion losses, with recorded offences rising annually at 5 per cent, and the Confederate of British Industry estimates that computer crime runs at an annual figure of 25 to 30 million.
Levi (1987) found that commercial fraud recorded by the London fraud squads represented nearly three times the total cost of all property crimes in London, and that 40 per cent of companies in the survey reported at least one fraud costing over 50,000.
WHITE-COLLAR CRIME, FRAUD AND ITS CONTROL
Corporate crime
Because of the more visible appearance, combined with several major scandals, of corporate crime, it is an area which the Thatcher Government has been forced to address.
There are two aspects to corporate crime, firstly  commercial crime, including fraud, and secondly a spin-off from criminal activities, the laundering of money by organised crime, in particular that involving drugs.
The 1984 PACE Act, the 1987 Criminal Justice Act (which set up the Serious Fraud Office) and the Criminal Justice Act of 1988 all contained measures which strengthened legal powers to investigate fraud.
The setting up of the Serious Fraud Office was an important development, as were the increased powers of the Department of Trade and Industry under the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Companies Act 1985.
The political context of this is well discussed in Levi (1987, Chapters 4 and 5) who argues that with the proposed deregulation of our prime export earner, the insurance, money and securities market, Britain has to be seen by prospective investors to have the power to eliminate financial fraud.
By 1986 employment in the financial service industries had increased by one-fifth since 1979, and income by one-third, in contrast to the manufacturing and construction industries where employment was down by one-quarter, whilst wages increased only one-seventh.
Another area of major concern to the police and the judiciary is drug smuggling and the methods used to deal with the huge profits it generates.
Previously the law was such that punishment by fines and imprisonment left the capital and income of the traffickers untouched.
Consequently, this was curbed by an attack on the laundering of money earned by drug dealers, through banks, corporate ownership and securities transactions.
Under the provisions of PACE, the police now have powers to search for evidence prior to charging a suspect.
This includes obtaining access through a judge, prior to charging a suspect, to bank accounts and other documentary evidence.
Indeed, where the bank or other party refuses to co-operate and the offence is serious, or is likely to lead to substantial financial gain or loss to any person, the same act allows the police to search for evidence which has the intention of furthering a criminal purpose, and in such cases this provision overrides legal privilege.
However as Levi points out, different official agencies use these powers in a manner which is related to the level of tolerance they expect from the media and politicians.
DSS officials are far more vigorous in handling suspect benefit claimants than is the Inland Revenue in dealing with suspected tax evasion.
The agencies dealing with business and corporate elites tend to employ a more co-operative mode than those dealing with the poor.
Drug profits have also been affected by provisions in the Drug Trafficking Offences Act 1986 (Section 24), which makes assisting drug trafficking an offence, and also provides immunity from breach of contract where it is disclosed to the police that funds or investments are derived from drug trafficking.
Great consternation was felt in banking circles, who felt they could be implicated, and less draconian measures to deal with the matter were  brought in under the CJA 1988, which allows the waiving of civil liabilities if banks inform the police of suspicions of fraud or drug trafficking in good faith.
For Levi this is an indicator that:
the state is extending its intelligence-gathering capabilities into the upper world as well as the under world and the lumpenproletariat.
(Levi 1989, p.194)
There have been some dramatic prosecutions of commercial fraud, or what may be seen as criminal negligence.
This includes the senior members of Morgan Grenfell, Johnson Matthey Bankers, Guinness, Lloyds and Barlow Clowes, all apparent bastions of the establishment of the City of London.
The catalogue of suspect financial deals in the 1980s included such cause celebres as the Fayed brothers, takeover of the House of Fraser, and the sale of the Rover Group to British Aerospace.
Perhaps the most infamous example of the new buccaneering spirit abroad in British boardrooms was the Guinness affair.
Whilst the zealous pursuit of the villains in the case is trumpeted as an indication of the Establishment's hard line on corporate criminality, it should be remembered that the conspiracy was only discovered as a result of the work of the US Securities and Exchange Commission during their investigation of the Wall Street insider dealer Ivan Boesky.
The trial during the summer of 1990 of four wealthy and supposedly respectable members of the business and financial community revealed the extent of boardroom greed.
In order to support the Guinness share price during its takeover of the Distillers Group criminal acts of theft, false accountancy and conspiracy were committed.
The pay-offs were enormous.
Gerald Ronson's Heron Group received 5 million for its illegal support of the shares whilst Anthony Barnes and Sir Jack Lyons each had 3 million paid into private Swiss bank accounts.
Against these sums the sentences imposed on the defendants appear modest when compared to less successful white-collar criminals.
During 1990 the Appeal Court upheld prison sentences of 6 years for a confidence trickster who raised barely 1000, 7 years for a man who obtained 36,000 using fraudulent cheques, and 12 years for a Post Office employee who defrauded his employer of 136,000 (Guardian 29.8.90).
When dismissing Mr Ronson's appeal against his 5 million fine the judge commented that:
Although it would seem an enormous sum to ordinary people it was a comparatively run-of-the mill sum to Mr. Ronson.
(The Times 3.10.90)
During the original trial Ronson's defence counsel emphasised his client's integrity on several occasions, a fact which the trial judge found difficult to reconcile with his criminal behaviour concluding it must have ‘been a moment of greed’.
Surprisingly, for a man of such integrity, Mr Ronson  appealed against the fine on the grounds that his wealth was only 10.7 million, an amount which the judge dismissed derisively as ‘an artificial evaluation done for the purposes of sentencing’.
Whatever one's opinions of their sentences there is no doubt that the defendants received much gentler treatment than less distinguished offenders.
Ernest Saunders' organised media campaign, which included regular Fess briefings, would surely have brought ordinary criminals before the judge for contempt.
Again the response to the violent forging through the press and public outside the court by the accused's ‘minders’ had they been the heavies of more traditional villains is open to speculation.
The crimes of the respectable are viewed more sympathetically than those of miscreants from humbler backgrounds.
In the same week as the verdicts in the Guinness trial the Department of Trade and Industry published a report into the Lloyds' insurance market which suggested that big frauds were almost impossible to prevent:
We recognise that when a number of intelligent and ingenious individuals in the most senior positions, but bereft of commercial morality and intent on personal gain, set out together to rob and to deceive, it is extremely difficult to ensure they will be deterred or exposed, before much damage is caused.
(Department of Trade and Industry 1990)
This conclusion underlines yet again that there are wicked people, whereas a more structural analysis of this would perhaps see the behaviour as a logical extension of the search for profits.
In the words of the Guardian :
The Government investigations paint a picture of decadent fraud flourishing in a climate of lax controls dating back to the 19th century and policed by professional advisors who paid insufficient attention to the task at hand.
(Guardian 1.9.90)
The report is a remarkable admission that despite tightening of Lloyds' regulations such frauds will continue.
The subjects of the investigation, the Alexander Howden and PCW frauds, together involved more than $100 million of investors' money.
The offences only came to light because of an attempt to inflate profits at Alexander Howden, which was discovered by the American company Alexander and Alexander after it bought the company.
The report accepted that, without this, the frauds would not have come to light and that there were probably other, undetected, offences.
Although criminal proceedings were brought in the Alexander Howden case, no prosecutions have followed the PCW affair where $50 million was siphoned away from Lloyds' investors, and related underwriting losses were estimated  at 230 million.
The scam involved a series of bogus re-insurance deals and the DTI inspectors found:
no mitigating circumstances to excuse a condone the systematic, dishonest and cynical plunder of the Names' (investors') premium over such a period of time and on such a scale.
(Department of Trade and Industry 1990)
The Guinness case and the PCW affair are hardly calculated to inspire confidence in the notion of self-regulation for the financial and commercial world.
In both cases the information which led to the discovery of wrongdoing came from outside the UK.
Indeed one commentator has gone so far as to describe the DTI's performance in these cases coupled with its sloppiness in the Barlow Clowes affair and failure to press prosecution over the House of Fraser takeover as ‘part of a lengthy and dishonourable supine tradition’(Alex Brummer,Guardian , 28.8.90).
Nor are the problems confined to the  rarefied atmosphere of corporate boardrooms.
In August 1990, the Securities Association, the self-regulatory body covering share dealers and advisers, acted for the first time against a broker found guilty of ‘churning’ his clients' portfolios.
This involves brokers generating income by constantly and needlessly buying and selling investments for their clients in order to collect the heavy commissions which accrue.
It is virtually impossible to prove because guilty brokers tend to ‘churn’ the portfolios of inexperienced clients.
The Security Association suggests that the responsibility for monitoring this swindle lies with the clients:
There is no cut-off point above which ‘churning’ may be considered to be unacceptable, so clients have to watch their portfolios carefully.
(Money Guardian 1.9.90)
It is not only in the world of high finance that fraud has occurred.
Conservative economic policy ironically has created social conditions which have led to increased crime amongst the middle as well as working classes.
The Association of British Insurers reported in September 1990 an annual increase in business fire insurance claims of 25 per cent.
A sizeable proportion of these cases were suspected arson and were related to increased business failure because of high interest rates.
We can see that the Government law and order policy has been irrelevant to all crime, including upper-world crime, and indeed that its social and economic policy has caused the crime rate to rise.
Box (1987) argues that crimes committed by corporations, businesses and professions are likely to increase in times of economic recession although he admits that the evidence is less strong than for ‘conventional’ crimes (see Chapter Four).
The anti-collective, individualistic morality of the pursuit of money in the enterprise culture has led to a belief by some speculators that they can take risks which are criminal.
This is either with other people's money, or with the lives and safety of the employees.
Profit has been seen as more pursuable than collective concern for others.
TAX EVASION AND WELFARE FRAUD
There are 30 — 40 times more prosecutions for social security frauds than for tax offences.
The Department of Social Security (DSS) considers 250 to be the amount at which prosecution becomes cost-effective.
In contrast, few criminal proceedings are brought for lack of compliance or evasion in the tax world.
The Inland Revenue does not need to prosecute because they have powers to exert penalties similar to a fine, and basically they want to get the money back.
Levi (1987) argues that the caution exercised by the Inland Revenue is in marked contrast to the enthusiasm of the DSS, a view shared by Uglow (1988b) and Cook,(1989).
Obviously the way in which powers are used by different agencies, such as the Inland Revenue, DSS or the police, depend largely to the support they feel they will receive from the media, the Government and the public.
A major and highly publicised target has been the welfare ‘scroungers’, whether these are young people allegedly on the ‘Costa del Dole ‘, looking for seasonal casual work in seaside towns, or those who are claiming while working.
‘Welfare scroungers’ perform an important ideological function as symbols for those who the Welfare State has encouraged to exploit the system rather than fend for themselves.
‘Scroungers’ expect something for nothing from the Welfare State, rather than offering a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.
As such they are seen as antithetical to the work ethic which has been such an integral part of Thatcherite political rhetoric.
Young claimants who refuse demeaning or underpaid work necessarily fall into this group.
They are often dealt with by a system which attempts to get them off benefit, rather than prosecute.
It is often difficult to differentiate those who deliberately commit fraud from those who are confused in their claims.
Welfare fraud is an ideologically emotional topic, because it is usually expressed in terms of aggregated amounts (Uglow 1988b).
(5200 over 24 months sounds far worse than 50 per week.
One traditionally impoverished group — women — have become more represented in this offence than elsewhere in criminal statistics.
Explained, no doubt, by Conservatives not by their drive to break the ‘dependency culture ‘, whatever the human cost, or the low levels of pay for women workers, but moral inadequacy which has led to the breakdown of families and the high incidence of single mothers.
The person who is suspected of welfare fraud is more likely to be detected, prosecuted, convicted and to receive a custodial sentence than those involved in a wide range of other forms of non-violent property offences, including fraud and tax evasion (Uglow 1988b).
Welfare fraud squads have increased for example from 800 to 1,500 in the last few years, and in 1983 the regional fraud teams (10 groups of 9) were developed, saving, it was argued in 1987, 55 million.
Dispatch riders, hotel workers, mini cab drivers and building trade workers were targeted (Guardian , 1.6.88).
Throughout the 1980s there were drives to recruit more specialist fraud staff.
By 1985 there were 1,512 specialist fraud officers in benefits offices, as well as another 112 officers working in the specialist claims control (SCC).
The techniques were criticised, and the SCC system was replaced by regional benefit fraud teams, in 1986, when another 600 fraud staff were recruited.
On 1 June 1988 the Department of Employment (DoE) reported that during 1987–88 DoE staff had made 396,200 investigations, leading to 80,000 people withdrawing their claims to benefit (Unemployment Bulletin 1988) saving 55 million in the year.
Behind this announcement is the political point emphasised in the February 1988 White Paper, the short-and-long term unemployed who are ‘respectable’ must be differentiated from the sign on and work ‘unrespectable’.
The same report re-announced the prosecutions of specific groups (street traders, casual workers, mini cab drivers and despatch riders in London, the South Coast, Birmingham and Scotland) with the suggestion that a larger number of claimants are involved than those who come to the courts.
However, in 1987–88 only 3,960 prosecutions occurred, or 1 per cent of the total of 396,200 investigations, or 5 per cent of the total of 80,000 withdrawals from the register, and less than 0.1 per cent of the 4,390,200 claims for that year.
An investigation is considered successful if the claimant signs off within 2 weeks of being contacted by an investigation officer, but it is hard to differentiate these from those who would have signed off anyway.
The estimated savings are based on the claimant being 22 weeks off the register, but again some stay off for a year, and some return much sooner.
The savings figure, then, is highly speculative, but it is certainly good publicity for the department.
During the same period the numbers of Inland Revenue staff were declining, by some 20 per cent to 68,000 in 1987.
There are several specialist groups for business, subcontractors, large-scale tax avoidance and transfer of assets overseas.
The Keith Report (1983) estimated losses due to tax evasion at 7 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product, around 15 billion, and tax loss at 4 billion, roughly 15 times the amount of welfare abuse.
Interestingly, the close scrutiny of tax returns is less likely than detailed examination of supplementary benefit (now income support) claims, which of course is much simpler.
The number of social security prosecutions has declined, having halved by 1984.
There is an attempt often to stop illegal claiming, rather than prosecute.
Prosecutions occur, as we noted above when overpayment exceeds 250.
This should be compared with Customs and Excise policy to prosecute for VAT fraud when the amount exceeds 75,000 (Uglow 1988b).
There were 9,487 prosecutions for welfare fraud in 1987–88, of which about 28 per cent were conducted by the police.
Again prosecution is clearly aimed at the undeserving poor.
Because nearly everyone pays taxes but not everyone claims welfare, there is a feeling that tax evasion is fair game.
The Inland Revenue attempts to maximise revenue, and are prepared to negotiate terms with tax offenders.
Tax fraud work brings in 1.6 billion p.a but the criminal justice system is seldom used (472 in 1987).
The case against the comedian Ken Dodd in August 1989, and the earlier conviction of the former champion jockey Lester Piggott, highlighted the different public attitudes towards welfare and tax fraud.
After a long deliberation by the jury, Mr Dodd was cleared of wilfully avoiding tax on the considerable sums of money he had hidden, but had to pay large amounts of tax considered owing, as well as legal costs.
The affair seemed only to add to his status as folk hero.
The conviction rate for social security offences is approximately 95 per cent, mostly guilty pleas.
For other frauds the rate is about 77 per cent.
Again with welfare fraud, the appeal court has refused to recognise there must be dishonesty or intent to defraud (Barrass v Reeve (1980)).
Welfare convictions attract longer sentences than other summary offences (Uglow 1988b).
However, when tax cases do reach the courts convicted tax dodgers, such as Lester Piggott, receive relatively severe sentences even in comparison with welfare fraud convictions.
The sums involved, however, are much higher, and, as we noted, the prosecutions less likely.
The disparity is in the prosecution policies, not the sentencing (McEwan 1980).
HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS: ‘SAFETY STANDARDS ARE BEING DICTATED BY ACCOUNTANTS’
A series of disasters involving public safety travelling or spectating at sports stadiums have occurred since 1985.
In each case there were criticisms that each could have been prevented by better safety measures and checking.
At the Bradford football stadium disaster on 11 May 1985, 56 fans were killed when a stand burnt down.
The Popplewell report into the disaster concluded that it could easily have been prevented.
It found that the Health and Safety Executive, West Yorkshire County Council, the Fire Brigade and Bradford City football club were all aware of the fire hazard caused by years of accumulated rubbish, yet nothing was done to eliminate it.
A second major disaster at a football game occurred on 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, when 95 football fans were killed and 175  badly injured, when they were unable to escape from overcrowded terracing because of the perimeter fencing.
The Taylor report found some responsibility for the tragedy lay with the stadium's management, some with the fans and some with the South Yorkshire police, and suggested that senior officers had been dubious witnesses.
It specifically blamed the failure of police control.
Senior officers did not even visit the ground before approving the ground control plan, and the club was criticised for lack of rescue and medical equipment, and inadequate signposting to steer any latecomers away from full terraces.
The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Peter Wright, offered to resign, but this was refused by the South Yorkshire Police Authority.
The West Midlands Force were instructed to investigate the South Yorkshire Police, ironically, at a time when their own Serious Crimes Squad was the subject of an investigation.
There have been a number of tragedies involving the travelling public.
At Manchester Airport on 25 August 1985, a British Airtours charter jet crashed as it prepared for take-off.
The inquiry said economic pressures for more seating had impeded escape from the aircraft, and among its recommendations was to change the materials used in the construction of seats — 48 of the 55 dead were killed by smoke and toxic gases.
On 21 December 1989, at Lockerbie all 259 passengers and crew on a Pan Am jumbo going to New York were killed by a bomb.
This was Britain's worst air tragedy, and whilst this cannot be classified as an accident in the usual sense of the word, there were calls for greater airport security, and considerable concern over whether a warning that an attack would be made on an American airliner had not been passed onto the public because a drop in seat sales would occur.
On 8 January 1989, at Kegworth, 47 people were killed when a British Midland 737 crashed while attempting an emergency landing.
More than 1,500 people died in civilian air crashes throughout the world, little more than average for the decade.
Pilots have complained that airlines force them to work long hours, new jets are being grounded or sent back to the manufacturers for modification, and the government has been attacked for a series of embarrassing lapses at major airports.
In an increasingly competitive climate, airlines and manufacturers are under pressure to put profit ahead of safety.
Official statistics indicate that the potentially dangerous near misses involving civil and military aircraft has increased from 80 in 1979 to 92 in 1988, but the risk has declined, because of the increase in volume of civil traffic.
Britain's congested airline traffic has increased since 1979 from 180,000 to 655,000 per annum.
Bill Brett, general secretary of the Institution of Professional Civil Servants, which includes air traffic controllers and transport safety inspectors declared his concern over the cuts in the safety inspectorate over the recent years, and growing pressure on overworked air traffic controllers coping with increased traffic.
He suggested:
Public transport is less safe than it was.
It is the burden of a non regulatory government which is only interested in the private sector.
(Guardian 22.8.89)
Rail accidents were plentiful.
Four people were killed when a train plunged into a flooded Welsh river on 19 October 1987, at Glanrhyd.
British Rail (BR) accepted responsibility, and the inquest jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing.
The Welsh Water Authority issued a Red 2 flood warning, and BR's Swindon control centre telexed Swansea that it would be ‘probably imprudent’ to allow the train's departure.
One hour later it crashed into the river.
At King's Cross on 18 November 1988, 31 people were killed when a fire rapidly spread through the Underground ticket hall.
The Fennell inquiry said London Underground senior management had ‘narrow horizons and a dangerous, blinkered self-sufficiency’, being unwilling to take outside advice.
Safety officers (described as voices in the wilderness) had for years reported poor electrical wiring in escalator rooms, but no action was taken.
Staff were unsupervised, untrained and ill-equipped to deal with fire.
It argued that outbreaks of fire in Underground stations were seen as inevitable by management, which monitored strictly financial matters, rather than safety.
At Clapham on 12 December 1988, 35 people were killed in a triple train crash.
An inquiry heard that the disaster was ‘wholly avoidable’, and BR was criticised for failing to check that proper safety measures were carried out.
Technicians were criticised for defective workmanship on vital signalling equipment, lack of checks on work and lack of proper testing.
A factor in this was excessive overtime with many signalmen working 7 days a week for a month.
A working culture which allows excessive overtime encourages sub-standard work, and poor inspection.
The Director of Public Prosecutions decided that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute BR for manslaughter or any other offence, even though the inquiry concluded that working standards and supervision had slipped to unacceptable and dangerous levels.
Management had ‘failed abysmally to ensure work was of the proper standard’.
At Purley on 4 March 1989, five people were killed and 87 injured after a crash, and a BR internal inquiry blamed the train driver for going through a red light.
On 6 March 1989, at Glasgow, two people were killed and 40 injured when two suburban trains collided.
BR suggested human error in handling signal warning systems, and the number of train drivers passing red lights had doubled to 800 a year since 1979.
Again the picture seems to be slack maintenance, 60-hour working weeks, overcrowded trains (BR's response to this is to increase fares to cut passenger traffic) and cutting corners  to meet financial targets.
Laurie Harris, of the National Union of Railwaymen has said:
The pendulum has swung away from safety to economics.
Safety standards are being dictated by accountants.
A report by John Brown, Engineering and Constructors, leaked by Time Out Magazine (28.8.89) suggested 126 fire risks at Tottenham Court Road tube station.
At 19 of the locations, flames could not be put out easily, if at all, because of poor access to hoses.
Rush hour crowding was a serious hazard, and the station was 39 per cent understaffed.
An internal document found faults on BR's 47 million new resignalling project between Liverpool Street and Colchester (Guardian 29.8.89).
A picture emerges of declining Government support of a previously nationalised industry under privatisation which has led to intense pressure to reduce overheads and manpower with steadily deteriorating safety standards.
Accidents also occurred on the water.
On 6 March 1987, the ironically named P & o ferry Herald of Free Enterprise capsized with the loss of 188 lives, as a result of leaving the bow doors open.
It appeared that in order to cut time and costs it had become customary to close the doors after the ferries were sailing.
In this case the bosun responsible was asleep.
The Sheen inquiry found that the ferry company was ‘infected with sloppiness from top to bottom’.
The master, chief officer and assistant boatswain were directly responsible for ‘errors of omission’ which led to the disaster.
Underlying cardinal faults were the management who failed to consider safety on the vessels and did not listen to masters' complaints.
The Zeebrugge tragedy led to the prosecution of individual members of the crew of the vessel, and the board of the company concerned for unlawful killing, although they were eventually acquitted on the direction of the trial judge.
The National Union of Seamen declared a strike after the tragedy, one of the major concerns being over health and safety practice and legislation at sea.
On 20 August 1989, the pleasure craft Marchioness was struck in the early hours of the morning on the Thames by the 2,000 ton dredger Bowbelle with the loss of 57 passengers and crew.
The adequacy of the safety regulations, which allowed lighter craft to use the same bridge arches as heavy vessels was criticised, and immediate changes in regulations were brought.
The inquiry is still under consideration.
Mrs Thatcher saw this as the tragic side of a prosperous Britain, pointing out on the BBC news on 20 August 1989 when visiting the wreck, that people had more money nowadays, and seemed to be going out and enjoying themselves, which was why so many people were on board.
Seven coastguard stations have been closed since 1979, leaving 21 stations to cover 6,000 miles of coast.
The demand on these has increased, with  11,132 people being aided in 1988, as opposed to 8,867 in 1987 (26 per cent).
Michael Portillo, then Transport Minister, admitted in December 1989 that coastguards made up less than 1 per cent of his departmental budget, but 49 per cent of all overtime.
There are no regulations which limit the hours ships' crews work, unlike land transport workers.
Derek Bond (Guardian 22.8.89), assistant general secretary of the sea officers union UMAST, pointed out that adequate rest periods for crews is a mere recommendation which cannot be enforced.
The only way to compete with Third World and eastern bloc ships seems to be to cut back on crew rest hours and leave.
Since the Spirit of Free Enterprise disaster, the conditions on the ferries has got worse.
(Guardian 22.8.89)
Mandatory safety checks have been increased, without an increase in resources.
The Department of Transport regulates shipping safety, but UMAST and the NUS would prefer the Health and Safety Executive to do this.
Jack Kinahan, spokesman for the NUS said:
All these regulations are seen as impediments and burdens on the industry.
That generates an attitude of formal control, instead of the day by day probing and checking that should be  practised .
The concern over the difficulty of finding out how many passengers were on board the Thames pleasure craft was a repeat of the problem which occurred when the Zeebrugge ferry overturned.
After that for ferries, but not other classes of vessel, boarding passes were introduced.
That these were not just accidents which inevitably happen in modern travel and industry, was pointed out by the director general of the British Safety Council, James Tye:
Many of the accidents were foreseen, there had been warnings about fires in Tubes, how quickly ferries sank, and the hazards at football grounds.
Nothing was done until after these disasters.
Safety depends on good procedures, good management and sufficient inspectors to carry it out.
It is no use putting these accidents down to acts of God.
Why does God always pick on badly managed places with sloppy practices?
(Guardian 22.8.89)
However, the change in safety regulations and the harder line taken is not sufficient compensation for the curtailing and running down of health and safety inspections, nor the differences in health and safety regulations which exist between companies operating on land, and those, such as contractors on off-shore oil rigs who are at sea.
HEALTH AND SAFETY IN INDUSTRY
The catalogue of disasters affecting travel and sports industries has been mirrored by a steady rise in the accident rate in work places.
The general standard of work place health and safety regulation has declined, partially because there are insufficient inspectors to maintain regular safety checks.
In a report to the London Hazards Centre, Michael Meacher, then Shadow Employment Secretary, was quoted as saying of the Conservatives:
This government has cut factory inspectors by nearly 20% while at the same time increasing DHSS fraud inspectors by 160%.
(Hazards 88)
A mere 792 factory inspectors exist to protect 16 million workers in 400,000 work places and agriculture has had its inspectors reduced from 190 in 1979 to 156 in 1988 (Guardian 16.11.88).
Whilst accidents are increasing, health and safety inspectors have been cut by 20 per cent.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE), is currently receiving more Government support in order to attempt to prevent the increase in accidents, although the time between factory visits can be up to 5 years.
A leaked report (Guardian 27.4.90) concluded that the factory inspectorate was understaffed, with a 16 per cent shortage in the numbers of inspectors, low in morale and almost 4 years behind in its work.
The Government, however, is considering removing trade-union officials from the commission controlling the HSE before 1992, when the single European market becomes operable.
Construction is a notorious trouble concerning safety.
The HSE (Labour Research 1988b) analysed the deaths of 739 people killed in the construction industry between 1981–85.
There was an average of two deaths a week, of which 517 could have been prevented.
In 70 per cent of the cases positive action by management could have saved lives, and over 10 years the basic causes of death have not changed.
Experienced workers are just as likely to be killed as trainees.
The Channel Tunnel project led to the deaths of nine workers between mid-1988 and August 1990.
Seven of these were on the British side, where the contractors were fined 50,000 in March 1990 after the fifth death.
The injury rate on the tunnel site is 4.7 per cent of the workforce compared to a construction industry average of 1.8 per cent.
Men working on the site complained of pressure to cut corners to save time on the delayed project.
A safety audit in 1990 by Health and Safety Executive Inspectors pointed to:
an underlying weakness in safety management, particularly in leadership and administration, giving rise to an inadequate safety culture.
(Reported in the Guardian 13.7.90)
Between 1980 and 1985, 28 young people died and over 1,000 were seriously injured whilst working on Manpower Services Commission (MSC) programmes (Labour Research 1986).
The post-war period of improvement in the annual death toll at work has, in recent years, come to an end.
In 1985 there was a distinct rise in children killed whilst working.
The Low Pay Unit found that the annual death and fatal accident averages rose from 59 per 100,000 in 1985 to 142 per 100,000 by March 1989.
There were in addition 2,735 minor accidents involving Youth Training Scheme (YTS) participants in 1988–89.
Despite Government counter-claims that this increase is due to 1986 changes in definitions of accidents from minor to major and fatal categories, all the increases cannot be accounted for by the redefinition.
Ministers claim that accident rates on YTS are better than for the rest of the working population in that age group.
However, what actually has happened is that accidents for the 16–19-age-working groups have increased, so the comparison is hardly reassuring (Guardian 19.8.89).
The 1989 Employment Act now removes laws protecting 18-year-olds from long hours and shift work, so that there is more likelihood of industrial accidents.
Firms employing less than 100 people have higher death and injury rates than bigger ones.
During 1987 blitzes by the HSE of over 1,000 prohibition notices, which can only be served where there is a risk of ‘serious personal injury’ were issued, but led to only 25 prosecutions.
The issues of health and safety have been taken up by trade unions in the P & o ferries dispute, and the transport strikes of 1989.
A contributory factor in the Kings Cross Underground disaster was the lack of staff training staff in fire-hazard emergencies, and the low standard of cleaning due to cutbacks.
An earlier report by the Chief HMI of Factories commented that the sad record of death and injury in the quarrying industry showed no sign of reducing (July 1987).
Labour Research (1988a) suggested that the strict mining safety laws would have to be weakened if the coal industry were to be privatised.
Interestingly, after September 1987 factory and mines inspectors were forbidden to speak to the press on pain of disciplinary action.
However, John Howard, an official of their union commented as early as November 1985 that the HMI of Mines feared that the proposed new mining legislation would reduce the power of the HMI whilst raising the power of the colliery manager, who could decide what is ‘reasonably practicable’(Labour Research 1988a).
The reduction in the mining workforce (over half since 1979), has led to extra pressures on those miners remaining.
Mining and quarrying are still the most dangerous industries to work in, and in 1985 mining deaths and major industries were over five times the rate for other industries, including construction.
New technology has increased dust and noise levels, and  current dust levels suggest that one in 20 miners may develop lung damage after a lifetime's exposure, and four-fifths according to a British Coal survey in 1983 were exposed to damaging levels of noise.
Further risks are the increase in diesel fumes, back injuries, dermatitis and stress-related problems — all increasing in coal mines.
One spin-off of the miners' strike has been management's disappointment (see House of Commons Energy Committee, January 1988; comments by Sir Robert Haslam, Chairman of British Coal) with pit deputies responsible for health and safety, who are members of NACODS.
Haslam had hoped to recruit them to management, but was surprised and disappointed in their industrial action, and in March 1988, British Coal trained 100 members of the United Democratic Mineworkers to do NACOD jobs, alarmed by the militancy of NACOD.
This was in line with the Government's legislation aimed at preventing militancy in trade unions.
It should also be pointed out that white-collar industries have suffered from privatisation.
Up to 1980 the sick leave for industrial accidents declined considerably at British Telecom (BT), but from 1981 as a run-up to privatisation, BT introduced more competition into its working methods.
The accident rate rose notably from that time (Labour Research, 1987b)— a rate not helped by BT's cut in its safety officers which started in 1985.
On 6 July there was an explosion of the North Sea Piper Alpha oil rig which claimed 167 lives.
The inquiry was told fire fighting equipment was ‘virtually useless’ for 4 months before the disaster.
Several safety audits had been carried out after an earlier explosion in 1984, but Occidental, the owners, never released the findings.
A lack of life jackets and portable fire extinguisher in the emergency muster area, and the role of the rig's support ship during the rescue operation were criticised.
One problem is that offshore oil and gas industries have a number of bodies making regulations, but the principal inspectorate is the Department of Energy, which also has an interest in maximising production.
As with the shipping industry, this is seen as a conflict of interest.
In 1988 eight inspectors were responsible for the safety of 123 installations in the North Sea, including annual inspections, investigations of accidents and criminal prosecutions.
The unofficial strike of oil-rig workers in 1990 had as one of its major aims an improvement in safety.
A key demand was the transfer of responsibility from the Department of Energy to the Health and Safety Executive.
The general reduction in health and safety standards and inspection comes from Government cutbacks, and commercial pressure in an economy which favours profit maximisation and privatisation.
Judith Church, Health and Safety Officer of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union summed up the government's attitude to health and safety as:
We have a get rich quick philosophy where everything is geared to maximum profits.
If companies had to say how many died and were injured in their service each year, it might give the life and death of workers a higher priority.
POLLUTION
It is not just workers in industry whose health and lives are put at risk by criminal acts.
The pharmaceutical industry has a record of putting the consumer at risk of which the Thalidomide and Opren cases are the most famous.
The general public are also in danger from industrial pollution.
For example, in August 1989 there was concern over the amount of dangerous industrial waste brought to Britain for disposal from other countries.
As a result of exposure by Greenpeace, vessels were refused entry by harbourmasters and port managers.
The Labour Party environmental spokesperson argued (Evening Standard 9.8.89) that 800,000 tons of industrial waste were annually brought to Britain to be disposed of.
The same month saw growing concern over the water industry, subsequently privatised, because of the dangerously high level of nitrates and other chemicals being found in the water in some areas.
Britain has, however, constantly obstructed European Commission proposals to reduce atmospheric and water pollution, involving acid rain, control of emissions from large combustion plants, dumping of sewage sludge, disposal of titanium dioxide, and the entry of fertilisers into the water supply, according to Stanley Clinton Davis, EC Commissioner for the Environment (Labour Party News , April 1989).
According to the House of Commons Environment Committee our waste control regulations are a ‘shambles’, and nothing has been done about nitrates and excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers as requested by the EC.
Of the 426 chemicals cleared for use in farming, 166 are known to cause, or are suspected of links with cancer, birth defects, genetic mutations and allergies.
Forty-three per cent of fruit and vegetables in the UK have detectable pesticide residues.
Exemptions have been sought for EC standards concerning drinking and bathing water, whilst privatisation is implemented.
Britain disposes of toxic waste at sea-something forbidden in most other EC countries.
The reason for the reluctance to act on these issues, is of course, that they would be expensive and consequently affect the competitiveness of British capital.
MINIMUM-WAGE POLICY VIOLATIONS
The Wages Act of 1986 (WA) received the Royal Assent together with the  Social Security Act in July 1986.
Under the WA, young workers under 21 were removed from Wages Council protection.
Young people in service industries, garment industries, catering and shops, no longer have legal minimum rights covering wages and holidays.
Adults lose special rates for specific jobs, shift pay, holiday pay and unsocial hours pay.
There is one basic hourly rate with a limited number of hours and a single overtime rate.
Employees will no longer be able to opt out of cashless pay systems.
Wages inspectors (who police Britain's minimum-wage system), have been cut by 40 per cent.
Wages inspectors cover nearly half a million firms, mostly small and non-unionised, with a workforce of some two and a half million.
The inspectorate in 1990 could only visit, according to the Low Pay Review, some 7 per cent of firms, which averages out at a visit every 14 years.
One-third of inspections are a telephone call or a questionnaire, and the 1988 underpayment statistics suggested that 34.6 per cent of firms were underpaying their staff, and of the 9,000 firms involved only two were prosecuted.
The Government argued that as the Wages Act removes rights to paid holidays, additional rates for weekend and shift work, as well as 550,000 young people losing their rights to minimum wages, these cuts are justified.
This leaves each ‘outdoor’ inspector overseeing the wages of 31,000 workers in over 5,000 firms each year, as well as an additional 2,000 enquiries.
In the North of England, nearly half of firms visited were found to be illegally underpaying workers.
We can now see that the law and order issue cannot be divorced from the rest of the Conservative Government's policies during the Thatcher years.
In the field of welfare law, for example, the 1988 Social Security Act (SSA) upholds labour discipline, whilst developing the tradition of lesser eligibility.
The 1980 Social Security Act had made the abdication of one's duty to support one's dependants a criminal offence.
It altered the position of sponsored relatives for black people.
Sponsors could now be liable to criminal charges if their sponsored relatives had ‘recourse to public funds’.
Welfare benefits paid to strikers' families, who are, of course, not on strike but certainly impoverished, were to be docked 12 on the assumption they were in receipt of strike pay.
The 1988 SSA keeps benefits low and subsidises low wages.
If a claimant leaves his or her job ‘voluntarily’ benefit is withheld for up to 6 months.
The YTS scheme has forced young people into low-paid, and often dangerous work schemes, without significantly improving their employment possibilities after the 2-year term.
If they refuse to join one of the schemes, they lose their benefits.
Long-term unemployed claimants who work for ‘Benefit Plus’ receive benefits plus a top-up award for involvement on a job creation scheme, similar to the American Workfare projects.
CONCLUSION
This, then, is the other side to the Conservative notions of law and order.
Encouragement has been given to individualism, free enterprise and the pursuit of profit.
The struggle for intellectual domination has been supported by the use of think tanks such as the Institute of Economic Affairs, the Centre for Policy Studies and the Adam Smith Institute.
These have given an appearance of academic and scientific credibility to radical Conservative policies.
They have become involved in the hegemonic struggle by setting the agenda for political debate.
Formally independent of the Government, they have been able to raise contentious issues under the guise of kite-flying exercises without compromising individual politicians.
Intellectually central in moving privatisation into the centre-stage of policy making, and in the introduction of market economies in health and welfare they have added credibility to the enterprise culture.
The dismantling of the welfare infrastructure and the encouragement of the pursuit of profit has at times taken on the mantle of a moral endeavour.
While corporate crime might not be officially approved, the climate in 1991 certainly has encouraged the bending of rules and a cavalier attitude to the law amongst entrepreneurs.
The ideology of the enterprise culture through society has penetrated to a considerable degree to the young who grew up under Thatcher —‘Thatcher's children’.
A 1989 MORI Poll conducted by the BBC and The Independent newspaper argued that the ideology of Thatcherism was reaching its target of the young.
Fifteen to 28 year olds were significantly keener than their elders on private enterprise, sceptical about trade unions and a substantial minority hoped to own their own business.
Privatisation was particularly valued by the young, whether it be prisons, motorways, transport or care of the elderly.
Young males in particular were keener on high pay and promotion than older people, and less concerned with security or job satisfaction.
They preferred to negotiate their own pay and conditions, rather than leave this to trade unions.
Young working-class as much as middle-class respondents wanted home ownership, private pensions, meals out and foreign holidays.
Fish and chips, council housing, State pensions and holidays at home were out for all the young.
One-quarter of the sample wanted more ideologically luxurious goods, such as exotic fruit, stocks and shares, private education for their children, expensive cars and second homes.
Their only fears were nuclear war and  AIDS .
Given the ideological success of the enterprise culture, it is hardly surprising that the Thatcherite package has been bought, although, interestingly, more by young men than young women.
Of young women 66 per cent thought Britain was heading in the wrong direction, and that major changes were needed, and only 28 per cent felt things were all right the way they were.
This is the cultural background  against which fraud has been carried out.
The ideological success of Thatcherism is that it has been adopted by many young people for the values which direct their life style.
The Government, in order to attack the notion of the Welfare State, has held it responsible for encouraging dependency, idleness and the break-up of families.
The culture of dependency has to be replaced by the enterprise culture.
The work of Murray (1984) who attacked welfare scroungers in the United States has influenced the policies of the British Government.
There has been an attack on organised trade-union resistance, on marginalised groups, on young people, especially young black people in the name of a pragmatic economic programme.
Liberty has been sacrificed for convenience, the appeal to the rising crime rate as an ideological weapon against progressive teachers and liberal social workers has strengthened the Government's hand.
The only area in which this strategy is likely to come unstuck is health, where even radical supporters of Thatcherite policies have recognised that the sick cannot be held responsible for their illness.
Private insurance schemes clearly do not wish to become involved with either the mentally ill or the chronically sick.
They cannot be written off like other marginalised groups.
The enterprise culture has, however, led to an individualism which has encouraged fraud, materialism and contempt for collective support and social responsibility.
In this chapter we have tried to give some idea of the impact of the Conservatives' economic and social policies upon those crimes which do not fit into their own view of criminality.
By stressing superiority of the competitive as opposed to the collaborative, the individual as against the collective, the private as compared to the public and by elevating profitability to at times the sole criterion of success, they have created an economic framework where the survival of the fittest has in many cases come to mean the survival of those who are best at avoiding controls on their activities without being caught.
Workers, clients and the general public have all been victims in this laissez faire environment.
By allowing, in the interests of economic profitability, the financial institutions to regulate themselves, by weakening, in order to keep down industry's costs, the power of the agencies who are meant to control health and safety and pollution, the Conservatives again have revealed the ideological basis to their law and order position.
Inside the crisis and the crisis inside
Prisons, punishment and Conservative criminology
On 1 April 1990 prisoners took over the Strangeways Prison, Manchester in what was to become the most prolonged protest against inhuman and degrading conditions in penal institutions.
It was to be 24 days before the last hard-core  protesters gave themselves up.
The protest sparked off disturbances in 20 other prison establishments and spotlighted yet again the overcrowding in British Prisons.
The immediate response of the Government was to set up a committee of inquiry under Lord Justice Woolf to examine the events and the underlying causes.
One can only assume the Government had not read the steady stream of reports from both the Chief Inspector of Prisons and various prison boards of visitors during the 1980s.
The 1990 disturbances were only the latest in a series of eruptions — in 1986,1988 and 1989, which led to injuries and damage to prison buildings and equipment.
The Woolf inquiry was the fourth such in 5 years.
We may anticipate its conclusions on the basis of its predecessors.
Prisons are overcrowded with two or three inmates to a cell designed for one not uncommon.
Most prisoners are confined to their cells for long periods of time.
Sanitation is totally inadequate with the dehumanising practice of ‘slopping out’ still widespread.
Prison visits are too short and the facilities available for them are inadequate.
The general picture is of a barbaric degrading system in which the only real surprise is that violence does not break out more often.
In this chapter we will attempt to examine some of the reasons for the continued use of custodial sentences.
But we shall see as well that the Conservative belief, for both retributive and deterrent purposes, in punishment by incarceration, has at least had to acknowledge economic realities.
The vast expense of the prison system has led to the development of various non-custodial alternatives.
Punishment in the community has become the other side of Conservative penal policy.
The problem is to persuade both their supporters, and the judiciary and magistracy, that it is not an easy alternative, that the guilty will still suffer, the Government is not becoming soft on crime.
PRISON OVERCROWDING
To comprehend the scale of the problem facing British prisons some statistics are necessary.
In 1989 the average prison population for England and Wales stood at 48,600, a drop of some 3 per cent(1,350) over 1988.
This was the first fall since 1973 and was due predominantly to reductions in the numbers of remand prisoners, due to the success of the probation service's bail information schemes, and sentenced young offenders, partly due to the stricter criteria for custodial sentences for young people required by the 1988 Criminal Justice Act, and partly to the drawing up and implementation of ‘action plans’ for community plans by the probation service.
For adult offenders the picture showed little change from previous years and indeed the number of sentenced adult male prisoners had increased.
‘Certified normal accommodation’(CNA), the official figures for the number of prisoners which the system can officially cater for without overcrowding, allowed for 45,268 prisoners.
This was an increase of 2,700 over 1987 but little change (+18) from the previous year.
While a welcome improvement it still meant a gap of 3,332 between CNA and average population.
Worst hit were local prisons whose population on 30 June 1988, for example, exceeded CNA by 54 per cent (NACRO Briefing 1989c).
The Government had to deal with this as a matter of urgency, but had to maintain its hard line on law and order.
In July 1988, the Home Secretary announced an increase in the remission period, from one-third to one-half for prisoners serving short sentences.
This reduced the prison population by over 3,000, and without it the figure would have been 53,000.
The 1990 Home Office projections forecast that the average daily prison population would rise to between 61,700 and 62,600 by 1998 (Home Office 1990c).
This was slightly less than earlier forecasts to which the Government had responded by announcing a major prison-building programme.
Even with these forecasts, the programme is the largest undertaken this century.
It provides for the construction of 24 new prisons and, with extensions to existing prisons, for the provision of over 21,000 extra prison places by 1995.
In 1990 the average capital cost per place in those prisons under construction, or where work was shortly due to start was 117,000.
One reason for the increase in the prison population during the 1980s was the rise in the number of remand prisoners awaiting trial or sentence.
The average waiting time for trial at Crown Court was 56 days in 1989, and in that year remand prisoners made up just over one-fifth of the average prison population.
Incarceration has increased as a form of punishment.
In 1988 the courts imprisoned 20 per cent of adult men convicted, and 7 per cent of adult women, compared with 16 per cent of men and 3 per cent of women in 1976 (Criminal Statistics 1988).
We will discuss the trends in sentencing practice  in more detail below.
Less than one-fifth of offenders imprisoned during 1988 had committed an offence involving sexual or physical violence (Prison Statistics 1988).
Reconviction figures for prisoners released in 1985 suggest that 55 per cent of men and 34 per cent of women are reconvicted within 2 years.
Given that the average cost of a keeping a person in prison is 288 per week (a staggering 14,976 per annum), the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of imprisonment is questionable.
We need only to compare this to the average annual cost in 1986–87 of probation orders (900), community service orders (520), attendance sentence orders (117) or even places in probation hostels (7, 174) to see why the Treasury is in danger of becoming a radical advocate of decarceration!
(Probation Statistics 1987, quoted in NACRO Briefing 1989b.)
Expenditure on the prison service has also risen considerably.
Between 1978–79 and 1989 the budget for the penal system has risen 36 per cent in real terms (156 per cent in cash terms), with overtime pay for prison officers rising 137 per cent between 1979 and 1985.
Staff in the prison service has been increased, but the conditions of service, and the overcrowding have led to militant action by prison officers.
As Fitzgerald and Sim (1982) suggested, one reason for the instability of the prison system in the 1970s and 1980s was the militancy of the rank-and-file prison officers in conflict with their own union, the Home Office, prison governors and the prisoners themselves.
Since 1985, there has been action in several prisons over several demands, but perennially the amount of overtime that has to be worked.
In May 1985, Leon Brittan, then Home Secretary, was booed despite his figures saying that prison officer ranks had increased since 1979 by one-fifth, and that the budget for the Prison Service had risen 85 per cent.
The poor conditions within prison led to several conflicts between prisoners and prison officers.
This occurred at a time when the militancy of rank-and-file officers increased.
In 1985, officers took action at Bedford, Parkhurst, and Wormwood Scrubs.
Several incidents of violence became public.
In April and June 1985, 316 prisoners and 135 prisoners respectively, were injured (Guardian , August 10 1985), and in June a demonstration occurred at Holloway by 43 women protesting about brutality inflicted upon a fellow prisoner.
In April 1985, at Gartree — a long-term maximum security prison — there was a sit-in by prisoners, and in June of that year another at Parkhurst, Isle of Wight.
In September the staff at Albany, another maximum security prison, voted to keep prisoners in their cells, after a confrontation between staff and prisoners.
Prisoners were also involved in legal initiatives involving their civil rights.
They challenged the Home Secretary's 1983 policies which effectively abolished parole for certain categories of prisoners, but did win the right, with the assistance of the European Commission for Human Rights to be legally represented at prison disciplinary hearings.
A number of support groups were involved: Radical Alternatives to Prison; National Prisoners' Movement (PROP); Women in Prison; Inquest and the Prison Reform Trust.
The isolation of prisoners and their rights became less severe.
The problems which had arisen for the Government were the rising prison population, and the cost of imprisonment.
The solution suggested by the State to overcrowding in prison has been to expand the prison building programme (a suggested 16 new prisons), whilst simultaneously exploring non-custodial alternatives.
As early as 1973, community service orders had been introduced so that offenders could work in the community for up to 240 hours.
However, this has been used mainly for those whose crimes would not have sent them to prison anyway.
Alternatives to custody are more likely to pull into the system, new populations rather than reduce incarcerated ones.
We shall explore this further in the next chapter.
Prison security has become an issue, especially since the troubles in Northern Ireland, and it is worth noting that the 1983 report of the Chief Inspector of Prisons suggested that the lessons of the 38-prisoner-escape from the Maze could be applied to England and Wales.
Internal security has been strengthened by the use of MUFTI (Minimum Use of Force Tactical Intervention Squad) and the increased training of prison officers in riot control.
Segregation and control units have been used for difficult prisoners, especially in  women's prisons.
New prisons are likely to be made up of self-contained units holding 50–100 prisoners, with cells opening into a central area for staff observation.
Obviously, the prison building programme is based on the fear that violent crime particularly, is out of control.
Murders of policemen, child murders, and terrorism are seen as escalating, but of course these are far from the common run of prisoners — 95 per cent of crimes are relatively trivial offences against property.
Box and Hale (1982) located the prison building programme in a wider political context.
They saw the growth of unemployment, related as it was to a deepening economic crisis, as being accompanied by growing state coercion.
This was reflected in the rate and length of imprisonment:
This increased use of imprisonment is not a direct response to any rise in crime, but is an ideologically motivated response to the perceived threat of crime posed by the swelling population of economically marginalised persons.
(Box and Hale 1982, p.22)
They also indicate that for every 1,000 increase in youth unemployment, 23 additional males are incarcerated, even when the effects of crime rates and court workload are controlled for.
Sentencing policies, as a result of law and  order campaigns mean the prisoners are younger and more likely to be black.
These campaigns are not concerned to control serious crime.
Rather they are more concerned to instil discipline, directly and indirectly on those people who are no longer controlled by the soft discipline machine at work, and who might become growingly resentful that they are being made to pay the price of the economic recession.
(Box 1987, p.119)
As Box argues:
Not only have the total numbers and percentage of the population increased, but within this group the economically disadvantaged figure prominently.
(Box 1987, p.12)
As Box reminds us, and as we discussed in Chapter Five, the arrest rate is higher for young blacks (Stevens and Willis 1979) and these cannot be accounted for entirely by differences in criminal activity.
Black British youth tend to be charged for offences ‘easy to prove’, and appear before ‘tough minded’ magistrates (Cain and Sadigh 1982).
As Box puts it:
These disparities are bound to percolate through and produce a blacker prison population.
(Box 1987, p. 15)
Prisoners are male, and disproportionately young — a quarter of the prison population being under 21, whereas 15–20-year-olds make up only 10 per cent of the British population.
Prisoners have also become younger in their age profile.
By 1984 under-21s were 28 per cent of the prison population.
The prison system in England and Wales, then, is creaking and close to collapse.
During 1988 in a desperate attempt to ameliorate the problem in the short term, the Government opened unused Army camps as temporary prisons.
After the destruction of Strangeways prison and the dispute with the POA over conditions this option was again on the agenda in 1990.
Successive Governments, of both left and right, have failed to make any impact upon the excessive use of imprisonment as a means of punishment by the judiciary.
To understand the reasons for this we need to look at penal policy in a wider economic and social framework.
THE POLITICAL ECONOMY, PUNISHMENT AND IMPRISONMENT
Box and Hale (1982, 1985, 1986) and Hale (1989ab) have examined the relationship between unemployment and imprisonment since the end of the  Second World War.
The general conclusion of these analyses was that unemployment and imprisonment were related, in the sense that, after controlling statistically for the level of crime and numbers convicted, an increase in the level of unemployment led, on average, to an increase in the numbers incarcerated.
This needs to be seen in the context of recent trends in punishment in England and Wales, and in particular the proportionate use of imprisonment, probation and fines.
For statistical reasons, they used data from England and Wales only, leaving the separate judicial systems of Northern Ireland and Scotland, while acknowledging the experimental use of control techniques in Northern Ireland, and the softening up of public opinion prior to their introduction to the mainland.
Hale (1989b) argues that the long-term trend of a decrease in the proportionate use of imprisonment and a corresponding increase in the use of fines has been reversed.
Since 1974, and particularly since 1979, the use of imprisonment has been increasing relatively as well as absolutely.
There may be similar trends in imprisonment in other advanced capitalist societies which face similar economic and social problems to Britain.
However, as Downes (1982) shows, this is not inevitable.
Between 1950 and 1975 both Britain and Holland had similar increases in crime levels, but whilst the prison population in England and Wales doubled, in the Netherlands it more than halved.
Hence societies with similar modes of production can respond differently to imprisonment.
Rusche and Kirchheimer (1939) consider the relationship of changes in punishment and modes of production.
They argue that every system of production tends to discover and use punishments corresponding to its productive relationships — a classical Marxist approach.
When labour surpluses became a general phenomenon, and with declining profitability, there was fiscal pressure in the nineteenth century to reduce the size of the prison population.
In the relatively short period of time prior to the Industrial Revolution the function of the prison can be seen as related directly to the needs of the economy, in that labour was forced to work on specific projects to overcome labour shortages.
The prison served as a means of ensuring a supply of labour.
Since then there has been less of a general shortage of labour, but rather a shortfall in skilled, rather than unskilled labour.
Since the late nineteenth century, the problem has been one of a surplus of labour.
Quinney (1977) and Jankovic (1977) have argued that prison acts as a way of reducing the size of the reserve army of labour.
This is a rather simplistic argument.
It assumes that it is actually the unemployed who are being imprisoned, and, furthermore, is clearly untenable when faced with data which show the numbers unemployed in England and Wales many times greater than the numbers imprisoned.
This deterministic approach suffers by seeing the prison as existing to remove people from circulation, rather than its ideological function of social control.
Crises, of which high levels of unemployment are one manifestation, involve the totality of capitalist social relations.
The solution to these crises is a complex economic, political and ideological process.
As Braithwaite puts it:
during a period of economic crisis the hegemony of capitalist ideology fosters a search for alternatives to the failure of the system as an explanation for the crisis.
An explanation which makes eminent sense to everyone is to blame the victims of the crisis for the crisis.
(Braithwaite 1981)
While rejecting the mechanistic connection of Quinney and Jankovic, one can argue that in times of economic crisis, typified by rising levels of unemployment, imprisonment does serve an important social control function as a constant reminder to those not in work of the consequences of stepping out of line.
This approach, however, is open to charges of functionalism and presumes a conspiracy between judiciary and government.
Evidence for an association between unemployment and imprisonment has, however, been presented in, various studies from different countries (Braithwaite 1980; Inverarity and Grattet 1987; Inverarity and McCarthy 1988; Montgomery 1985; Laffargue and Godefroy 1987) and has been most strongly supported by time series data analysed using some variant of least squares regression.
The advantage of this method is that it is a multivariate technique which allows an analysis of the relationship between unemployment and imprisonment to be examined after controlling for other factors such as crime levels, numbers of convictions, and age structure of the population, which might affect the rate of incarceration.
The results of Box and Hale show that for post-war England and Wales, unemployment and imprisonment were positively related even after allowing for variations in other factors.
However, the disadvantage is that the use of regression analysis seduces its users into a causality which may not always be appropriate.
It would not follow that the recent decline in unemployment rates in England and Wales would lead to reductions in the numbers imprisoned after taking crime rates into account.
Unemployment is one indicator of underlying economic problems, and how a state chooses to deal with a crisis will have important implications for its social policies in general, and of course this includes policies on imprisonment.
Overall, however, the work done by Box and Hale for England and Wales suggests that after controlling for other relevant variables, rising levels of unemployment have been associated with the increased use of imprisonment.
The relationship  between unemployment and imprisonment has persisted throughout the post-war period, intensifying since 1974 (Hale 1989b).
TRENDS IN THE USE OF PUNISHMENT IN ENGLAND AND WALES
In September 1986, the prison population of the United Kingdom was, in absolute numbers, the highest of the member states of the Council of Europe — 53,971 or 95.3 per 100,000 of the population.
Only Austria with 102.5 per 100,000 and Turkey with 102.3 had higher proportions of their populations in prison.
By 1988, the United Kingdom had risen to top position in both absolute and relative terms.
In September of that year 55,457 people or 97.4 per 100,000 of the population were imprisoned.
This compares with relative figures of 95.6 for Turkey, 84.9 for West Germany, 75.8 for Spain, 44.0 for Greece and 40.0 for the Netherlands (NACRO Briefing 1990a, Council of Europe 1989).
A similar picture emerges when prison admissions are considered, with the United Kingdom in 1987 imprisoning 347.9 people per 100,000, the highest for any major member state of the Council.
The average size of the sentenced prison population has been increasing steadily since the Second World War.
In 1948 it was 19,765 and by 1988, 38,500 — of which 1,286 were female.
Crime rates have risen even more dramatically over the same period: from 522,684 indictable crimes recorded by the police in 1948, to 1,407,774 in 1968, and by 1988 to 3,715,800.
It does not follow that increases in crime accompanied by increased numbers of convictions necessarily entails more people being incarcerated.
If we wish to discuss changes in punishment it is perhaps more helpful to look at the percentage of those found guilty receiving different types of sentence.
Until 1974 in England and Wales the probability of receiving a custodial sentence upon conviction had been declining steadily.
Bottoms (1983) examines data from 1938, 1959 and 1980 and shows that for all adult indictable offenders the percentage of custodial sentences drops from 33.3 in 1938 to 29.1 in 1959 to 14.8 in 1980.
The penalty which had the greatest proportional increase over this period was the fine, roughly doubling in its proportionate use from 27 per cent to 53 per cent while probation also declined from 15 per cent of all sentences to 7 per cent(Bottoms 1983; see Table 7.1).
Since Bottoms wrote his essay however, this trend has gone into reverse, as he himself reports in a later work (Bottoms 1987), and as can be seen from the figures given in Table 7.1 (updated from Bottoms (1987) using Criminal Statistics (1988)).
The downward trend in the proportionate use of imprisonment which had begun in the early 1950s halted in the mid-1970s, In fact the turning point can be located quite clearly in 1974.
In that year the proportion of convicted adult males given a custodial sentence had reached a low of 15 per cent.
Subsequently this figure began to increase steadily and by 1988, the latest year for which figures are available, it was 20 per cent.
(The corresponding figures for adult females were 2 per cent and 7 per cent and again 1974 marked the low point in the proportionate use of imprisonment.)
Over the same period there was an accompanying shift away from the use of fines.
By 1974 they were used in 56 per cent of guilty cases for adult males but subsequently their proportionate use declined and by 1988 the figure was 42 per cent.
In other words between 1974 and 1988 there had been a 25 per cent reduction in the proportionate use of fines and a corresponding 25 per cent increase in the proportionate use of imprisonment.
What is also clear from Table 7.1 is that these changes were most pronounced after 1979.
Since 1974 not only have the absolute numbers being sent to prison increased but the courts have become more punitive in the sense that they are sending a higher proportion of those convicted to prison.
Since their election victory in 1979 the Tories have followed a two-pronged penal policy.
While exhorting the judiciary to use custodial sentences only for the really wicked, who commit serious offences, they have refused to compromise the supposed independence of the judiciary by interfering directly in the judicial process.
Instead, they have on the one hand embarked upon the biggest programme of prison building this century, whilst on the other searching for alternative punishments to prison.
In the 1989 statement on Government expenditure they announced that the Home Office was to receive yet another increase in money to enable it to build two extra prisons, to set up 30 day centres for parole on probation, to recruit 300 more police officers in provincial forces, to employ an additional 1,300 civilians in the police forces and to make the Immigration and Nationality Department more efficient.
The day centres are clearly part of a campaign to make probation a ‘tougher’ option for the courts.
The two new prisons were in addition to the eight new ones opened since 1985 and another 18 at various stages of completion.
They will bring the total of new places available by 1991 to 10,000 and the programme will provide 20,000 new places in all by the mid-1990s.
Prior to the announcement of the additional two it had been estimated that the total capital cost of the 26 new prisons would be 870 million at an average cost per place of 69,200.
The Government has also increased the manpower in the prison service.
Between 1982 and 1987 the average annual numbers of prison officers have increased by around 12 per cent per annum.
The long-term trend has been to reduce the number of inmates per officer.
Forty years ago there were about six inmates for each officer.
In 1986–87 there were approximately two and a half inmates to one officer.
The principle of least eligibility, not withstanding the massive prison building programme, seems to operating with some vengeance.
We noted earlier that in 1989 the certified normal occupation (CNA) of the prison system had reached 45,286.
The average prison population of 48,600 thus represented an average overcrowding of 8 per cent.
The situation is particularly acute in remand centres and local prisons.
There are 28 local prisons in England and Wales housing over one-third of the prison population.
They are used to hold the least dangerous categories of prisoner, including those waiting to be tried or sentenced (remand prisoners), fine defaulters, those serving short sentences and prisoners awaiting reallocation to training prisons.
Table 7.2 shows the extent of overcrowding in the ten worst local prisons in March 1990.
The average overcrowding in male local prisons in  1989 was 29 per cent.
Many of the prisoners are locked up in their cells for most of the 24 hours in the day.
The problem of remand prisoners, is particularly acute.
On 28 February 199010,228 prisoners were awaiting trial or sentence in penal establishments.
This constituted 22 per cent of the total prison population.
In addition, more remand prisoners were held in police or court cells.
If 1988 is any guideline only 60 per cent of these remand prisoners will eventually receive custodial sentences.
Perhaps the simplest way to conclude this section is to quote the words of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons who wrote in his annual report for 1986:
The physical conditions in which many prisoners had to live continued, therefore, in many cases, to border on the intolerable.
For remand prisoners in particular, whose numbers increased sharply during the year, conditions were particularly poor.
Overcrowding, coupled with the lack of in-cell sanitation and the sharing of limited and inadequate facilities on landings, represented much human misery.
Many inmates in the local prisons spent almost all day locked up, two or three men to a cell intended for one, with no integral sanitation and little to do.
IDEOLOGY, IMPRISONMENT AND RECESSION
Melossi (1985) discusses how social discourses change with the various stages of what he calls the political business cycle.
In the upswing this discourse is characterized by energy and hectic frenzy.
As he notes they are ‘not a time for punishment’.
Melossi discusses the ‘roaring twenties’ and notes that ‘an attitude of leniency, indulgence and experimentation with newer methods and reforms permeated the whole society’.
His description could well apply to the 1960s in the UK, with the proviso perhaps that social  changes lagged behind the business cycle somewhat.
The sixties, however, certainly marked the end of the era of post-war austerity and a time when the belief that the State could solve most economic problems was strong.
It was a period when the newly (re) found sense of idealism and hope led to great expectations of the rehabilitative force of prison and its alternatives.
Hudson (1984,1987) has catalogued how the reforming penal language of the 1960s became replaced with that of justice and punishment during the 1970s.
Here we will consider the reasons for this change in language and consider how Melossi ‘s ‘vocabulary of motives’ helps us to understand changes in England and Wales since 1974.
For Melossi it's the discourses which count:
For this reason in the downswing of the cycle, the sources for an increase in severity of punishment should not be sought either in specific ‘economic’ functions, such as the control of an increasing mass of the unemployed, or in specific motives of individual agents of social control, such as the common belief that unemployment causes crime.
Although such motives can be found in individuals, they, like the punishment rate itself, are associated with the general ‘moral climate’ that develops in hard times.
(Melossi 1985, p. 183)
Melossi contends that earlier attempts by Box and Hale to use an argument based upon the ‘unintended consequences of purposive social action’ are limited.
In this section we will consider review this argument and develop it using the work of Box (1987).
We believe that the argument is strengthened by linking it to Melossi's ‘discursive chain of discourse’ and by showing how this discourse changed in the 1970s.
The climate which developed in this period in Britain was one in which the prejudices of the judiciary were reinforced by a media campaign supportive of the Tory Party's ideas on moral decay and over-dependence upon the state.
It is no coincidence that 1974, the year in England and Wales which saw the end of the decline the proportionate use of imprisonment, and the beginning of a major economic crisis during which the numbers of male unemployed more than doubled by 1976 and increased by a factor of 5 by 1984, also marked the beginning of the end of the welfarist consensus.
As we discussed on p.5 the Labour Party responded to the economic crisis with a programme of public expenditure cuts.
At the same time it launched an ideological offensive launched to justify this approach to solving the crisis.
This offensive had other faces and one of the major targets of the media was the power of the unions which had been used to protect, more or less successfully, the interests of the workers and to maintain the Welfare State.
The celebrations surrounding the 25th anniversary of the accession of the  Queen were used as means of playing down class differences and uniting the country around slogans like ‘coats off for Britain’.
At the same time a campaign against welfare scroungers was launched to make unemployment financially and socially undesirable.
Law and order became increasingly to be used as symbol for the moral and economic decay of the country and this was reinforced by the use of the latent racism of the working class in the publicity given to muggers which was presented at least implicitly as a black crime (see Hall et al .
1978).
The popular press was also to play the racist card in attacks on the social security system with lurid reports of Asian families staying in luxury hotels on welfare payments.
Perhaps most crucial, however, was the transformation of trade unionists from harmless cart-horses into mindless, vicious thugs.
The problem for the Labour Party, of course, was that playing this propaganda card was always likely to backfire since its natural constituency should have been the very groups it was attacking.
The Tory Party meanwhile had no such problems.
As we saw in Chapter Three it was able to give voice to the fears of many concerning the supposed breakdown in moral standards, they equated economic decline with moral weakness and established hegemonic control by focusing on the breakdown of law and order.
The Tory Party had a clear mission which was to break the power of the unions, and the way that it did this was by using the law.
It successfully portrayed itself as having the solution to Britain's economic problems which it saw as being due to excessive State intervention in every sphere, and to the  dependence mentality which this produced.
It committed itself, as we have seen, to a radical restructuring of the British economy at the expense of the working class, and integral to this programme was an attack upon trade-union ‘power’ and the dismantling of the welfare-state.
Union power had to be broken, and this was achieved by linking it with the breakdown in law and order.
By implication, the Labour Party was seen as supporting unions, and thus having no respect for the rule of law.
The period prior to the 1979 election was one of acute crisis-Callaghan's ‘winter of discontent’, economic chaos, and a general feeling of malaise.
The Conservatives successfully mounted a campaign which linked welfare scroungers, individualism, anti-collectivism, breaking the dependency culture and replacing it with the enterprise culture, trade unionists as criminals, moral decline, the need for personal responsibility and personal discipline.
The collectivist welfarist society was presented as being a central part of the moral decline.
The social security scrounger, seriously curtailed in the restructuring of income support systems in 1988, joined industrial pickets, single-parent families, youths and gays in the Tory gallery of folk devils.
Taylor (1987) argued that the Tories were aided in this by:
organisations of people carrying out crucial authority functions, within the English bourgeois state, in particular local magistrates, local police chiefs, police federation representatives and senior traditional schoolmasters.
(Taylor 1987, p.312)
In the early years of the 1970s each of these groups was involved through their professional organisations in a campaign against what they saw as the damaging consequences of the 1960s liberalism.
The Magistrates Association mounted a successful campaign against the 1969 Children and Young Persons Act which sought to replace courtroom hearings for young people with ‘welfare dispositions’.
The National Association of Schoolmasters (NAS) concentrated upon attacking the comprehensive school system and importantly, was involved in public campaigns around the level of violence in schools (Taylor op. cit.).
The violent, dangerous and delinquent youth of the magistrates and NAS were also present in the statements of individual Chief Constables and representatives of the Police Federation who articulated publicly their own theories on the causes of crime in a manner which would have been thought unthinkable a few years previously.
We have discussed this in more detail in Chapter Three where we saw how the parameters of this debate as set out in these campaigns were seized upon by the Tory Party with little or no response from the Labour Party who seemed unable to cope with the authoritarian drift.
‘Law and order’, ‘respect for the law’, ‘moral degeneracy’, ‘the burgeoning crime levels’ became the catch phrases of the moment.
What was needed, of course, was a return to discipline both at work and in society.
Since industrial anarchy was nothing other than the other side of the coin of the rapidly rising crime levels, both would be defeated by tough measures which would restore to the citizen a feeling of security and freedom.
Furthermore, the Welfare State had encouraged moral decline and negated individual responsibility for individual actions.
The growing army of unemployed was the consequence of years of trade-union power and restrictive practices and the first step in the restructuring of the economy would be to criminalise many of the traditional weapons used by the working class to defend their interests.
The most disturbing threat to our freedom and security is the growing disrespect for the rule of law.
In government as in opposition Labour have undermined it.
(Conservative Party Manifesto 1979)
The number of crimes in England and Wales is nearly half as much again as it was in 1973.
The next Conservative Government will spend more on fighting crime even while we economise elsewhere.
(Conservative Party Manifesto 1979)
The Conservatives won the 1979 election at least in part on a law and order programme.
An Independent Television News Research survey reported on election night after the closure of the polls indicated that 23 per cent of voters who switched allegiance did so on law and order and that 22 per cent were concerned with the role of trade unions.
As Clarke and Taylor (1980) and Clarke et al .
(1982) show, the coverage of the Law and Order issue by the media was dominated by the agenda set out by the Tory Party aided by the magistracy, the NAS and certain sections of the police.
We find, then, in the discourses of crucial sectors of the bourgeoisie in this period precisely that change in the general moral climate described by Melossi:
in periods of economic decline, a ‘discursive chain' of punitiveness and severity spreads across society.
(Melossi 1985, p. 183)
Central to their economic strategy was a commitment to reduce public expenditure (except for the law and order budget) and the breaking of the power of the trade unions.
The two were of course linked.
Strong trade unions, especially in the public sector, had successfully resisted attacks on the Welfare State in the past, and so needed to be defeated if the Tories’ solution to what they saw as the major problem — inflation — were to be successful.
At the same time the huge increases in unemployment, which were the corollary of the expenditure cuts and non-interventionist market-oriented economic policy, undermined the resistance and the strength of the unions.
It was within this ideological framework which was always present but as outlined above became to be more and more publicly articulated by the Tories prior to 1979 that the operations of the justice system in England and Wales need to be considered.
The Courts have responded to perceived growing crime rates during this period by increasing the use of prison sentences and reducing the use of non-supervisory sentences such as fines or unconditional discharges.
The outcome has been the imposition of more sentences at the higher end of the punishment tariff over and above the changes in the volume of crime.
As Box and Hale (1982,1985,1986) have argued, this response is not merely a mechanical response due to the increased workload but is due to a sufficiently large proportion of judges and magistrates responding to deteriorating economic conditions by resorting more frequently to the use of imprisonment.
This is made easier by the shift  in the ideological climate discussed earlier, since to be too soft on those convicted would be to prolong the permissive trend which had led to the high crime levels and the chronic economic problems.
The judiciary and magistrates are of course drawn predominantly from the middle and upper classes (see Box 1987, p. 134–135) and as such can be expected to reflect the beliefs and prejudices of their class.
Their natural constituency is ‘conservative’ and especially the preservation of private property.
Consequently, rises in the level of unemployment are likely to be a source of deep anxiety to them since they believe that the unemployed are weak and amoral and therefore more likely to be criminal.
Add to this their desire to protect private property and to end the moral decline which has crippled the country and a potent brew is produced.
As Box argues, when this is combined with:
the ‘knowledge’ that ‘crime is getting worse’and that ‘fear of crime’is becoming a major social problem — messages that politicians, via the media, communicate — then the judiciary are bound to become more sensitised to the dangers that lurk in high levels of unemployment.
(Box 1987: 135)
And so they are bound to respond in a more punitive manner.
Hence we do not need to argue that the judiciary are in any sense part of a gigantic conspiracy; they merely act according to their beliefs which inevitably reflect their class interests.
Furthermore, as Box succinctly puts it:
given the ‘Constitutional Independence’(but political reliability) of the judiciary, there will be no concerted effort to prevent or curtail the steady drift towards more frequent use of severe penal sanctions whenever many judges and magistrates react to their perceptions of growing or potential disruption resulting from the upsurge in the volume of unemployment and an intensification of class conflict in general.
(ibid, pp.135–136)
TOO MUCH LAW AND ORDER?
THE PROBLEM — OVERCROWDED PRISONS: THE SOLUTION — PUNISHMENT IN THE COMMUNITY?
The proponents of a Conservative approach to criminology in the United Kingdom are faced with the contradictions inherent in the Manifesto pledges of the 1979 Election.
They have to deal with not only a still increasing level of crime, but also, because of a judiciary which shares their belief in the efficacy of toughness and hence is over-enthusiastic in the use of custodial sentences, the consequent overcrowding and appalling conditions of prisons.
As we noted earlier the Conservative Government has followed two major policies in an attempt to deal with this penal crisis: firstly, simply to build more prisons; and secondly, to reduce the numbers receiving custodial sentences.
Integral to the second policy is the need to extend custody into the community.
In this concluding section we will examine this strategy in more detail.
Successive governments have stressed that imprisonment should be used only as a last resort yet, as we have seen, its use increased during the 1980s.
The recent history of Government attempts to reduce the prison population is a history of ‘tinkering’.
Each Home Secretary has in turn drawn back from taking the most obvious and practical steps with the excuse that they cannot legislate for the judiciary — its independence is inviolable:
It is not for the Home Secretary, government or the House to lay down to the courts how many people they send to prison.
It is our job to provide places for them.
(Douglas Hurd,Hansard , 5 November 1987, Column 1055)
The judiciary can be encouraged, exhorted, informed, reasoned with, but it can never be instructed.
The result has been that major reforms are completely avoided and every minor reform is weakened or sabotaged.
The principle of judicial independence i– so prized by judges that Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice, has refused even to meet Home Secretaries to discuss sentencing policies.
The nearest the Government came to bringing the judges and magistrates ‘within the disciplines of efficiency and cost effectiveness’(Guardian 1.10.90), was to circulate to all courts details of the full costs of their sentencing decisions.
The Magistrates Association's immediate response was that its members already had this information and would continue to pass the sentence they considered appropriate to the offence.
For a more extensive discussion of earlier failures to reduce the prison population see Box and Hale (1986).
In the late 1980s the Government began yet another attempt to reduce prison overcrowding.
In line with its notions of community crime prevention it saw the way forward to be shifting the emphasis from custodial institutions to punishment in the community.
To do this it had to gain the support, both of the judiciary and the public, for its new measures.
It began an attempt to do this in several policy documents.
The 1988 Green Paper (Home Office 1988b) announced its concern over the numbers of offenders sentenced to custody.
It stated that the Government's intention was to increase court and public confidence in the effectiveness of community-based penalties.
It argued that these were not soft options but properly applied would be tough penalties which aided the battle to reduce crime.
The paper emphasised the diversion of offenders from custody, noting the success of intermediate treatment programmes and the increased use of cautions for juveniles.
A  major theme was that of reparation; offenders would recompense the community, and where possible, the individual victim for their crimes.
More use was to be made of day centres and community service.
The guilty offender's freedom was still to be curtailed but outside of institutions.
Drug and alcohol abuse were raised as issues which, because of their connection with crime, needed to be part of a programme for offenders.
To pacify the law and order lobby, a distinct difference was recognised, between property offences (95 per cent of all crime), viewed as amenable to punishment in the community, and crimes of violence which need to be punished more severely in order to protect the public.
The role of the probation service became clear when the Home Office published, in 1988c,Tackling Offending — An Action Plan ', a document setting out how these proposals could be put into practice.
It suggested that probation services took the lead in drawing up local initiatives for young adult offenders at risk of custodial sentences.
The probation service was seen as central to organising punishment in the community.
Tracking, curfews, electronic monitoring and weekend restrictions were suggested for use with new supervision and restriction orders.
In the early stages after sentencing, supervision would be strict, and because of this would have an effect upon the probation officers' traditional, caring function, emphasising instead a more custodial role.
One problem recognised in the paper is the question of whether the magistracy and judiciary would be prepared to substitute this form of sentence for those previously receiving a custodial sentence.
What has tended to happen historically, with earlier attempts to provide alternatives to custody, is that instead of moving offenders currently receiving a sentence of imprisonment down-tariff, in this case to some form of punishment in the community, down-tariff offenders — those who formerly were dealt with by a fine or conditional discharge — have been given the new sentence.
The sentencers have used the new powers, not to reduce the numbers being sent to prison, but as a way of substituting a tougher penalty for petty offenders.
The original motivation for the new measures — to reduce the prison intake — thus has been thwarted.
The implication of shifting the role of the probation officer from the rehabilitative ideal of ‘befriending the prisoner’ to being more centrally involved in punishment, surveillance and control means that:
the new order would contain additional elements of control which some members of the probation service might perceive as inimical to their approach to working with offenders.
(Home Office 1988b, p. 17) but should this happen, the probation service could:
contract with other services, and private and voluntary organisations to obtain some of the components of punishment in the community.
(ibid)
The probation service would supervise the order, ‘but would not itself be responsible for providing all the elements’.
The role of a multi-agency, market-oriented provision emerges.
The implied threat to anon-co-operating probation service is that a new organisation could be created:
to take responsibility for the arrangements for punishment in the community and providing services through contracts with other organisations.
(ibid, p. 18)
Overcrowding in custody is to be prevented by extending control to community custody, using a mixture of existing and contracted services.
The main disadvantages emphasised are not humanistic or rehabilitative objections, but financial ones.
A new service would have to be funded by the Exchequer, not local government using existing services.
In response, the probation service agreed to set up Intensive Probation Programmes, and in April 1989 national standards were announced for community service orders:
Their purpose is to ensure that community service orders are tough and demanding; that they are managed consistently and with discipline and thus that the public and sentencers can have confidence in them.
(Home Office, 1990b).
The 1989 Audit Commission report on the probation service noted considerable variations in hours of attendance required at day centres, in breach of procedures for failure to attend the centres, in the frequency of visits offenders received whilst on probation and in unit costs.
These would have to be standardised, but with some local flexibility according to the offence.
In 1990, David Waddington, the then Home Secretary, presented proposals which included reducing standard sentence remission from two-thirds to half the initial sentence.
This ‘hard line strategy’ reveals yet again the contradictions inherent in the Conservatives' law and order policy.
The move argued against the notion of reducing custodial sentences, clearly signalling to the judiciary a more cavalier attitude to the problems of prison overcrowding.
These recommendations are part of the 1990 Government White Paper (Home Office 1990a), which claimed to set out a coherent, legislative framework for sentencing, matching punishment to the seriousness of the crime, and making the distinction between violent and non-violent crime.
A hard line was to be maintained for violent and sexual offences with provisions for longer sentences, and Crown Courts were to be given the powers to  impose heavier sentences than the individual offence justified, to persistent offenders deemed to be a public risk.
A sharp distinction was made between these crimes and property crimes which could be subject to a community focused punishment, involving a mixture of community service, probation, and curfews.
A major theme of the paper was that punishment should fit the crime not the criminal, that vandals, thieves, and burglars should not be jailed for persistent offending.
The White Paper placed great emphasis on probation reports, to which attention would have to be paid before a custodial sentence is recommended.
Increased use of financial penalties were also advocated.
In addition to the changes in remission it was proposed to allow parole to be removed for prisoners serving over 4 years if it was felt that their release would put the public at risk.
A post-imprisonment supervision was to be introduced for those serving more than one year, and wider powers given to the courts to make parents take responsibility for their children's offences.
The White Paper recognised that since 1981 the number of juveniles under 17 given custodial sentences, had fallen by more than 50 per cent, and there is no evidence that the reduction in custodial sentences has increased juvenile crime (174,000 known juvenile offenders was reduced to 119,000 in 1988).
Females under 18 years of age were recommended as particularly suitable for non-custodial sentences, and attention was drawn to the strengthening of supervision orders for juveniles in the Children's Act of 1989.
A new youth court was proposed to deal with the 14–16-year-old group-the largest group of juvenile offenders — whilst under-14-year-olds were to be dealt with increasingly by non-court procedures.
The White Paper put forward punishment in the community as an attempt to reduce custodial sentencing and to save on expenditure.
The probation service and voluntary agencies were to be funded to provide an alternative form of punishment for the less serious offender.
In line with the Green Paper which preceded it, it advocated an increased use of curfew orders, day centres, community service, bail hostels, electronic monitoring, financial penalties, and combinations of financial penalties, and community punishment.
The success of the Criminal Justice Bill stemming from the White Paper ultimately depends on the judiciary and the magistracy changing their sentencing strategies.
This can happen, as local initiatives with magistrates have shown but the prognosis for major change on a national level is, judging from the history of earlier attempts, gloomy.
This will require the Court of Appeal to extend its work on guideline sentences to more relatively minor crimes.
This is a gamble, and there are indications that the Court of Appeal may refuse, seeing this as political interference with the judiciary.
There were already signs of the difficulties ahead in May 1990 when it was reported that  in order to avert a row with judges and magistrates the Home Secretary was contemplating watering down the principle that punishment should fit the crime not the criminal.
Given that:
Judges, magistrates and justices' clerks believe they must keep custody as a deterrent against frequent offenders and ‘to give society a rest’.
(Guardian 25.6.90)
Mr Waddington was apparently considering allowing them to take into account the need to protect the public from even quite minor offences.
This attempted compromise will not help the Government in persuading the probation service to alter its traditional role and manage punishment in the community.
A major argument put forward by the Home Office was that the proposed tougher community punishments would be an alternative to custody for persistent petty offenders.
Harry Fletcher, the Assistant General Secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers (NAPO), commented that the move was:
fudging the principle, and the result will be a flawed strategy which will increase the prison population.
(Guardian 25.6.90) since he now feared, that as with previous alternatives to custody, the new measures would be used instead for people who would previously have avoided jail.
Financially, the programme depends on savings gained from reducing the prison population.
Consequently, if the judiciary fail to reduce their proclivities or custodial sentences, and hence the savings fail to materialise, the alternative system will be under great strain.
At the same time as the White Paper the Government published a Green Paper (Home Office 1990b) on the reorganization of the probation service.
This argued it was necessary to create a ‘new model probation officer’ with less emphasis on social work, but with the right balance between care and control.
Probation should in no sense be seen as a soft option by the judiciary.
The Green Paper considered in detail how the working practices of probation officers would have to change, reminding the probation service that it is a criminal justice agency, in obvious anticipation opposition from NAPO.
The paper emphasised the need to protect the public from serious offenders punished in the community, and noted that crime prevention initiatives with offenders: ‘involves firm and constructive work’.
These moves will also mean that the probation service has to stop seeing itself as the exclusive provider of services and facilities: it is suggested that other voluntary or private sectors may make better provision.
Assessment, rather like the Griffiths report for community care and health is to become as to plan and manage suitable programmes for  offenders.
Planning, social inquiry reports and enforcing court orders are to be the future task of probation, with an emphasis on the new task of the management and organisation of time, resources and workloads.
Funding is to be centralised and Home Office policy on contracting out is to be followed.
Some local areas will be amalgamated to improve their economics and management.
The Green Paper makes clear the future direction of probation, through comments on the training of probation officers.
It takes note of the Coleman Report (1989), which recommends removing Home Office sponsorship from sub-standard courses.
Davies (1989) sees these as being those courses which pay insufficient attention to practical probation issues, such as resource management, penology, criminology, criminal law, principles of sentencing and other issues.
The emphasis is clearly on the probation officer as part of the criminal justice system with a managerial role in supervising punishment.
Implicit in the Green Paper is the notion that generic social work principles are not paramount, and that probation courses will be brought to heel over their curriculum and orientation.
The training of probation officers could continue and be included in the Certificate of Qualification in Social Work and the Diploma in Social Work courses, but if these do not measure up to required standards, they will be replaced with anew training syllabus put out to tender in the educational market place.
A new more punitive role is envisaged for the probation service, which is threatened by being replaced by a new executive service.
Faced with the financial consequences of its commitment to a hard law and order policy the Government has attempted a conjuring trick.
It has proposed a community-based programme of punishment but in order to sell this to both the judiciary and its supporters it has constructed around it a rhetoric of toughness.
Question marks are already being raised over its proposed new measures.
NAPO believes that rather than reducing the jail population the prison numbers will rise.
It argues that the stricter probation conditions proposed will lead to more breaches of the orders, and at present a large proportion of those who breach go straight to prison.
The history of previous attempts to reduce the prison population by introducing alternative punishments suggest that NAPO is likely to be proved right.
Is Conservative criminology here to stay?
CONSERVATIVE CRIMINOLOGY, IDEOLOGY AND THE STATE
As we have seen, conservative criminology is distinctly linked to other conservative social policy.
The problem with New Right Conservatism is that it has to claim to be reducing the influence of the State in the field of welfare, health, income support and education, but has to maintain the strong State in the arena of law and order.
Mrs Thatcher saw State control as central to socialism:
Communism is the left foot of socialism, and Fascism is the right foot, using socialism in the sense that it is total regimentation and control by the state.
(The Times , 29.8.77)
A major part of the Conservative agenda has been to undermine socialism and develop a contemporary form of laissez-faire market economics, to move Britain from a culture of dependency to the enterprise culture.
This has had to be done in the context of a strong State — a State which will keep the streets safe, preserve the ‘British’ way of life, and protect property.
The belief has grown that somewhere in the urban jungles, there lurk the dangerous classes who will, if not closely surveyed and controlled, challenge the peace of the streets.
Without a strong State, this underclass will erupt into fragmented resistance, indicated in social disorder.
In a strange way, this is a truth believed in by both the left and right criminology, as well as in British society at large.
There is a classical thread running through sociology which wants to argue (see for example, Giddens 1973; Rex and Tomlinson 1979) for the existence of an underclass, composed of underemployed, unskilled people — a significant number of them black.
This lumpenproletariat has fared badly, hit by the increasing market competitiveness for jobs, housing, education and  hence, decent incomes and good health.
For Rex and Tomlinson, black people have become ‘a separate under-privileged class’(Rex and Tomlinson 1979, p. 275).
This group's inferior class position is linked to their families' origins as immigrants, and is compounded by poor incomes and racism.
We see that the origins of racism lie embedded within the relations of capital, and are reinforced by institutions which historically regulated the flow of black labour.
Hence immigration, and that attitudinal spin-off from immigration, the view that black people are all ‘immigrants’.
The sectional interests of the white working class and trade unions all indicate that divisive and sectional class interests are not just cultural phenomena.
Sivanandan (1982) engages in a dialogue with racist ideology, by seeing the relationship between racism and capitalism as essentially instrumental.
Racial struggle is linked to class struggle, and racism fractures both the political superstructure and economic base.
Field (1989), in his discussion of the underclass, leaves out the racial dimension and emphasises the economic aspects.
He produces evidence to show how the poor have fallen behind the better-off sections of the British class system.
The better off have, in many ways, forgotten the underclasses, yet they live indirectly off their misery.
This group or sub-class has been detached from the rest of the British population, and is composed of the longer-term unemployed, single parents and elderly pensioners.
It suffers from current economic policy, with the holding down and restructuring of welfare benefits in the context of rising inflation.
Whilst Field does not emphasise an ethnic dimension to this underclass, it is clear that public fears are focused not on the elderly, sick or female, but on the young, especially young men — and particularly young black men.
Most sociological writing on the underclass has suggested that it has a potential for what Giddens calls ‘hostile outbursts’— that is, riots or mass violence and public disorder.
This is a view shared by the general public, and by politicians.
Scruton (1984) has argued that freedom for conservatives is only possible when subordinated to an organisation or arrangement which defines the individual's aim.
The value of individual liberty is not absolute, but is subject to the authority of established government.
People need congenial government:
It is through an ideal of authority that the conservative experiences the political world.
(Scruton 1984, p.19)
This is why social consciousness in the form of patriotism, for example, is important to Scruton.
It also helps us understand the ethnocentric and ruling-class view of much conservative criminology.
Nationalism is not only acknowledged, but is a virtue.
Even the National Front are only an extension  of a marked allegiance to patriotism, authority and the Government.
Scruton offers us an articulate perspective on the attractions of conservatism for those who, fearing social change and the future, try to hold firmly onto the past.
For all its brave talk of radicalism, the New Right depends emotionally on the attractions of the familiar and the known, constructing a romantic view of a mythical past to bolster up its attack on collectivism.
Legal change becomes prioritised and justified through expediency; opposition becomes reduced — an irritation to the smooth flow of economic policy.
We begin to see why, as Scraton and Chadwick (1987) remind us, sexism, racism and class hatred are so deeply institutionalised in the British State.
They allow the marginalisation of identifiable groups, who are the product of a surplus population suffering the enforced unemployment necessary to stabilise the long recessions of capitalism.
As sections of the working class become sectionalised, so their reputations become criminalised.
Scraton and Chadwick correctly identify the politics of marginalisation as an integral part of the operation of criminal justice, just as Hall et al .
(1978) showed us it was part of policing the crisis.
The politics of marginalisation are essential in the smooth operating of a set of social and economic policies intended to reform radically a welfare state, maintain unemployment and to deal with the consequences that therefore manifest themselves in social problems such as public disorder, addictions, inner city riots and rebellious fractions of communities.
This means that a necessary emphasis has to be made on respectability, hard work, thrift and respect for law, so that marginalisation can become extended into criminalisation.
Sir Kenneth Newman, then Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police commented:
Throughout London there are locations where unemployed youth — often black youth — congregate; where the sale and purchase of drugs, the exchange of stolen property and illegal drinking and gaming is not uncommon.
The youths regard these locations as their territory.
Police are viewed as intruders, the symbol of authority — largely white authority in a society that is responsible for all their grievances about unemployment, prejudice and discrimination.
They equate closely with the criminal rookeries of Dickensian London.
(Newman, 1983 ‘Policing London: post Scarman’.
The 1983 Sir George Bean Memorial Lecture 24.10.83.)
Black youth, then, assumes symbolic importance by being equated with the inability of the police to maintain public order, a feature which encourages law breaking elsewhere and reinforces the phenomenon of urban decay.
We may bring some theoretical light on this by considering discussions of ideological formations in a culture of authoritarianism populism, called  ‘Thatcherism’.
For the Conservative Government to maintain any level of legitimation in ideological or cultural spheres, they have had to construct a definition of common sense which reinforces their definition of the social order.
The cultural and ideological influence of the Conservative government since 1979 has been considerable, articulated most clearly in the utterances of Mrs Thatcher.
Discursive themes such as nation, self-help, respectability, have been constructed and related to class subjectivity.
Hall (1988), in particular, has argued that the power of that brand of New-Right Conservatism known as Thatcherism consists largely of the skilful way in which it has disconnected a number of themes — self-help, anti-statism, public order, anti-trade unionism, nationalism, share ownership — from the basically bourgeois discourse in which they have been traditionally lodged.
They have then been re-articulated into a discourse of popular common sense and respectability.
Thatcherism's new discourse has had consequent effects on the construction of subjectivity and consciousness.
This common sense has affected not only Conservatism's traditional adherents, but has had an effect upon that Conservatism latent in working-class respectability.
To develop hegemonic gain the Conservative Party has constructed itself as the party which will bring prosperity, reconstruct traditional values, end dependency, encourage work and oppose the threats of progressiveness, ethnic groups and cultures, and ‘loony left’ policies in local government.
Hence law and order, the maintenance and control of the dangerous classes and the preservation of public order have been ideologically central to its construction of consensual support.
Where this fails, a legitimation crisis occurs.
On the level of ideology the Conservative Government has attempted to tackle not only a crisis of legitimation but also of motivation.
This has been done by an emphasis on individualism, self-help, hard work and thrift, whilst at the same time there has been an attack on collectivism and socialism as repressive and  unworldly values.
Gramsci (1978) has suggested:
The methodological criterion on which our own study must be based is the following; that the supremacy of a social group manifests itself in two ways, as ‘domination’ and as ‘intellectual and moral leadership’.
(Gramsci 1978, p.57)
He argues that in the historical process of conflict and compromises, one fundamental class emerges as dominant and directive, not only in the economic sphere, but also in the moral and intellectual spheres.
The State is the unifier and arbitrator of differing interests and conflicts.
Hegemony evolves in an extensive but temporary form, equilibrium is only relative.
When hegemony begins to come apart, the dominant class resorts to coercion, leading to a ‘crisis of authority’.
However, it is through popular beliefs that the mass of the people and the leading groups in society connect.
Ideas are material forces for Gramsci, and hence consciousness is not spontaneous but structured in certain ways, which correspond to the general structure of society.
For Gramsci:
Philosophy cannot be separated from the history of philosophy, nor can culture from the history of culture….
One's conception of the world is a response to certain specific problems posed by reality, which are quite specific and ‘original’ in their immediate relevance.
(Gramsci 1978, p.424)
Common sense is central for Gramsci, pervasive yet unsystematic.
It has a basis in popular experience, but unlike philosophy does not present a unified conception of the world:
Every social stratum has its own ‘common sense’ and its own ‘good sense’which are basically the most widespread conception of life and man….
‘Common sense’ is the folklore of philosophy, and is always halfway between folklore properly speaking and the philosophy, science and economics of the specialists.
(Gramsci 1978, p.326)
We can see then, that as conscious subjects, we may draw upon common sense as explanation, and that there is a struggle for the definition of this vis-a-vis the State.
The force of law is that it becomes part of common sense, and makes ‘common sense’ prescriptions about public order, theft and hard work.
The State then operates as an educational function, as Gramsci suggests, in this case, to educate us as to the worthy and the unworthy, the deserving and the undeserving.
For Gramsci, law reflects economic relations, and it is eternally and generally a weapon of class domination, a classical Marxist position.
However, the link with common sense is put well by his biographer, Fiori:
Gramsci's originality as a Marxist lay partly in his conception of the nature of bourgeois rule (and indeed of any previous established social order), in his argument that the system's real strength does not lie in the violence of the ruling class, or the coercive power of its state apparatus, but in the acceptance by the ruled of a ‘conception of the world’ which belongs to the rulers.
The philosophy of the ruling class passes through a whole tissue of complex vulgarizations to merge as a ‘common sense’ that is the philosophy of the masses, who accept the morality, customs, the institutionalised rules of behaviour of the society they live in.
(Fiori 1970, p.238) The law for Gramsci exists both in political society or the State, and civil society — private organisations outside the State.
The State exercises coercion, but civil society performs the function of maintaining hegemony, or domination by consent.
The legal apparatus operates coercively to maintain hegemony, particularly in periods of political and ideological crisis.
Law educates and adapts the mass of the people to the goals of civil society, defined through ruling class, notions of morality and custom.
The general function of law — that is the dynamic of the legal system or the ‘juridical problems’ as Gramsci called it — is to render the ruling group homogeneous:
creating a social conformism which is useful to the ruling groups' line of development.
(Gramsci 1971)
For Gramsci law unifies fractions of the ruling class, as well as concealing the reality of the social structures for the masses.
Ideological mystification obtained through legal devices has to be won so that political propaganda, political party speeches, definitions of marginalised and criminalised groups such as militant trade unionists and black youth, are vital in the construction of conformity and mystifying legal enactments.
Hegemony has to be won and is central to maintaining the status quo in legal enactment.
The State teaches us how to view the world:
In reality, the state must be conceived of as an ‘educator’, in as much as it tends precisely to create a new type of civilisation….
The law is the repressive and negative aspect of the entire, positive, civilising activity undertaken by the state.
The ‘prize given’ activities of individuals and groups must be also incorporated in the conception of the law.
(Gramsci 1971, p.247)
The practice of politicians and intellectuals is central to understanding law as a key apparatus maintaining hegemony.
Hunt (1976, pp.178–187) has developed some of these ideas in his consideration of law as an instrument of ideological domination, which legitimises and mystifies class rule.
The effectiveness of such a legal system depends upon its ability to express the rights, powers and interests of subordinate classes.
Sumner (1979), makes the point that law depends upon its ideological encapsulation of a consensus constructed outside itself, in other economic, political and cultural practices.
Any legal system has to have an ideological base which represents an ideological alliance between the ruling class and other classes and class fractions.
Progressive legislation is fought for and gained by organised resistance, often on a class base, though this may be concealed.
However, the problem with law is that it can be radically re-ordered through political  institutions.
Its relationship with justice varies considerably from State to State, depending on the degree of coercion necessary.
For Sumner, law embodies the appearance of reality produced by social relations, so that, for example , an employment contract appears as a consensual contract between equals (a point also made by Hunt), but it also embodies those appearances as they have been seen and interpreted by classes and groups who make laws.
An employment contract not only individualises what is essentially a class relation, but it individualises it in such a way that it expresses the dominance of the employers and their ideological grasp of the apparent relations between individuals.
The ideological grasp of the employees is subordinated and does not appear in the legal document which ensues.
Whilst the examples used come from civil law, we can see that the ideological grasp of those subject to criminal law is removed totally, because ‘common sense’ would not allow it a voice.
One could not maintain the criminal justice system otherwise.
That is not to say that miscarriage of justice, or reform of criminal law does not occur.
This can be expressed through disputes between high-bourgeois individuals, themselves acceptable to the legal system as with the Guildford Four, who, partly as a result of international pressure, had highly placed clerics and members of the judiciary supporting their release.
Alternatively, it can be the result of a public campaign, as with the repeal of the ‘sus’ law which was repealed because of public pressure, but allowed public order to be maintained through other laws.
Law can be seen as a public ideological front, which conceals the workings of a social formation, Sumner (1979) reminds us.
This reveals law as a politically constructed, ideologically formulated institution, which has an educative process.
Gramsci (1978) has pointed out that once a mode of production is established, with corresponding modes of political and cultural discourse, then law is developed to regulate that particular social formation.
Legalisation and legal process respond to social problems, and are not unilaterally constructed.
At different levels and in a very real sense, it is ‘the law of the land’.
The Conservative Government has won important victories in ideological consent.
It has had to rewrite aspects of law and order in order to gain support for its economic policies.
It has played on the fears of rising crime, unsafe streets, unemployed youth, in order to develop common-sense notions of criminal justice.
This has not occurred in a simplistic or deterministic manner, as can be seen from the retention of the abolition of the death penalty.
However, as a Party it has managed to project itself as the supporter of law and order, and simultaneously to construct the parties of opposition as the supporters of disorder, misrule and irresponsibility.
The differing strata of the working class have shifted in their forms of work, in the divisions created by long-term unemployment, by generational differences, and by ethnic  composition.
Because of this, culture and identification have also shifted in terms of the sites in which subjectivity is constructed.
Many forms of political resistance and consciousness, feminist, gay, ecological and pacifist, have developed outside of party politics, and have developed analyses and strategies which go beyond traditional class politics.
Class is only one site in which subjectivity is constructed.
Opposition to conservatism has relied too much on traditional class subjectivity, only recently reading its divisions and movement.
The strategies for the modernisation of the British economy has meant that strategies to undergo this, operate as modes of both economic and social regulation.
Hence, there is a necessary attempt, in order to bring in economic regulation, to construct a conservative recomposition of social and moral life.
This is why the themes current in Conservative criminology are so important.
This is not to deny the force of economistic elements in capitalism, but to indicate how certain ideological and moral themes assist in the maintenance of economic control.
Hence the extent to which Conservative criminology is here to stay depends on more than mere changes of political parties.
It is closely related to the regulation of a particular form of social formation and is intimately linked with political and economic forces, and the consequent social problems which emerge.
In order to gain any consensual alliance in the area of law and order a State has to take note of the emerging social formations, class fractions, cultures and consciousnesses of a multi-ethnic, gender-conscious society.
It has to respond to the emerging consciousness of the black community, gay people, feminists by marginalising them and delegitimating their claims.
By making such groups irrelevant, the State can write off the progressive movements of the last 20 years.
We have seen in this account the rise and legitimation of Conservative criminology for a government elected on a law and order issue.
What has become a matter of concern is that as society becomes more complex, and as the common coin of politics moves away from socialism — and indeed social democracy — it becomes important to preserve and develop those rights which have come to be considered fundamental.
Those rights which have been established, need to be defended, and therefore access to effective legal resource is indispensable.
Without this, the rule of law becomes supplanted by the law of power.
It is essential for the powerless and the poor to have access to as large a range of legal services and skills as those at the disposal of the authorities.
The Critical Lawyers Group has suggested the establishment of a Public Law Project which would provide assistance in matters relating to public law to people who have little or no access to such assistance, due to their social disadvantage or lack of income.
Britain has been considered to have fundamental, but uncodified rights.
These include fair and open government, ready access to justice, as well as expectations about a  home, an adequate income, a full education and employment.
However, as there is a shift away from the concept of the State as a provider, and more towards the private sector making provision on a market basis, there arises an alteration in the balance of social power.
The Public Law Project is seen by radical lawyers as essential in being able to offer a range of legal skills to the disadvantaged.
This pays particular attention to the body of law which has attempted to redress abuse of power by central and local government, and other organisations.
The Public Law Project would undertake specialist legal work in relation to public and administrative law, including legislation and public policy.
The aim would be to provide specialist research, advice and information, to agencies on the ‘front line’ and to provide legal services to the disadvantaged in public law issues.
In some ways this move is paralleled by the development of Charter 88, set up in November 1988 on the anniversary of the revolution of 1688.
It aims at bringing about a Bill of Rights, a fair electoral system, proper devolution and a written constitution that ensures government is subject to the rule of law.
This was a response to a widespread belief that the concept of an unwritten constitution could mean the erosion of civil liberties.
Scotland is governed like a province, Northern Ireland is a colony and the Government has eroded such traditional civil liberties, such as habeas corpus, peaceful assembly, the freedom of information and expression, trade-union membership, freedom of movement and freedom of local government.
An important ideological feature here is that the erosion of freedom in each of these areas is seen as an individual issue, systematically lessening the sum of these curtailments of freedom.
The issue central to the analysis of Charter 88 is that:
Being unwritten, the constitution also encourages a piecemeal approach to politics; an approach that gives little protection against a determined, authoritarian state.
The Charter considers that civil rights, because of their unformulated nature, are conditional upon the goodwill of the Government and the compassion of bureaucracy.
It calls for a new constitutional settlement which enshrines civil rights in a Bill of Rights, and places the executive under the power of a democratically renewed Parliament, and all State agencies under the rule of law.
It wants the independence of a reformed judiciary, and the provision of legal remedies for all abuse of power by the state and its officials.
Given the move towards a common European community with common citizenship and agreed rights, this is a well-selected moment to press for this radical reform.
This suggestion was, not surprisingly, refused by Mrs Thatcher, who, despite the fact that her Government used the guillotine in Parliament to  ensure a jury can no longer have a say in the public interest, as they had in the trial of Clive Ponting, declared in a written reply to Baroness Ewart Biggs, that:
The government consider that our present constitutional arrangements continue to serve us well and that the citizen of this country enjoys the greatest degree of liberty that is compatible with the rights of others and the vital interests of the State….
Some of the most oppressive states in the world have written constitutions.
However, whether Mrs Thatcher meant by ‘us’, the British, the Government, or whether she was using again the royal ‘we’, is not clear.
What is clear is that current constitutional arrangements do suit an authoritarian government well.
Such a state can manipulate ideologically and legally the vagaries and anomalies of an unwritten constitution.
The Charter has considerable social democratic support (as Ken Livingstone pointed out,Tribune , 13.1.89), but this is mainly directed at its hint of a Lib-Lab alliance.
The British constitution, by being unwritten, lacks fundamental protection for its citizens.
For example, it lacks a law such as the American Fifth Amendment, which protects a defendant being compelled to ‘be a witness against himself.
That means that the British Government could, as it did in September 1988, simply decree that the courts can take a negative view of any defendant who chooses not to co-operate with the police, or take the stand in his or her own defence, as in the changes in the right to silence rules.
There is no Sixth Amendment guaranteeing the right to ‘a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury’, which would have prevented the trials without jury which have existed in Northern Ireland since the 1970s.
When considering the right to silence it is salutary to examine the case of Clintom McCurbin who, in October 1988, died while being arrested in a Next clothes shop on a case of alleged credit card fraud.
McCurbin died of asphyxiation from pressure applied to the neck, but the police who arrested him said that they thought he was faking as he struggled for life.
The coroner's jury brought in death by misadventure, on advice by the coroner.
Detective Chief Superintendent Cole, the final witness at the inquest, said he was unable to interview the two arresting constables, as they had been advised by their solicitors not to answer questions.
In contrast, when, in the same month, three terrorists were charged with conspiracy to murder Tom King, former Secretary for Northern Ireland, armed not with weapons but with a magazine article on sniping, it was announced in mid-trial that significant changes were to be made to a suspect's right to silence.
All three were sentenced to 25 years, although Martina Shanahan had served 200 days virtually of solitary confinement at Risley whilst on remand and was said to be losing her mind by the time the trial began.
Subsequently, the three were to be released on the grounds that the statements of King and others had prejudiced their case.
Interestingly,The Times reported at the time that not enough professional people served on juries, and that manual workers and the unemployed did not ‘represent a cross section of society’ made up by juries.
Letters followed from various retired judges and lawyers agreeing that juries performed better when they were ‘middle aged, middle class and male’.
Whilst the Charter can be regarded with suspicion because of its association with political pacts, and therefore a drift to centrist politics, it does nevertheless raise important issues about legislative reform.
It could stop the erosion of rights catalogued throughout this book, and for this reason such a document needs to be considered seriously by the socialist opposition in Britain, and not written off as mere attempts at electoral reform when instead it should be developing a radical heart along democratic socialist lines.
What is illustrated by these attempts to introduce a written constitution an unlikely event in modem times — is that there is considerable concern over the ambiguities and lack of clear codification in an unwritten constitution.
A determined and authoritarian State can prepare ideologically the ground for repressive legislation by constructing certain forms of criminal personality and behaviour as necessarily outside of reason, and outside of ordinary law.
We have seen that this can be used to monitor communities seen as rebellious and ‘un-British’, be they black or Irish, non-familial groups such as gay communities, militant trade unionists, alleged terrorists, the poor, single parents and the unemployed.
Once defined as unrespectable or dangerous, they are subject to legal prosecution, often by semi-legal and dubious methods.
The danger is that this form of prosecution and monitoring becomes accepted by the parties of opposition as realistic.
The difficult thing is to defend those who are unpopular or and-social defendants.
This is to confuse their civil rights with their activities.
Once the feeling arises that a strict law and order has to be maintained defined by the Government, deviant and oppositional groups become no longer worthy of fair trial and due procedures of justice.
One theme which has occurred throughout this book, is that law and order, and indeed Conservative criminology, has developed in response to social anxieties felt by ‘respectable’ elements of British society about a Britain which has difficulties in coming to terms with its position in a changing world.
It is no longer possible to maintain a Little England attitude in the new European community.
Contemporary Britain is a multi-ethnic, multi-racial, culturally diverse society.
It is no longer dominated by established tradition, or established religious beliefs; it has new populations with new sets of consciousness.
In order to gain hegemonic support, the Conservative Government had to establish a  moral position which sought to comfort those sections of the British electorate concerned about the changing political and moral climate.
In its economic sphere, commercial interests needed to emphasise consumerism, which meant the developments of new leisure interests, life styles, and the liberalisation of sexuality.
Even a cursory examination of television advertising styles reveals young people, usually male, depicted in styles which are not the traditional collective uniforms of the youth cultures of the 1970s, but mixed to combine street style with street creditability.
The individualised young men and women in the advertisements are single, and hence available, but could be any class, even classless.
Their occupation is not clear (they might even be unemployed) but they are linked by consumerism and by success.
The young men struggle alone through dark urban streets, radiating glamour and style, the message is clear you are never alone with a flexible friend.
However, this necessarily locks out the unemployed, who are the dark side of this culture.
Against the changing world envisaged by the consumer oriented enterprise, there are the new poor, the new urban beggars.
Consequently, there is a nostalgia for traditional values, and it is to the socially threatened lower middle class, and to the respectable working class that the Conservative Party has made a moral appeal.
It has to counteract its won message of self-centred pursuit of affluence, the enterprising go-getting individual, so central to its enterprise culture, by positing the safe world of clear, responsible morality.
We have seen since the early 1980s appeals to the family, attacks on the ‘moaning Minnies’ and ‘whingers’who cannot make it, and counteractions to permissiveness.
Since recessive threats to the money markets occurred in the ‘big bangs’ of the 1980s, the enterprise culture has shown it can remove jobs as quickly as it creates them.
It is vulnerable to wider world economic forces, and stability is then to be found in respectable family life and firmly grounded morality.
Pressure groups have arisen against permissiveness, single-action campaigns against abortion, homosexuality and ‘loose’ sexuality.
Outrage has been expressed against crime, trade-union activities and public disorder, often linked with outrages concerning terrorism in popular rhetoric.
The moral terrain of the right has taken a strong line with football hooliganism, under-age drinking, heroin addiction, welfare scroungers, young criminals and the unemployed and homeless youth.
Even the school curriculum has been closely scrutinised in its national form.
English Christianity is preferred to multi-ethnic religion and British heroes of history, not the interpretation of political events, are emphasised.
We can see that the economic aims of Thatcherism have been contradictory to its moral postures.
What these moral stances have done successfully, is to define the Labour Party as progressive, which has become synonymous with irresponsibility and permissiveness.
This is particularly emphasised in  progressive municipal boroughs, whose opposition is written off as the insanity of the ‘loony left’, to the extent that the Labour Party itself seems nervous of suggesting anything socialist or progressive for fear of losing the middle ground.
Traditional political concerns such as class war, or class exploitation have become muted.
Obviously the ideological appeal to Thatcherism is across a broad spectrum of social locations.
Taylor (1987) has interestingly suggested that the key roles played by organisations in the law and order debate, were those with crucial authority functions within the British State.
These include magistrates, police chiefs, police federation representatives and senior traditional schoolteachers.
Noticeably absent from this list are senior members of social services departments.
Drawn from a more liberal tradition, they are seen as part of the permissive professions who encourage the delinquent and the feckless.
They are perceived as unlikely to take an authoritarian line, yet they have remained politically uncritical of Government policy, during the attacks on their departments made by the media during the child abuse, and transnational adoption controversies.
Never once have they suggested that cuts and understaffing have tragic consequences, a view put forward by their colleagues in the health professions.
The groups mentioned by Taylor, he suggests, were concerned with the falling legitimacy of moral authority in Britain.
It was to this group that the moral and cultural rhetoric of the right was addressed.
This rhetoric was offered to make sense of a changing society, which by the mid-1980s resulted from Conservative economic policy.
Its appeal was, however, beyond this group, but it offered the prioritisation of authority, patriotism and family values.
Obviously this contained its own contradictions; the patriotism of the football hooligan had to be tempered by the authority of the law.
The central theme of Conservative morality and order was that of public order.
The streets and public spaces had to be seen to be safe, from both criminals and demonstrates.
Traditional values had to be re-established, and it is this which may be the heritage of Conservative law and order.
While we have charted the moves away from the more strident outpourings of the 1979 campaign, within the Conservatives' law and order strategy over the last decade, it should not be assumed that they will not revert to this rhetoric if the need arises.
Lagging in the opinion-poll ratings in the early months of 1990 they seized upon the Anti-Poll Tax campaign as a means of once more attacking the Labour Party.
After the demonstration against the Poll Tax on 30 March 1990, the Home Secretary accused Labour MPs of exhorting people to break the law.
In the House of Commons he responded to Tony Benn's comment that ‘despair and a sense of social injustice have often lain at the roots of civil disturbance’, by suggesting that Mr Benn was  selective about which laws people ought to obey and went on to provide another explanation:
I think one can identify quite easily the cause of this violence: sheer wickedness.
(Guardian 4.4.90)
However, this attempt to once more equate opposition to their policies with criminality, and hence deflect attention from the real issues, was thwarted somewhat by the Strangeways riot the next day.
CONCLUSION
In this book we have tried to indicate the ways in which a law and order policy informed by a conservative criminology emerged before and since Mrs Thatcher came to power in Britain in 1979.
In order to pursue its economic policies, the Conservatives had to construct an ideological climate which justified its unpicking of the Welfare State.
This it did by demanding a return to the family and Victorian values.
Yet it replaced the philanthropic and rehabilitative ideas the Victorians had towards the ‘dangerous classes’ with the notion of evil individuals.
Conservative criminology is part of the ideological background of economic liberalism.
A moral climate has been created in which collective responsibility has become unfashionable.
Instead, we have the enterprise society where profit at any cost has become the holy grail.
Ironically, with its determined attempt to restructure the British economy at the expense of the working class, and by taking such a hard line on scroungers and loungers, the Conservative Government has created the very social conditions which have led to the intensification of the very crime wave it was elected to end.
To retain its hegemonic dominance it criminalised the inner city uprisings of disenchanted youth, marginalised the youth of the black communities and removed trade-union struggles from the field of civil law to the arena of public disorder.
When expedient justification for a more centralised and militaristic policing was required British citizens were presented with the spectre of Northern Ireland, the colony over the water, its ‘special case’ justifying its separate code of judicial practice.
Under Conservative rule civil liberty became seriously eroded.
Any support, whether financial or political for those outside the enterprise culture — the poor, the homeless, the unemployed — has been written off as the unrealistic and dangerous machinations of the ‘loony left’.
We have seen the ways in which a law and order policy, informed by a Conservative criminology, constructs oppositional subjects to the State against which it then acts.
The ideological and political levels are closely related to the economic.
Ultimately, the legal system in this form of social  structure defends the economic planning of the State.
Market forces remain free because of public imagery about the feckless, the idle and the deviant.
The great danger is that this will not be reconstructed when there is a change from an authoritarian State to one more committed to socialism or social democracy.
Having lost the ideological battle for being the party of law and order, will the next Labour Government want to show that it, too, can take a firm line over public order, fraud, social monitoring and industrial militancy.
The aims of the Conservative discourse, we have argued, have been to develop a law and order society.
This was the only area in which a strong State was encouraged.
Taking as its bench mark the fears and anxieties of the lower middle classes, discipline and thrift were encouraged, safe streets promised and firm action taken against militants, trade unionists, terrorists and other folk devils.
As we have seen, this approach became less dominant in the second half of the 1980s, although it is still there as a card to be played should political problems necessitate it.
We need look no further than the police handling of the Poll Tax demonstrators in March 1990 and the subsequent attempt by the then Home Secretary to turn this into an issue of law and order.
This occurred at a time when the Government support in the opinion polls was at one of its lowest ebbs and seemed a desperate attempt to create an atmosphere in which opposition to the Poll Tax became synonymous with criminality.
Nevertheless by the mid-1980s there was a move away from the idea that the strong State and its criminal justice institutions could stop crime to an emphasis on the need to involve the active citizen.
The iron hand of the Conservative administration's first 5 years gave way to sermons on personal responsibility.
This served two purposes.
Firstly, it allowed the Government a potential escape route from the escalating costs of its apparently futile tough tactics.
Secondly, it allowed them to make virtue out of a necessity by pushing law and order once more ideologically centre-stage as another area where the individual could do more than the State.
Crime prevention has becomes the responsibility of the private citizen.
This has taken either a commercial form, for example, the encouragement of better security for private housing, or a voluntary form, such as neighbourhood-watch schemes.
The basis of morality and law-abiding behaviour has become the family and it follows that parents must be made responsible for their children's  misdemeanours .
A major sub-theme is privatisation, seen in the plans to put electronic surveillance out to tender, and the running of certain penal institutions such as bail hostels by private firms.
After the Strangeways disturbances the problem of prison overcrowding became more immediate and the need to encourage more use of community-based punishments more urgent.
The tensions between toughness and value for money persisted, however, and against a background of large increases in the crime figures, David  Waddington faced, in October 1990, the annual ordeal for Home Secretaries of addressing the Conservative Party Conference.
He received a standing ovation for his comments on retribution from violent offenders, on his personal belief in the deterrent effect of capital punishment and for his promise that ‘life imprisonment in the worst cases will mean life’.
Changes in the parole system were promised so that serious offenders would serve a longer proportion of their time in jail.
He also announced in the same speech the Government's first considered response to Strangeways; they would introduce a new offence of prison mutiny with a maximum penalty of 10 years.
He commented on the riot:
It was a disgraceful affair and over the past few years there have been far too many riots in our prisons.
We have all had enough.
(The Times 11.10.90)
His speech was redolent with phrases designed to warm the hearts of the rank and file.
He pledged to ‘sweep the drunken louts off the streets’.
He announced that courts would be given powers to bind parents over for the good behaviour of their children so that they could be ‘brought face to face with their neglect’.
In line with the wide-spread Conservative emphasis on family virtues the central message of the speech was that the starting point of the fight against crime was the family.
The importance of punishment in the community was restated but in such a way that electronic tagging was seen as a tough option.
The Home Secretary was not about to be seen as going soft on the petty criminal.
No word was given, however, on how the Government's social policies had worsened the plight of the poorest families already suffering under the economic consequences of Conservative rule.
No discussion was initiated on how the climate of rampant economic individualism might have coloured the moral climate of society.
No considered view was offered on the underlying problems of prison conditions that had triggered the riots.
The speech underlined the fact that the self-proclaimed party of law and order, despite 11 years of holding the reins of power and massive investment in the criminal justice system had no long-term solutions to the problems.

7 MANAGERIALISM IN CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION
The inability of the Fulton initiative to produce radical changes was only one of a number of administrative reforms which by 1979 were generally adjudged to have failed.
PESC, PAR and the CPRS had not lived up to initial expectations, and changes in the departmental pattern had failed to produce either significant administrative gains or organizational stability.
Consequently the Thatcher government elected in 1979 turned away from what Pollitt (1984, p. 121) describes as ‘the classic [Machinery of Government]issues’— the macro-structure of departments and policy appraisal and planning mechanisms — towards one concentrating primarily on resource use and constraints.
In this way the logic of Whitehall reform effectively coincided with Thatcherism's emphasis on the use of business techniques within the public sector generally.
As observed in Chapter 1, the Thatcher government's general approach has been to couple the application within the public sector of those private managerial techniques perceived as most conducive to value for money — notably objective setting and performance measurement — with an increasing encouragement to greater consumer responsiveness.
The philosophy underlying this approach has been aptly summarized by Gray and Jenkins (1986, p. 171):
The guiding principles are the pursuit of efficiency, effectiveness and value for money: responsibility is to be decentralised, lower level operatives made aware of and accountable for the costs of their operations, targets are to be established and individuals assessed according to their ability to achieve them.
In brief we are offered a world where bureaucrats (and ministers) are redefined as accountable managers , public sector operations sub-divided into businesses , and the public seen as the customer .
The post-1979 managerial emphasis in central administration was not wholly new: indeed, it started from much the same principle as Fulton — that civil servants needed to adopt a more business-like approach and drew upon a number of Fulton's ideas about departmental organization (see Chapters 1 and 2).
What was new, however, is what Gray and Jenkins (1985, p. 127) call ‘organisational learning’: acting on experience gained from earlier failed attempts at administrative  reform.
For example, whereas Fulton suffered heavily from lack of civil service support, advocates of the new managerialism have emphasized the need to change the Whitehall culture in order to generate reform from within.
In order, moreover, to minimize departmental opposition — which had been instrumental in neutralizing the impact of PAR and the CPRS — departments have been given discretion in determining the pace and nature of managerial change.
In similar vein, recognizing departmental sensitivity about policy territories, the post 1979 initiatives have focused on efficient administration rather than policy.
To quote Gray and Jenkins (1985, p. 165) again: ‘The moves beyond Rayner to the FMI represent attempts to work within the political and organisation system, rather than against it and to couch debate in terms of means rather than ends’.
A further important contextual difference has been provided by ministerial attitudes.
Whereas momentum behind Fulton's reforms dissipated once they faded from ministerial agendas, post-1979 managerialism has derived considerable support from the Thatcher government.
Not only does it draw from what Pollitt (1986a, p. 159) describes as the ‘belief-system of the incoming Conservative government of 1979’— the crusade against bureaucratic waste, belief in the superiority of private sector managerial techniques and drive towards increased value for money — but it shares the same ideological roots as privatization and contracting out.
Indeed, improved managerial efficiency can be seen as the Thatcher government's alternative solution ‘for those parts of the public sector that could not be privatised or subjected to the sanitizing forces of the market’.
This ideological underpinning has been particularly significant, vesting the post-1979 managerialist reforms with what Metcalfe and Richards (1984, 1987) describe as ‘political clout’, a strong measure of personal support from the Prime Minister and her closest advisers.
Despite this political and ideological underpinning it is unlikely that the Thatcher government entered office with any grand strategy for the civil service.
Rather, developments have proceeded incrementally with early initiatives such as the Rayner Scrutiny Programme leading subsequently to the introduction of departmental management information systems and the Financial Management Initiative.
Collectively these three initiatives encompass the main thrust of the post-1979 managerial approach in central government, each of which will now be examined in turn.
The Rayner Scrutiny Programme
In 1979 Mrs Thatcher appointed Sir (now Lord) Derek Rayner, of Marks & spencer , as an adviser on administrative efficiency.
Supported  by a small ‘efficiency unit’— composed of both civil servants and outside consultants — and originally established as part of the Prime Minister's Office, Rayner's job was to stimulate improvements in administrative efficiency within Whitehall.
Subsequently the efficiency unit was relocated in the Management and Personnel Office, but in 1983 — when Sir Robin Ibbs (a former head of the CPRS and executive director of ICI) succeeded Rayner as the Prime Minister's Special Adviser on Efficiency — it was located physically in the Cabinet Office.
Throughout, both Rayner and Ibbs have enjoyed strong prime ministerial backing, ensuring ‘that civil servants (and ministers) in departments continued to take the Efficiency Unit's work seriously’(Metcalfe and Richards, 1987, p. 9).
One of Rayner's first acts was to set in train a series of efficiency scrutinies within Whitehall.
According to Rayner the objectives of the scrutiny programme were:
i)
to examine a specific policy or activity, questioning all aspects of work normally taken for granted;
ii)
to propose solutions to problems and to make recommendations to achieve savings and increase efficiency and effectiveness;
iii)
to implement agreed solutions, or to begin their implementation within 12 months of the start of a scrutiny (Rayner, 1982, para. 2.2).
Although these objectives refer to ‘efficiency’ and ‘effectiveness’, in practice the scrutiny programme has been mainly concerned with the third ‘E’, ‘economy’(for definitions see Chapter l), focusing mainly on cost reduction through streamlining administrative procedures.
As several authoritative inquiries (such as National Audit Office, 1986a, para. 2; Public Accounts Committee, 198–6, para. 8) have observed, few scrutinies — particularly in the period to 1983 — addressed effectiveness issues or those with major policy content.
Basically each efficiency scrutiny encompasses the following five main stages:
1
Setting up a strategy : All departments regularly suggest topics for scrutiny.
Most reviews concern departmental activities, although some have examined cross-departmental work (such as government forms and property management).
2
Investigation : Usually carried out by departmental staff, with reports submitted to the minister within ninety working days.
3
Action plan : Summarizing plans for implementing savings.
To be approved within three months of receipt of report.
4
Implementation : The responsibility of the departmental permanent secretary.
5
Implementation report : Summarizing action, savings and so forth achieved.
Produced within two years of start of scrutiny.
(Making Things Happen , 1985).
As the above indicates, the scrutiny process emphasizes action and implementation within a specified timetable.
The ‘key elements are radical questioning, direct observation, proposals based firmly on factual evidence and a sense of urgency’(ibid.).
According to Bray (1988) the underlying aim is to serve departmental needs.
Indeed, ‘Rayner had no right of entry into departments.
He could investigate by invitation only, and even then only in areas selected by the departments themselves’(quoted in Fry, 1988a, p. 6).
A crucial role in the scrutiny process is assigned to what is described as ‘top management’— the permanent secretary and deputy secretaries ‘acting as the top board of the department’— who are involved at every stage in the process.
Ministers also carry major responsibility, approving scrutiny topics, deciding action plans, and receiving implementation reports.
As Beesley (1983, p. 31) emphasizes, reviews rely ‘heavily on self-examination’ reflecting the belief ‘that Ministers and their officials are better equipped than anyone to examine the use of resources for which they are responsible’.
In the first six years a total of 266 reviews were conducted identifying annual savings of –600m with an additional 67m of one-off savings (Making Things Happen , 1985, p. 9).
Most reviews have identified administrative deficiencies — one scrutiny found it cost 90 to administer 100 of woodland grant — and some have led to major changes (such as the establishment of a non-Defence central purchasing unit: see Government Purchasing: A Review of Government Contract and Procurement Procedures , 1984).
By 1986 total savings were estimated at 950m against scrutiny costs of only 5m (Public Accounts Committee, 1985–6, para. 15).
By any standards these are impressive results.
Nevertheless, while many administrative shortcomings have been identified, the scrutiny technique does have inherent limitations.
Inevitably there is a tendency for departments to select ‘safe’ scrutiny topics and ignore findings they dislike.
The scrutiny approach is also arguably unsuitable where quick decisions are needed or where inefficiency arises from the inability of departmental staff rather than deficient procedures or systems (see Bray, 1988, p. 21).
Critics, moreover, argue that sacrifices in service quality have sometimes been necessary to obtain savings.
Many identified savings, furthermore, have not been realized: of the 600m annual savings identified by 1985, for example, only 295m had actually been implemented.
Of the shortfall, departments had assessed 80m as being unobtainable, and 65m had been rejected for political and other reasons (Making Things Happen , 1985).
Many scrutinies, moreover, are not completed within  the two-year time span, and departments have frequently been criticised for delays in implementation.
Although the scrutiny programme has received most publicity, Rayner also emphasized the need for ‘lasting reforms’ which would help remove the underlying causes of Whitehall inefficiency.
Broadly he identified two categories of reform: those relating to people (designed to produce changes in civil service culture), and those relating to institutions (designed to clarify arrangements for resource management).
While as Collins (1987, p. 14) observes, ‘few, if any of the scrutinies have borne directly on any of these concerns, a surprisingly large number…have led, directly or indirectly, to widespread changes in the management of central government’.
Two scrutinies, in particular, were crucially important: the first in 1979 led to the decision to implement a management information system for ministers (MINIS) in the Department of the Environment (DOE).
The second in 1981, known as the Joubert Study (after the official conducting it), devised a structure which divided the DOE into 120 cost centres as a basis for a financial management system (Collins, 1987, p. 15; Fry, 1984, p. 332).
These two scrutinies led directly to the two other major planks of the Thatcher government's managerial approach within central government; namely, MINIS and the Financial Management Initiative (FMI).
Management information system for ministers (MINIS)
In 1980, following a Rayner scrutiny, MINIS was introduced into the DOE.
Essentially a management tool, MINIS was strongly associated with Michael Heseltine who, as Secretary of State for the Environment, introduced MINIS into the DOE and subsequently, as Defence Secretary, into the Ministry of Defence (MOD).
As he explains (1987, pp. 19–20) the essential objective was to ‘find out what was happening in my department and who was responsible for making it happen, who had set the targets, what the targets were and whether they were being monitored.
Nobody could recall [these questions]being asked before’.
MINIS, at its simplest, represents ‘an…attempt to collect information about a Department's activities and to place responsibility for using this information with the Department's top management, Ministerial and official’(Richards, 1987, p. 26).
It enables departmental ‘top management’ to ascertain within their departments who does what, why and at what cost.
As initially developed in the DOE (Likierman, 1982; Whitbread, 1987) and later in the MOD (Omand, 1983) it involved three main stages:
1
Each section head prepares a statement of activities, staff numbers, achievements, and so forth; developing where possible performance  indicators (such as average time spent on each planning appeal).
2
These statements are considered by ministers and top management.
Section heads can be questioned about performance, objectives and so on.
3
Implementation of ministers' decisions arising from stage 2.
The process above is conducted annually — each cycle in MINIS parlance being known as a ‘round’— enabling performance to be analysed against plans, and information to be updated.
The effect is to bring ‘Ministers into the management structure of the Department’(Whitbread, 1987, p. 95), providing ‘a comprehensive grasp of the activities of the Department, with information-presented in a much more systematic way than was normally available through briefing by officials on particular issues or in response to particular requests’(Likierman, 1982, p. 130).
This, in turn, enables ministers and senior officials to review progress of departmental activities, monitor the effectiveness of policies, and to take resource allocation decisions ‘in accordance with ministerial priorities and objectives’(Bradley, 1983, p. 41).
It also offers a potential for assessing more accurately the effects of projected staffing or expenditure cuts and to identify any mismatch between departmental functions and ministerial objectives.
Significantly, following the introduction of MINIS into the DOE, directorates were reorganized and within four years departmental manpower fell by 15,000 (29 per cent)(Heseltine, 1987, p. 18).
As the government acknowledged (Efficiency and Effectiveness , 1982, para. 27), MINIS provided ministers ‘with a most valuable instrument to assist resource allocation’.
MINIS, it should be stressed, was not totally new.
A number of departments, prior to its introduction into the DOE, possessed systems for obtaining information about departmental activities, although the ‘more rigorous’ and comprehensive analysis offered by MINIS did represent a ‘real departure’(Likierman, 1982, p. 135).
MINIS, moreover, was an ongoing system capable of having refinements added over time.
In its early stages in the DOE, for example, it focused mainly on departmental structure, activities, and administrative expenditure, whilst by 1985–6 the system had been improved to include performance review reports and programme expenditure (Whitbread, 1987, p. 96).
Of course, such arrangements were not introduced without criticism.
Association with expenditure cuts, particularly at the DOE, aroused criticism among lower-level staff and public sector unions.
In the DOE it also tended to overburden top management, producing large amounts of detailed information about costs whilst ignoring both wider policy judgements (which perhaps offer greater scope for savings) and day-to-day political issues (which  usually preoccupy top civil servants and ministers).
Nevertheless, as McGill (1984, p. 25) notes, by the early 1980s MINIS-type arrangements were being seen in the UK public sector as something of a ‘management panacea’, with similar developments occurring beyond Whitehall within, for example, water authorities and local government.
Ultimately the attractiveness of MINIS-type systems to public sector managers lies in the comprehensive picture which they can provide of organizational activities, and also in the potential which they hold for decentralization within departments.
As Metcalfe and Richards (1987, p. 24) observe, departmental decentralization was a key theme to emerge from early Rayner scrutinies, the object being to push responsibility down the departmental hierarchy to where costs were being incurred.
MINIS, when properly developed, could identify and measure the performance of departmental cost centres, and thereby provide a potential for the comprehensive reorganization of departments based upon the principle of decentralization to managerially autonomous accountable units.
by no means a new concept — Fulton had strongly advocated the development of units of accountable management — such arrangements had previously proved difficult to introduce on a widespread scale owing largely to the difficulty of isolating discrete elements of departmental work.
MINIS, however, by dividing departmental work into discrete blocks, and summarizing the costs/objectives/achievements and so on of each, provided the basis for such a reorganization within the DOE.
Following the Joubert Study (see pp. 125) a computerized budget system (MAXIS) was installed into the DOE in 1983 and a network of 120 cost centres established, each controlled by a manager with budgetary responsibility for running costs including staff (Fry, 1984, p. 332;Financial Management in Government Departments , 1983, pp. 50–2).
Final budgets for each centre were then integrated into each MINIS round, and the Treasury and Civil Service Select Committee (1982, vol. 1, p. xi)— perceiving the implications for other departments — recommended the extension of MINIS ‘or its equivalent’ to all main central departments.
Although initially there was considerable opposition in Whitehall to such arrangements (Heseltine, 1987, pp. 22–3), the government was anxious to develop similar systems throughout Whitehall.
Accordingly in 1982 it announced that, while varying systems could be established to reflect differing departmental roles, all departments were to introduce ‘management systems like MINIS’ together with ‘a structure of organization’in which identifiable functions could be assigned to ‘responsibility centres’(Efficiency and Effectiveness , 1982, para. 29 and annex C).
The MINIS and Joubert systems, with due allowance for departmental differences, were to be universalized  throughout Whitehall, and it was this which provided the impetus for the launch of the Financial Management Initiative (FMI) in 1982.
The Financial Management Initiative (FMI)
The FMI, launched in May 1982, has been described by Gray and Jenkins (1986, p. 173; 1985, p. 124) as ‘a general approach rather than a single strategy’, and as ‘an umbrella under which a new management philosophy is being developed’.
It draws not only on the experience of Rayner scrutinies and MINIS, but also on the concept of management accounting (see pp. 11).
All departments were recommended on the launching of the FMI to establish a ‘management accounting system’ to be integrated as far as possible with ‘existing systems for the public expenditure survey, estimates, and appropriation accounts’(Efficiency and Effectiveness , 1982, app. 3).
Officially the aims of the FMI were to promote in each department an organization in which managers at all levels would have:
i
a clear view of their objectives and means to assess and, wherever possible, measure outputs or performance in relation to those objectives;
ii
well-defined responsibility for making the best use of resources including a critical scrutiny of output and value for money; and
iii
the information (particularly about costs), the training and access to expert advice that they need to exercise their responsibilities effectively (ibid., para. 13).
In keeping with these objectives departments were ‘called upon to examine the way they managed all aspects of their programmes and to work out the best pattern of managerial responsibility, financial accounting and control’(ibid., para. 14).
The initiative was coordinated by a specially created unit — comprising both civil servants and management consultants — known as the Financial Management Unit of the Cabinet Office (MPO) and the Treasury, which was replaced in 1985 by the Treasury/Cabinet Office Joint Management Unit.
In accordance with allowance for departmental variations, each department was left to formulate its own plans for implementing the FMI (see Financial Management in Government Departments , 1983 and Progress in Financial Management in Government Departments , 1984), producing a variety of patterns of implementation.
While these variations need to be borne in mind, four distinctive features of the FMI can be identified:
1 TOP MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
The White Paper launching the FMI (Efficiency and Effectiveness , 1982, para. 15)‘expected’ each department to establish ‘an information system that not only provides higher management with aggregated information needed for estimating and control, but managers at successive levels down the line with the information they need to do their job properly’.
In essence, what was envisaged was the construction of internal management systems around the hierarchical command structures characteristic of government departments (see Chapter 2).
By 1984 every department had reportedly ‘taken steps to introduce a top management system for Ministers and senior managers’, enabling these ‘to review regularly the department's aims, examine its ‘businesses’ and the ‘customers’they serve, set objectives, and establish priorities' (Progress in Financial Management in Government Departments , 1984, p. 3).
Although features varied between departments, most required each identifiable unit to report regularly to ‘top management’ on their structure, activities, and resources consumed.
Initially most systems concentrated on reviewing administrative activities and costs but subsequent refinements enabled them also to review programmes (that is, activities and costs covering a policy objective or a group of related policy objectives).
By 1985 many departments were reportedly using such systems to conduct annual reviews of departmental programmes and administrative work, and feeding results directly into public expenditure and parliamentary estimates exercises (Cabinet Office (MPO) /Treasury (FMU), 1985a, p. 1).
In practice, of course, the development of information systems presents considerable difficulties.
As Plowden (1985, p. 401) observes, ‘almost any information system exploiting modern technology is likely to generate too much information’.
In the DOE, for example, senior officials often became involved in lengthy discussions on minor matters at the expense of strategic discussion and analysis.
Many lower-level managers found MINIS time-consuming and unhelpful, while some also found it difficult to depict their work accurately.
There may also be a tendency, as the Public Accounts Committee (1986–7c, para. 23) has warned, for ‘top management systems…to be regarded as a substitute for FMI, rather than an integral part of it’.
While monitoring and refinements should bring improvements over time, clearly serious difficulties have been experienced with the development and utilization of departmental information systems.
2 STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Underlying the FMI is a belief that better use of resources requires a clearer definition of the objectives of expenditure, and as a first step all  departments were obliged to specify their objectives as a basis for determining priorities and measuring achievement.
On paper all have done so, although in reality most statements of departmental objectives have tended to be rather vague and generalized, describing functions or responsibilities rather than underlying goals or objectives (Financial Management in Government Departments , 1983; Gray and Jenkins, 1985, pp. 84–7).
Departments have also generally found it easier to establish objectives for administrative costs (which account for only 13 per cent of departmental expenditure) than for programme costs (87 per cent of departmental expenditure and, therefore, offering potentially much greater scope for savings)(Public Accounts Committee , 1986–7c, para. 30).
This relative lack of progress, of course, largely reflects the problems of goal-setting in the (generally) non-profit-oriented public sector.
In the absence of profit, objectives are usually more difficult to define, whilst many government departments and public agencies — and many of the programmes they administer — have multiple objectives.
Goal identification, moreover, is often inseparable in Whitehall from questions of policy, which gives rise to frequent conflict both within and between departments.
For these reasons goal-setting by departments has been fraught with problems, creating for those seeking to implement the FMI continual ‘difficulties created by imprecise, broad, policy objectives’(National Audit Office, 1986b, para. 13).
3 DECENTRALIZATION AND DELEGATION
A key feature of the FMI is delegated budgeting, a process requiring each department to ‘examine the scope for breaking its structure down into cost-centres or responsibility-centres to which resource costs can be allocated and for which, where appropriate, measures of output can be devised and monitored’(Efficiency and Effectiveness , 1982, Appendix 3).
The underlying idea is that cost-centre managers should become budget holders responsible for cost management and results, an arrangement contrasting with traditional departmental practice whereby finance and staffing are controlled by specialist establishment and finance divisions.
As Richards (1987, p. 29) observes, such central divisions ‘must be willing to…stand back and let the…[cost centre]manager succeed or fail, according to his or her own lights’.
Budgetary decentralization also has important personnel implications, requiring training initiatives to familiarize line managers with the accounting and other skills required to perform their new responsibilities.
In practice, progress in developing decentralized budgeting has varied considerably between departments.
Although most departments have drawn up plans, many areas of departmental work cannot easily be broken down into discrete cost centres.
Generally the scope  for such arrangements is least in departments dominated by HQ units engaged in policy work, and greatest in those with extensive local networks (such as the DHSS which had developed 800 cost centres by 1984, with individual managers having ‘to bid for their requirements’ and enjoying flexibility to switch funds between budget heads)(Progress in Financial Management in Government Departments , 1984, pp. 62–3).
Where this has happened, middle-level managers, according to Richards (1987, p. 27)‘for the first time in their working lives’ have been able ‘to see a connection between the activity they were authorising and the cost of carrying it out’.
This, coupled with cognate developments such as the dispersion of departmental functions to semi-autonomous agencies, has done much to extend cost consciousness and value-for-money considerations down the management line in accordance with the FMI's underlying principles.
Indeed, in April 1988 civil service manpower targets were dropped and a new regime of running-costs control imposed upon departments.
In future all department running costs will be cash limited with the intention of giving ‘individual civil service managers greater flexibility to make best uses of the resources available to them’(Hansard , H.C., VI, vol. 110, cols 933–4, 18 February 1987).
Nevertheless, while some impact has been made, overall progress has been limited.
Budgetary decentralization not only undermines the primacy of central establishments and finance divisions within departments, but also conflicts with the hierarchical command structure typically found in bureaucratic organizations.
Consequently in some departments the effective delegation of responsibility to lower-level managers has not always been pursued with enthusiasm by senior departmental officials.
Even where decentralized budgeting projects have been introduced, these have often taken the form of pilot projects or trials (Progress in Financial Management in Government Departments , 1984, especially Appendix 2), whilst the authority delegated to budget holders has often been severely constrained (not least by centrally determined manpower ceilings and pay scales).
Problems have also been experienced with providing cost-centre managers with sufficient incentives to manage resources economically, efficiently and effectively.
For such reasons overall progress with budgetary decentralization was described by the public Accounts Committee (1986–7c, paras 34–8) as having been so slow as to threaten ‘the [very]success of the FMI’.
4 PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
Essentially concerned with a comparative evaluation of inputs and outputs (see Chapter 1), performance measurement has long been recognized as important within Whitehall.
Until the 1980s, however, its development was limited to executive functions where inputs and outputs could be most easily identified and aligned (see Treasury and Civil Service Committee, 1982, vol. 111, Appendix 9).
With the subsequent adoption of top management systems, however, departments acquired enhanced capacity to identify costs, tasks, achievements and so on, and from the outset performance measurement was seen as an integral feature of the FMI, offering a tool for assessing progress with the attainment of departmental objectives and — since the Treasury's multi-departmental review of budgeting (HM Treasury, 1985; 1986a)— for linking cost-centre managers' budgets to output and achievement.
Performance measures are usually most helpful when used for comparisons: for example, between units performing similar tasks, or over time.
Measures can be of efficiency, effectiveness, economy or any other aspect of performance.
Initially under the FMI emphasis was placed upon measuring administrative functions .
Most departments have quantifiable running cost inputs (postage, staff, travel and so on) and outputs (such as payments, collections, caseloads) which can be used to develop performance measures such as accuracy (proportion of errors), timeliness (such as response time), throughput (such as number of cases dealt with) and unit cost (such as average cost per case/client).
Such measures in turn can be used to identify underperformance, set targets, appraise staff and reallocate resources (for examples see H.M.
Treasury 1986b, and 1987).
At a later stage the emphasis was switched from administrative to programme measurement (which — as costs may be spread amongst numerous departmental sections as well as outside agencies such as local authorities or quangos — is usually much more difficult).
In the DTI, for example, resource inputs into financial assistance schemes were measured against outputs (such as jobs created/safeguarded) enabling the cost-effectiveness of the programme to be assessed, and targets set for  future schemes (Progress in Financial Management in Government Departments , 1984, p. 103).
By 1985 according to the Financial Management Unit (Cabinet Office (MPO) /Treasury (FMU), 1985a, p 4)‘most departments [were]developing new (or strengthening existing) arrangements for reviewing programmes systematically each year’, and all departments were being urged to adopt similar procedures.
As a result, by the mid-1980s a wave of performance measures had been adopted.
The 1986 Public Expenditure White Paper, for example, referred to over 1,200 such measures — the majority in Whitehall departments — and by 1987 the figure had increased to 1,810.
Undoubtedly performance measurement was being widely used as a tool for measuring value for money not only in Whitehall but also in outside agencies (such as quangos) involved in implementing departmental programmes (Cabinet Office (MPO) /Treasury (FMU), 1984a).
At the same time problems have been much in evidence.
Assessment is costly in manpower and time, and much government work is difficult to measure: consultancy, inspection, and review activities, for example, pose special problems, while as Beeton (1987, p. 78) observes, ‘by 1986 no department had begun to measure performance of its policy makers, finding the quality and effectiveness of advice too difficult to quantify’.
Moreover, inputs and particularly outputs are often difficult to quantify, and sometimes even to identify.
Too often in the public sector final outputs become reducible to vague and unquantifiable notions of public good, which leads in many cases to the measurement instead of more easily quantified — but possibly misleading-intermediate outputs.
For example an advance factory programme should ideally be measured by additional benefit to a region's economy, but in practice intermediate measures such as jobs created may be used instead (National Audit Office, 1986b, para. 13).
Sometimes performance measures obscure, or even undermine, policy objectives.
A target for reduced hospital waiting lists, for example, may — by reducing hospital stays — actually impair patients' health.
Partly because of such difficulties the development of meaningful and quantifiable output measures has not occurred for many areas of departmental activity.
One Treasury review (1985, p. 19) candidly admitted, ‘What has been achieved so far amounts to an impressive array of intermediate indicators…there are, as yet, relatively few links…between inputs and outputs which show managers how changes in resources and priorities can lead to changes in output…
Performance measures still impact only slightly on resource allocation decisions’.
Certainly the measurement of programme expenditure has lagged far behind that of administrative expenditure (National Audit Office, 1986b, para 12), while ‘little progress’ has also apparently been made with integrating performance measurement with the public expenditure survey and parliamentary supply procedures (Richards, 1987, pp. 28–9)— a development much sought after by the Financial Management Unit.
As Beeton (1987, pp. 88–9) concludes, the government was unable to ‘master a comprehensive range across all their spending programmes.
Particularly striking [was]the failure to find, or agree on, measures or acceptable proxies of final output…
Some measures used [were]ambiguous, misleading or open to manipulation by managers’.
This latter difficulty, possible manipulation by managers, is found with practically all performance indicators, with gaming often being practised both to meet targets and to downgrade aspects of performance not specifically measured.
A further charge is that, being introduced in an era of expenditure restraint, performance measurement has focused largely on measuring, and minimizing, inputs (costs and manpower).
Gray (1986, pp. 11, 16) sees ‘little evidence of genuine assessment beyond the establishment of  a few input indicators’, and suggests that we are witnessing ‘the ascendancy of economy and efficiency over effectiveness and efficacy’.
The emphasis is upon input cost minimization, with wider questions of quality, customer satisfaction, and policy outcomes being largely ignored.
Similarly, Plowden (1985, p. 407) complains that the focus is ‘almost entirely on the costs of governmental activities rather than on their quality’.
How far, he asks (p. 399),
are the relatively simple techniques relating to the facts about costs and outputs — numbers of staff, numbers of applications dealt with capable of being developed to deal with far more complex questions about outcomes: what did this activity actually achieve, in terms of modernizing British industry…improving the nation's health, or educating it for the 21st century?
Pollitt (1986a, pp. 168–9) draws attention to one further problem: namely that performance measurement in the public sector is ‘at root a…political question’.
Performance criteria are often ‘value-laden’ and raise ‘perennially awkward, political question[s]’.
There is also ‘the problem of how to aggregate different judgements of performance’ which presents ‘formidable difficulties of principle and practice’.
In 1985 a Financial Management Unit report (Cabinet Office (MPO) /Treasury (FMU) 1985b, p. 1) admitted that as a policy-analysis tool the FMI left ‘scope for very considerable further improvement’.
It particularly noted the setting of imprecise goals, hidden assumptions underlying policies, and a failure to test the link between policy and impacts on the outside world.
A further point is that departmental officials (and client groups) might feel threatened by the policy implications of performance measurement, as might ‘a Cabinet of ministers committed to a party programme and to ways of winning the next general election’(Lee, 1984, p. 5).
In part, as Gray and Jenkins (1985, p. 165) suggest, these problems are the price paid for departmental acceptance of the FMI.
The effect, however, has been to produce what they describe (1984, p. 425) as ‘managerial myopia’, a fixation with short-term managerial innovation at the expense ‘of that long-term focus which is essential for achieving programme and policy effectiveness’.
Can the FMI realistically be extended to the study of policy effects without alienating those within the administrative and political community-ministers, departmental policy makers, and client groups — whom such developments might threaten?
This (as yet unresolved) dilemma is not only crucial to the FMI's future.
It also raises important questions about the role of civil servants in effecting managerial change, and about the FMI's compatibility with concepts of fundamental importance to public administration.
Implementing the FMI: political clout or cultural change?
The FMI was not intended to be implemented immediately, but was to develop over time, and at a different pace in different departments.
Consequently in the first six years implementation was patchy.
Progress was greater, for example, with developing management systems than with defining objectives, decentralization was developed more readily in field offices than in headquarters and policy divisions, and performance measurement applied more easily to inputs than outputs, and to administrative rather than programme expenditure.
Part of the explanation for this patchy development may lie in what Richards (1987, p. 36) calls the ‘fragmentation of the institutional arrangements within central government for guiding the changes’.
These include, according to Gray (1986, p. 18), ‘the Treasury (in a number of guises), the [former]Management and Personnel Office (especially the Management Efficiency Division), the Efficiency Unit, the Joint Management Unit, and even (in the wings) the National Audit Office’.
Some of these overlap, and their respective roles are a mystery to spending departments.
Nevertheless, progress has been made.
Several studies, for example, suggest that departmental productivity, in so far as it can be measured, has improved significantly in recent years.
The FMI, some claim, is now ‘a question of internal management rather than political initiative’, and future governments will maintain it to secure ‘the best possible value from limited resources’(Peat Marwick, 1986, p. 15).
Johnson,(1985, pp. 428, 432) feels ‘that the priority given to effective and efficient management by the civil service will endure’; and Greenaway (1987, p. 53) sees it as ‘inconceivable…that recent developments in these areas will simply be reversed following a change of Government’.
Even so, a cautionary note must be sounded.
The FMI's emphasis upon managerial efficiency as opposed to policy, and the obstacles political as well as technical-to developing effective performance measures of programme (as opposed to administrative) expenditure, inevitably limits achievable savings.
As Fry (1988a, p. 10) notes, ‘The running costs of government departments…are dwarfed by programme expenditure, the sheer scale of which…make the savings obtained from cash limits, staff reductions, the Rayner scrutinies and the FMI seem relatively unimportant’.
Progress within departments in implementing the FMI, moreover, has sometimes been limited.
For example, in 1987, a Public Accounts Committee report (1986–7c, paras 20, 44) claimed that ‘a major effort’ was needed to speed up implementation of the FMI.
For ‘some’ departments ‘full implementation [was]still many years away’.
The committee was ‘particularly concerned about the relatively slow progress of the Home Office’ and felt that it  would be ‘a long period of years’before systems in the Ministry of Defence could be relied on.
Five years after the FMI's launch, in other words, full implementation was still a long way off and ultimate success was far from assured.
While recognizing the difficulties inherent in implementing the FMI, the slow progress recorded suggests at least some lack of consensus within Whitehall.
Gray and Jenkins (1984, p. 425) point to intraorganizational tensions created by the FMI: for example, between service departments on the one hand and the Treasury (and formerly also the Management and Personnel Office) on the other, with the latter fearing loss of control over departmental expenditure and manpower.
Within departments, too, strains may be caused as establishment and finance responsibilities are decentralized from headquarters to new responsibility centres.
As Fry (1988a, p. 17) observes, without ‘devolved powers’ for managers ‘to decide the terms and conditions…of officials in their cost centre’— powers which central departments and departmental top management have been reluctant to concede —‘the impact of the FMI seems bound to be…relatively restricted’.
Again, FMI developments have aroused tensions among middle- and lower-management grades, not only through fears about jobs and increased central monitoring, but concern also that financial  stringency could impact on staff development and training ‘with longer term consequences for an efficient and effective Civil Service’(Public Accounts Committee, 1986–7c, para. 39).
Tensions may also arise through departmental clients perceiving the FMI as a threat to service provision.
Intra-organizational tensions within Whitehall, in other words, compounded by the concerns of civil service unions and public sector consumers, may have impeded development of consensus about the FMI.
A further obstacle concerns the skills needed to implement the FMI.
As Plowden (1985, p. 407) comments, ‘few ministers know the first thing about running large organisations’ whilst civil servants are generally not trained in financial and management skills.
Since the FMI's launch some attempt has been made to address these problems through courses at the Civil Service College, and more generally through what Tyson (1987, p. 70) describes ‘as a long-term process of personal development and change’(see also Financial Management in Government Departments , 1983, pp. 7–8).
In addition, following the Cassels Report (1983) a Personnel Work Action Programme was launched, key elements of which included more effective staff appraisal and incentives such as merit pay (see Progress in Financial Management in Government Departments , 1984, p. 7;The Times , 26 November 1986, and Fry, 1988a, pp. 13–14).
At lower levels, too, cost-centre managers have been given more flexibility with personnel management providing a greater link between performance and promotion (Thorpe 
Tracey, 1987, pp. 334–5).
Johnson (1985, pp. 424–5) also cites prime ministerial intervention in promoting top civil servants, and the increasing frequency of appointments to senior posts from outside the service (such as Peter Levene recruited from the private sector to head the Defence Procurement Executive in 1985) as evidence of ‘a more active personnel policy’ designed to enhance managerial competence.
While such developments may herald profound changes for the future, their full effects must take time to work through.
The civil service provides its staff with fewer incentives to encourage efficiency than in the private sector (where bonus, commissions, ‘perks’ etc. are often widespread), a position unlikely to be altered much by limited experimentation with merit pay and the like.
Fry (1984, p. 334) claims to detect ‘little obvious sign of…change’ from the traditionally ‘comfortable world of established pay scales…routine career expectations, and security of tenure’.
Indeed, introduced as they have been in a climate of manpower cuts by an allegedly insensitive senior management, the main effects of these developments may be to produce ‘not just disgruntled employees’ but also ‘ineffective organisation’(Plowden, 1985, p. 410).
More fundamentally, cultural changes of the kind envisaged by the FMI's sponsors may not have been forthcoming.
As Richards (1987, p. 27) observes ‘the fundamental, if unstated objective of the [FMI]was to transform the culture of Whitehall, supplementing the primarily administrative values…with other values…directed at managerial effectiveness’.
Some observers suggest that important changes have already occurred.
Cassels (1985, p. 36), for example, feels that the FMI ‘has changed the culture in departments a lot already’, and Johnson (1985, p. 432) that ‘a gradual transformation in ethos’ has occurred which will produce ‘by the end of the century a civil service qualitatively different in decisive respects from that…created by the great reforms of the last century’.
If these observers are correct then the FMI's future development will presumably be secured from within by a civil service committed to bringing about ‘lasting reforms’.
These developments of course(and herein lies the difficulty of gauging progress), may be more apparent than real.
As Pollitt notes (1986a, p. 165)‘a government can force its employees to go through the motions, but it cannot mandate enthusiasm and commitment’.
Metcalfe and Richards (1984, p. 451) also emphasize the ‘impoverished concept of management’ within the service, and its cultural bias towards defensiveness and risk avoidance.
They point also (1987, pp. 18–19) to an entrenched ‘disbelief system’ which includes scepticism about attempted reforms and a belief-far from groundless — that such reforms often fail.
Chapman (1984b, pp. 1–2) points similarly to the downgrading of ‘management’ within ‘the administrative culture of the British Civil Service’, and Howells (1981) to the contrast with  attitudes in the private sector where managerial work generally carries much higher prestige than in Whitehall.
There is also the point that the civil service will continue to require officials who are not primarily good managers but whose ability lies in policy work, drafting papers and sensitivity to ministerial needs.
This, too, must present a barrier to cultural changes of the kind required by the FMI.
While cultural attitudes within the service, under the impact of the FMI, may be changing, Metcalfe and Richards' view (1984, p. 452) is that the initial impact of the FMI probably owes more to ‘political clout…the repeated confirmation of Prime Ministerial backing’ than to genuine cultural change.
If this conclusion is correct then either much more may need to be done to force changes in the underlying culture of Whitehall, or the FMI may be laid ‘to rest as soon as the architect [Mrs Thatcher]is removed’(Gray and Jenkins, 1984, p. 427).
Managerialism and public administration
The managerialist initiatives described above represent an attempt to implant into central government selected managerial practices and cultural attitudes derived from the private sector.
The focus is upon better management and greater resource consciousness, emphases which are undoubtedly valuable in themselves, but which pose fundamental problems given the nature and distinctiveness of the public sector.
In particular there are implications for the policy/ administration dichotomy, equity and accountability (see Chapter 1).
i) THE POLICY/ADMINISTRATION DICHOTOMY
The focus of the efficiency strategy and FMI is premised on the view that ‘maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of government delivered services’ lies basically, with ‘better management’(Pollitt, 1986a, p. 157).
The emphasis, in other words, is upon good management rather than policy, an approach influenced partly by the need to minimize opposition from policy-conscious Whitehall departments, and partly because in the private sector-from which the managerial approach has largely been adopted — decision-making usually has only a limited policy content.
However, in the public sector, resource management considerations are usually much more difficult to disentangle from policy.
Thus Likierman (1985, p. 18) warns against efforts to mark a divide between ‘policy and implementation’.
It is too simplistic, he suggests, to attempt ‘to put the value-laden issues of politics to one side…and focus on the more limited issues of how to perform tasks more efficiently’.
This point is of more than theoretical significance.
As already  observed, allocating resources in the public sector is often a highly political exercise.
Thus, ‘responsible managers’ seeking value for money under the FMI might find themselves confronting policy issues.
(For example, they may wish to increase staff at a time when government is committed to reducing civil service numbers.)
In government, in other words, ends cannot be divorced from means, nor policy from management.
To quote Lee (1984, p. 5), behind the FMI ‘lie many unanswered questions…
[The]political function [of ministers and departments]cannot be easily translated into the language of financial management’.
ii) EQUITY
The managerial approach also has important implications for the concept of equitable administration.
The idea of decentralization to departmental units of accountable management not only undermines the hierarchical authority structure traditionally used in bureaucracies to enforce equitable application of departmental rules (see p. 26), but its underlying aim, as Gray and Jenkins (1985, p. 157) warn, ‘may be to downgrade…the search for fairness and equity of treatment…since such practices may not be value for money ’, In the private sector, where equity is less important (and in some cases absent), the search for value for money conflicts with no particular value systems, but in the public sector it does.
iii) ACCOUNTABILITY
The concept of accountability — especially external accountability — is also much more pronounced in the public than in the private sector (see p. 9), and the FMI, by delegating responsibilities to line managers and accountable units, conflicts sharply with the traditional pattern of accountability in central administration.
Whereas the convention of ministerial responsibility holds ministers accountable for all departmental work (see Chapter 14), the FMI assigns to departmental cost-centre managers responsibility for securing value for money.
As Lee (1984, p. 5) suggests, ‘on the face of it, the [FMI]should mean that ministers cannot be held responsible for actions taken by their officials under the new delegated responsibilities’.
These developments, it can be argued, far from weakening Whitehall accountability may strengthen it.
The FMI not only provides ministers (through management information systems) with increased knowledge about departmental activities, but also reinforces what Gray and Jenkins (1985, ch. 6) describe as the traditional legal rational code of accountability with a primarily financial code stressing effective and efficient accountability.
There has also, theoretically  at least, been a shift from ministerial to civil service accountability, arguably mirroring the fact that ministers today rarely accept personal responsibility for their officials' mistakes (see Chapter 14).
This development, when seen alongside the now routine questioning of civil servants by ‘Commons select committees (see Chapter 14), presents the possibility of ‘responsible’ departmental managers answering directly to MPs for their stewardship.
As Robinson (1985, p. 42) puts it, ‘the FMI merely adds a new twist to the whole question of…civil servants’ answerability to Parliament'.
Nevertheless, constitutionally, ministerial responsibility is incompatible with the FMI.
While those taking a ‘realistic’ view (believing that the convention no longer applies in true form) do not regard this as a problem, adherents to the ‘traditional’view (mainly academics and some senior civil servants) argue that it is (Robinson et al .,
1987, especially pp. 62–8).
One academic, Jones (ibid., p. 65), argues that, because of the implications for ministerial responsibility, the FMI should be ‘terminated’, while Gray and Jenkins (1985, p. 161) feel that the weakening of the convention, together with increased reliance upon professional codes — such as the values of auditors and accountants — may lead to ‘the disintegration of…accountability itself’.
These views stress the difficulty of harmonizing essentially private sector norms with traditional public sector concepts and constitutional requirements.
Perhaps the likeliest outcome, however, is that little will change.
Metcalfe and Richards (1984, p. 51) suggest that continuing attachment to constitutional norms will make civil servants reluctant to exercise managerial discretion.
Plowden' (1985, p. 400) foresees a similar possibility, that ministers' constitutional responsibility, coupled with sophisticated information systems, will produce increased ministerial intervention, ‘frustrating the intentions to give officials the discretion they need to manage effectively’.
Again, while the idea that officials exercising delegated authority should be directly accountable to Parliament may seem logical, it ignores the political reality of government domination which has traditionally characterized executive/legislative relationships in Britain.
Significantly, the government, when launching the FMI, rejected recommendations of the Treasury and Civil Service Committee (1982) designed to strengthen Parliament's role (for example, by enabling departmental select committees to request the Comptroller and Auditor General to review departmental efficiency and effectiveness).
While, therefore, the FMI might provide a potential for developing greater, or at least different, accountability, it seems unlikely, at least in the short term, to bring significantly increased accountability to Parliament for the work of central administration.
As Gray and Jenkins (1985, p. 165) put it, the FMI ‘might allow a change in the public image of accountability without much affecting its practice’.
Public administration or public management?
At root the managerialist approach assumes that private sector managerial techniques can be smoothly implanted into the public sector.
But is this the case?
Certainly, on the evidence to date, the savings achieved by efficiency scrutinies, the enhanced departmental knowledge available to ministers through information systems, and the increased resource consciousness among civil servants brought about by the FMI, would suggest that the public sector has much to gain by the introduction of managerial techniques originated in the private sector.
What has also emerged, however, is that private sector attitudes and techniques cannot easily be transplanted into central administration.
The policy implications of resource management and the administrative culture of Whitehall, departmental policy interests and the political orientations of ministers, concerns about equity and accountability, and the technical difficulties of effective performance measurement, all stand as obstacles to further progress, obstacles which may not be removed easily in the absence of a powerful central authority to co-ordinate and force the pace of future change.
Of course, some of these difficulties may be surmounted if the structure of Whitehall is itself radically altered, with departmental policy-making effectively separated from executive functions carried out by semi-autonomous agencies as proposed in the 1988 Ibbs Next Steps Report (see Chapter 2).
What perhaps all this suggests is that public administration is more than private management writ public.
The public sector has a political environment, theoretical foundations, an ethos, a culture and a sheer diversity which makes it distinctive from the private sector.
Perhaps, also, civil service culture can only be truly changed by changing the civil service itself, not through retraining and re-educating existing officials, but by wholesale — albeit inevitably long-term — changes in personnel through new recruitment practices and procedures.
Failure to recognize and to allow for this may explain why, even after nine years of Thatcherite ‘political clout’, doubt still exists about the extent of real cultural change within Whitehall and whether ‘lasting reforms’ have, or ever will be, achieved.
8 LOCAL GOVERNMENT: THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND POLITICAL CONTEXT
Administrative complexity
British local government superficially appears straightforward with its neat pattern of elected local authorities.
In practice, however government at the local level is particularly confusing because of the variety of agencies which help to shape and administer local services.
This complex web includes: a) local and regional offices of central government departments, such as the DSS and DOE (see Young 1982); b) non-departmental public bodies usually dealing with a single specialized function, such as health and water authorities; c) decentralized units of public corporations, such as electricity boards; d) innumerable autonomous and semi-autonomous official and quasi-official organizations, each with its part to play in the policy-making process, such as tenants' liaison committees and youth service advisory councils (see Cousins, 1982, 1983); e) elected local government (see Figure 8.2).
Complexity is compounded because of the large number of non-governmental agencies operating locally; these include local political parties, local pressure groups, professional bodies, and industrial and commercial concerns.
All of these can, on occasions, be important elements in local policy-making (Dunleavy and Rhodes, 1987).
The main focus of this chapter is elected local government, but this in itself is organizationally far from simple.
There are 514 principal local authorities in Great Britain: 404 authorities in England, 65 in Scotland and 45 in Wales.
Throughout the ‘shire’ areas of England, the whole of Wales and mainland Scotland there are two tiers of multipurpose local authorities.
Between 1974 and 1986 there had also been two tiers in Greater London and the six metropolitan counties in England, but this position was changed from 1 April 1986, when the upper-tier authorities were abolished.
Their functions were transferred partly to lower-tier authorities, partly to new single-purpose joint authorities and in part to the Secretary of State.
Outside the metropolitan areas, complex vertical relationships (such as those between county councils and district councils) co-exist  alongside horizontal relationships (such as those between different district councils within the same county).
Additionally, there are invariably complicated networks of relationships between different departments within a single local authority.
As Stanyer (1976, ch. 1) reminds us, it is important to see each locality as a miniature political and administrative system in its own right, a point reinforced by the Widdicombe Report (1986, p. 22) when the committee emphasized that ‘some of the commonly held assumptions about local government are valid only in a minority of authorities’.
Generalizing about local government can be hazardous.
Development and structure
Elected local government is big business.
In Great Britain there are some 20,650 district and borough councillors and some 4,100 county, regional and islands councillors.
This averages out at one councillor for every 2,200 members of the population although as Widdicombe (1986, paras 213–16) notes there are major disparities.
In Birmingham, for example, there is one councillor for every 8,600 people.
In Powys, on the other hand, there is one for every 590 people.
These authorities employ some 2.35m staff (1987) and, collectively, they are responsible for providing over fifty different services.
Their scale is demonstrated by the fact that just over 25 per cent of all public sector spending in Britain is accounted for by local authorities.
Indeed, if local authorities were listed in terms of expenditure, 89 authorities would appear amongst the top 500 British companies.
Quite clearly, local government deserves a major place in any study of British public administration.
THE TRADITIONAL PATTERN
The major features of local government in England and Wales were laid down by the 1835 Municipal Corporations Act and by three statutes at the end of the nineteenth century: the Local Government Acts of 1888 and 1894, and the London Government Act, 1899.
These Acts created a comprehensive pattern of local authorities throughout England and Wales providing a wide range of services.
With some modifications the structure lasted until the 1972 Local Government Act ushered in a new pattern of elected local administration which became operative from 1 April 1974, although this was further amended by the 1985 Local Government Act.
Figure 8.1 outlines the structure of local government in England and Wales immediately prior to 1 April 1974.
There were, however, a number of weaknesses in the traditional pattern, notably:
(i)
Outdated structure .
When the local government map was laid down at the end of the nineteenth century, many of the administrative units — for example, Anglo-Saxon shires and medieval boroughs — were already outdated.
During the twentieth century, as the residential pattern of communities changed, the local government structure became increasingly irrational.
(ii)
Disparities of size .
The above factors also produced wide disparities between local authorities of the same type, often producing a mismatch between resources and functions.
In particular, many authorities were too small to provide an efficient standard of service (for example , the smallest housing authority, Tintwistle RDE, had a population of only 1,490).
(iii)
Administrative confusion .
There were nine different types of elected local authority.
In the more built-up areas services were often provided by all-purpose county boroughs; however, in rural areas services were split between the county council and urban/rural district/municipal borough authorities.
County councils, moreover, frequently subdivided their territory for administrative purposes.
Education and social services, for example, were invariably administered from decentralized ‘area’ offices as well as from County Hall.
From the consumer's standpoint, in particular, the ‘old’ system was therefore frequently extremely complex.
(iv)
Fragmentation of responsibility .
In many areas local services were provided by numerous different authorities, which often gave rise to acute co-ordination problems.
Imagine, for example, the difficulties of community-wide planning on Merseyside where there were twenty-three local authorities (excluding parishes).
The pre-April 1974 structure of local government in England and Wales (as at March 1974).
REORGANIZATION
Structural change always needs to be seen in its environmental context.
As society evolved from the end of the nineteenth century, so pressure for local government reorganization increased.
In London, population movement from inner London to the suburbs meant that the old London County Council's administrative network had largely outlived its usefulness and in 1957 the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London was established to examine the London conurbation, including the Home Counties.
This reported in 1960 (the Herbert Report), and in 1963 the London Government Act set a broad boundary to the London area and gave shared  responsibility for its local services to the Greater London Council (GLC), and to thirty-two London boroughs and the City of London.
Until its abolition on 31 March 1986 strategic planning functions resided with the top tier (GLC), while more personal services were administered by the boroughs.
In addition, some services were shared under special arrangements (for example , education in inner London was made the responsibility of the Inner London Education Authority which initially consisted of members of the GLC from inner London plus a representative from each of the inner London boroughs), while others continue to be the sole responsibility of special agencies (the Metropolitan Police, for instance , answers directly to the Home Secretary).
In 1990 ILEA is scheduled to be abolished with the relevant boroughs taking the education function back to themselves
In 1966 two separate Royal Commissions were established to investigate local government in England (excluding London) and Scotland.
When the Redcliffe-Maud Commission (on England) reported in 1969 it recommended the abolition of the old structure and the establishment of a new pattern of local authorities.
Its solution, outside the urban conurbations, was unitary multi-purpose authorities (with from 250,000 to 1 m inhabitants).
The existing two-tier system, it recommended, should be replaced by fifty-eight unitary authorities which would cover most of the country, but in three metropolitan areas there was to be a two-tier arrangement with responsibilities divided between a metropolitan county council and large district authorities (along lines similar to those then operating in Greater London).
While the Labour government basically accepted these proposals (see Local Government Reform in England , 1970) the Conservatives, who came to power in 1970, produced alternative ideas which were ultimately incorporated into the 1972 Local Government Act.
The concept of unitary authorities was rejected in favour of a rationalized two-tier system.
The Conservatives argued that the size of authority recommended by Redcliffe-Maud (serving populations between 250,000 and 1 m) was  too large; hence the need for a division of responsibilities between county and districts.
Interestingly, the Wheatley Commission on Scotland also favoured a two-tier system.
Likewise Derek Senior's minority report to the Royal Commission on Local Government in England favoured a two-tier system, although one based on the concept of the city region.
The Conservative government's proposals divided the whole of England and Wales into two major tiers (plus parish councils as a third tier).
The first tier was to be based largely on existing counties; the major changes were destined to take place in the second tier, the district level.
Parish councils (community councils in Wales) made up the third tier which had both minor service and advisory functions at grass-roots level.
THE NEW SYSTEM IN ENGLAND AND WALES
Outside Greater London, a reorganized local government system was created by a series of Acts of Parliament passed during the period 1972–4.
The 1985 and 1988 Local Government Acts further modified structures both inside and outside London (see below), p. 148.
The 1972 Local Government Act abolished the eighty-three county boroughs in England and Wales and reduced the fifty-eight county councils to forty-seven, ranging from populations of 110,000 (Powys) to 1.5m (Hampshire).
Within these counties, 1,250 municipal boroughs, urban and rural district councils were replaced by 333 district councils with populations ranging from 396,000 (Bristol) to 21,500 (Radnor).
In the major urban conurbations six metropolitan counties (Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West Midlands, Tyne and Wear, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire) were created containing thirty-six metropolitan districts with populations ranging from 158,000 (South Tyneside) to almost 1.1m (Birmingham).
As noted above, however, on 31 March 1986 these six metropolitan counties along with the GLC were abolished and their functions largely relocated to metropolitan district councils (boroughs in London) or to non-directly elected joint boards.
A significant proportion of urban England, therefore, now has only one tier of elected local government.
As a third tier, parish councils have been retained in England (known as community councils in Wales).
There are some 10,204 parish councils in England and 808 community councils in Wales.
Small parishes (with under 200 electors) may instead hold parish meetings which all local electors can attend.
Additionally, in some urban areas neighbourhood councils have been formed but these have no statutory functions and merely provide a sounding board for local opinion.
Figure 8.2 provides a summary of the present pattern of local government in England and Wales.
Local authorities in England and Wales, 1988.
THE NEW SYSTEM IN SCOTLAND
In Scotland ‘modern’ local government was established by Acts of 1889, which created county councils, and 1900, which regularized town government.
At the third tier, parish councils were created in 1894 and charged with administering poor relief.
Just as the development of Scottish local government closely paralleled that in England so, too, its ‘reform’ followed closely on the heels of English and Welsh reorganization.
The (Wheatley) Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland (1966–9) saw its proposals (1969) largely adopted by the Conservative government in the Local Government (Scotland) Act, 1973, which became effective in May 1975.
As in England, the Scottish Commission identified large numbers of small authorities as a major weakness of the old system.
The ‘new’ pattern saw fewer, larger authorities.
There are now nine regional councils (ranging from Strathclyde with 2.3m inhabitants down to the Borders with 101,000) and fifty-three district councils (ranging from 744,000 in Glasgow to 10,000 in Badenoch and Strathspey).
In addition, three island authorities were given virtually all-purpose status.
At the third-tier level are some 1,350 community councils.
Figure 8.3 presents the contemporary Scottish structure in diagrammatic form.
Local government in Scotland since May 1975.
The post-1974 pattern of local government throughout Britain appears substantially different from that which it replaced.
But to what extent did the changes constitute ‘reform’?
A major objective of the reform movement was the rationalization of geographical areas with the aim of producing more efficient services, yet some very small organizational units still provide crucial services (such as housing, education, social services).
With reorganization, moreover, local government lost some important services to other agencies.
Under the Water Act (1973) the powers hitherto exercised by English and Welsh local authorities in water supply and sewage disposal were transferred to ten new regional water authorities.
Likewise, in 1974 local authority health powers in England and Wales were transferred to newly created, non-elected health authorities (see Chapter 13).
ABOLITION OF THE GLC AND THE ‘MET’ COUNTIES
As noted above there was further structural change in the 1980s.
The 1983 Conservative Party manifesto argued (p. 37) that the six metropolitan county councils and the GLC had ‘been shown to be a wasteful and unnecessary tier of government’.
In a White Paper,Streamlining the Cities (1983), the Conservative government set out its case for further structural change.
The government argued that the six ‘mets’ and the GLC were a superfluous tier of government, very much junior partners to their constituent district (borough) councils in terms of service provision.
Additionally it was maintained that the GLC and the six ‘mets’ had sought an outlet for their energies by developing a general strategic role which had led to conflict with lower-tier authorities (such as on land use planning) and to duplication (such as on economic development).
There was also conflict with central government as authorities assumed a ‘mandate’ on issues such as defence and foreign policy.
With their large rate base and relative remoteness from ratepayers the White Paper argued that they had pursued unrealistic spending policies.
The government anticipated a financial saving of at least –120m a year with abolition, but denied that the change would undermine local democracy.
Indeed, the White Paper maintained that there would, in fact, be enhanced local accountability as the more accessible boroughs and districts would be responsible for a fuller range of services.
After what was often an acrimonious debate the 1985 Local Government Act ultimately emerged.
It abolished the six ‘mets’ and the GLC with effect from 31 March 1986.
These seven authorities had constantly exceeded government expenditure targets and had frequently engaged in ‘socialist’ policies which hardly endeared them to the Thatcher government.
One of the most controversial aspects of the 1985 Act was the way in  which crucially important services hitherto provided by the GLC and the six ‘mets’ were transferred not to elected second-tier authorities but to non-directly elected joint boards.
The major spending services of the Metropolitan counties (police, fire, public transport and probation), which accounted for some 70 per cent of their expenditure, were transferred to such joint boards (notably Fire and Civil Defence Boards, Police Boards, Transport Boards).
These are composed largely of local councillors indirectly appointed by their local authority but not directly elected to these bodies.
Some commentators see such developments as further evidence of the erosion of local democracy.
In London the post-April 1986 picture became particularly complex.
By 1987 there were some seventy-seven successor bodies to the GLC — some statutory such as the Fire, Civil Defence and Waste Disposal boards, but mostly voluntary with boroughs co-operating in groups such as the Greater London Ecology Unit and the London Boroughs Grant Scheme (with leading boroughs operating on an agency basis).
Other former GLC functions went to the Thames Water Authority, Arts Council, Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission, and English Heritage.
Still others went to the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment.
About a dozen services were transferred to the directly elected London boroughs.
From 1986, when the GLC was abolished, the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) became a directly elected body although the 1988 Local Government Act abolished ILEA with effect from April 1990, the educational function being transferred to the relevant Inner London boroughs.
It seems clear that, despite the Conservative government's emphasis on decentralization and accountability as objectives of abolition in London, the net result has been an increase in centralization and a reduction of both financial and democratic accountability.
There were seventeen precepting bodies operating in the first year of the new system and a larger number of ad hoc bodies which could levy funds.
This fragmentation following the 1986 restructuring produced a lack of co-ordination and an absence of overall control.
Additionally, of course, such a diverse distribution of services amongst so many bodies is a potential nightmare for the ordinary consumer.
From the ‘street level bureaucracy’ standpoint there appeared to be little sense in the new arrangements and they were frequently viewed as the product of political pragmatism rather than administrative reasoning.
The post-1972 period has thus witnessed important structural changes in British local administration.
But, as Stanyer (1976, p. 55) has observed: ‘It is necessary to understand what a local authority is in legal terms in a particular governmental system only as a prelude to understanding what all local authorities are in behavioural terms’.
The structures created between 1963 and 1988 provided a new administrative   framework for local government but such structures in themselves reveal relatively little about the practice of local administration.
Local government: who does what in England and Wales, 1988.
The functions of local authorities
Local government is both a provider of services to a local authority and an instrument of democratic self-government.
On pp. 154 6 we examine the ‘democratic’ dimension of local government; this section delineates local authority services.
Classification of local government services.
Local authorities can only do what the law explicitly allows; all council powers come from Acts of Parliament.
Indeed, local government itself exists only by courtesy of Parliament and Parliament frequently alters its powers and functions.
Should any local authority provide a service not specifically permitted by Parliament it would be acting illegally, or ultra vires (see Chapter 15).
Nevertheless, despite the advent of ‘contracting out’, local authorities still carry out over fifty functions; indeed, the average British citizen probably has more contact with the state through the services provided by local government than through the outputs of any other level of public administration.
The diversity of services outlined in Figure 8.4 makes any classification somewhat arbitrary.
However, Figure 8.5 offers a useful starting point for discussion.
As this shows, local authorities provide services in five major fields, although with many of them (such as education, housing, social services) other agencies such as government departments,ad hoc authorities and voluntary associations may also play some part in implementation.
Services are not, of course, provided uniformly throughout the country.
Slum clearance, for example, is only a major problem in some areas.
Again, standards of service may vary; beyond the minimum standards which are usually laid down by law there is, in practice, often a wide area of discretion.
Not all functions, moreover, are mandatory upon local authorities; some, like the provision of leisure centres, art galleries and playing fields are permissive (which means the authority has a choice whether or not to provide them).
It is open to any authority, moreover, to promote a private Bill in order to extend its powers.
Although a complex and costly procedure, over the years  many authorities have acquired powers by this means to perform particular functions in their localities: for example, to maintain the external decoration of listed buildings (Kensington and Chelsea), and to operate a municipal bank (Birmingham).
As this latter example suggests, there is also a wide and varied range of trading activities carried out by local authorities (see Chapter 12).
Additionally, since the Local Government Act, 1972 (section 137), local authorities have had general power to spend up to the product of a 2p rate on purposes not specifically authorized by statute.
Consequently, while local authorities in Britain do not have a ‘general competence’ to do whatever they wish in their local areas, the variation in functions and standards between one authority and another may be considerable — to an extent which seemingly belies the simplicity of lists of services such as those contained in Figures 8.4 and 8.5.
For example, there have been a large number of initiatives by local authorities in recent years intended to improve the local economy, many of which have been undertaken under section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972, to incur expenditure which in the authority's opinion is in the interests of their area.
‘Local authorities are playing a part in the promotion of co-operatives, in training schemes, in business advice centres, in the development of new technology and in support for individual firms through rent subsidies, grants and guarantees’(Widdicombe 1986, para. 288).
Neat organization charts simply belie reality.
The Government's White Paper responding to Widdicombe (Department of Environment et al .,
1988) proposes to give councils a new specific power outside S137 (S83 in Scotland) to carry out economic development.
The financial limit for S137/83, currently the product of a 2p rate, will become 5 per head of population for London boroughs and metropolitan districts and 2.50 in areas with two tiers of principal councils.
The powers to vary this by order will remain.
This approximately halves the amount of money available for discretionary spending, even though the White Paper accepts that only twenty-one English councils were spending up to 80 per cent of their S137 limit and two-thirds of S137 spending was an economic development.
Inter-authority relationships
Further complexity in the pattern of service provision stems from the two-tier nature of much of contemporary local government, especially with services (such as planning) where responsibility is shared between districts and counties.
Close liaison between authorities is obviously important in such cases, as well as in those where different authorities provide related services (such as social services and housing).
This  problem is particularly acute in the area of homelessness — a ‘social services’ condition with a housing ‘remedy’(Alexander, 1982b, p. 59).
Of course, co-ordination is invariably more difficult to achieve between organizations than within a single organization.
At reorganization in 1974 the functions of local government were split between four main organizational units — counties, districts, health authorities and water authorities — and relatively sophisticated consultative machinery had to be established in many areas in order to obtain local co-ordinated action.
In practice, however, such arrangements have often tended to cause further confusion (particularly for consumers), as well as to create acrimony between the authorities concerned.
Such acrimony has often been exacerbated, moreover, because of the tendency since the 1974 reorganization for authorities ‘to view the relationship between the tiers as an adversary one’(Alexander, 1982a, p. 65); and also because of the problem of ‘competing mandates’(Alexander, 1982b, p. 54) where authorities at different levels in an area pursuing different policies (and often controlled by different parties) both claim to be acting in the local interest.
One way in which liaison (and confusion) has been institutionalized is by use of agency agreements between authorities.
Section 101 of the Local Government Act, 1972, makes it possible for one authority to appoint another as its agent to carry out its statutory duties — this applies to all functions except education, social services and emergency services.
In practice the major use of such agreements has been in the sphere of highway maintenance and construction, where old county boroughs and large urban districts have  invariably continued to provide the service on behalf of their county council.
They have not infrequently been a source of acrimony between the authorities involved, as well as of wider problems.
As Alexander (1982, p. 30) notes, agency agreements, superimposed ‘on an already complicated allocation’ of local authority functions, have added to the confusion experienced by consumers in service provision and ‘ensured that the processes of public accountability and democratic control would be so convoluted as to raise serious doubts about their effectiveness’.
A further source of friction and confusion is found where authorities have concurrent powers; that is, an equal share in providing services.
The best example is planning, of which the White Paper on Reorganization (Local Government in England , 1971, para. 17) observed: ‘All planning applications should be made to district councils…
Responsibility for broad planning policies and for the development of both structure and local plans must, however, rest with the county councils.
’ In practice these arrangements, like agency agreements, have given rise to confusion and friction, as well as in some cases to delay in determining applications.
Ultimately the position was rationalized by the Local Government, Planning and Land Act, 1980, which restricted  the definition of a ‘county matter’ and specified that all planning applications would be initially handled by district councils.
Liaison between authorities is facilitated by the establishment of forums for different authorities to discuss matters of mutual concern.
Some of these (such as the East Midlands Forum of County Councils) operate on a regional basis, others on a county basis.
Following the 1974 reorganization most counties established county liaison committees representing the county council and all the district councils within it, although these have generally proved ineffective and some have been abandoned.
Inter-district liaison, however, has proved more successful, being facilitated either by specially formed joint consultative committees or through county branches of the Association of District Councils (Alexander, 1982, especially ch. 3).
(The latter association, along with the other two major local authority associations — the Association of Metropolitan Associations and the Association of County Councils — and professional bodies such as SOLACE (Society of Local Authority Chief Executives) also provide opportunities for liaison at national level.)
While forums such as these can take a community-wide approach, they rarely have executive power, being largely bodies for debate and comment.
Councillor bodies are often paralleled at officer level and it is not uncommon to see different outlooks prevail — a further dimension of complexity.
The formal relationships outlined above need to be complemented by an appreciation of informal linkages, such as the sharing of knowledge and experience through the regional branches of professional associations.
Policy networks (such as local government professionals, ‘interested’ councillors, local pressure groups, local/specialist journalists, and so on) are also generally of far more practical importance than is often realized.
Likewise, Rotary, Round Table, and similar organizations can be important integrative tools.
Liaison is often further facilitated by overlapping membership between county and district councils: Widdicombe (1986, vol. 2, Table 4.2) shows that some 13 per cent of all councillors are on two (or more) authorities.
Such structures and networks, however, have generally failed to offset the inherent fragmentation of the post-1986 local government system or the inbuilt suspicions which have accompanied recent reorganizations.
In what is invariably an increasingly highly charged party political arena the goal of co-ordinated local action is often difficult to sustain.
Local politics and democracy
Some observers, like Sharpe (1970), argue that the strongest justification for elected local government is its claim to be an efficient  provider of services.
Because different communities have different needs, the system of government needs to be flexible; local government allegedly provides this by enabling local councillors, drawn from and accountable to the local electorate, to determine local priorities.
While such claims are today being challenged by the proponents of privatization, it is as an efficient provider of services that the claims of local government mainly seem to rest.
Local government, however, is also widely regarded as an instrument of democratic self-government.
The Redcliffe-Maud Commission, for example, was required to have regard to the need ‘to sustain a viable system of local democracy’, the assumption being that it was already democratic.
What, then, are the grounds upon which local government can be said to promote democracy?
THEORIES OF LOCAL DEMOCRACY
Democratic government does not necessarily entail locally elected councils.
Indeed, one strand of continental thinking argues that democracy is essentially concerned with the nation-state and with majority rule, equality and uniformity.
From such a perspective local government is seen as parochial, concerned with inequalities and differences between localities.
This stance, however, contrasts with the traditional British view that local government, enhances democracy, both by providing a vehicle of political education and as a means of increasing the liberty of the citizen by breaking down the power of the centralized state.
This view emphasizes that democracy is not simply concerned with national majority rule, social and political equality, and uniformity of standards but is, rather, an essential means of enabling individuals and local communities to voice their needs.
(For discussion, see Sharpe, 1970; Smith, 1969.)
PARTICIPATION
Participation, it is often held, can be more widely achieved at the local than the national level.
Elected local government enables ‘ordinary’ people to participate in the work of government without the disruption to their careers and domestic life that national office usually involves.
Moving from theory to practice, however, it is clear that public interest in British local government is low, with turnout in local elections much lower than in most European countries.
Only about 40 per cent of the electorate vote in local elections (the turnout in the 1985 English shire county elections, for example, was 41 per cent ) but such a figure can be highly misleading.
Stanyer (1976, pp. 271–2), for example, points out that in 1967 the turnout in Maidstone Rural District was 14.7 per cent while that in Knighton Rural District was 89.6 per cent .
The  dangers of generalizing about ‘apathy’ on the basis of aggregate data can be further highlighted by variation in turnout between different wards in the same authority.
For example, in the 1986 District Council elections turnout in wards in Leicester City ranged from 28 per cent to 61 per cent .
Patterns of participation, even at this minimal level of voting, cannot be divorced from the local social and political environment.
POLITICAL PARTIES
Party politics is now an established part of contemporary local government.
In 1972, before reorganization, only 53 per cent of local authorities were run on party lines.
By 1985 the proportion of councils in party political control had risen to 84 per cent(Widdicombe, 1986, vol. 1, Table 2.1).
The 16 per cent of authorities where Independents are dominant are mostly in the more rural parts of Scotland, England and Wales, but as Widdicombe notes (1986, vol. 1, p. 23)‘the overall figure does perhaps represent a stronger resilience of the Independent tradition in an era of increasing party politicisation than might have been anticipated’.
Partisan local administration has, however, quite clearly arrived in the bulk of British local authorities.
This development is not uncontroversial.
The view is still quite widespread that local government is about local issues and that party politics should not intrude.
However, this view is somewhat idealistic, particularly given the increased size of local authority units following reorganization.
According to Dunsire (1956, p. 87), political parties are the ‘indispensable element in the conversion of local councils into responsible governments’.
Compared with shifting coalitions of Independent councillors, party groupings can make for coherent policy planning and administration.
To some extent, of course, local party politics is simply national party politics writ small-the electorate frequently votes on the basis of non-local factors, something well illustrated in 1982 when the local elections were, as Crewe remarked (The Times , 8 May 1982, p. 2), ‘a referendum’ on the central government's ‘handling of the Falklands crisis’— a far cry from the local population choosing its local decision-makers on the basis of local political issues.
In his study of Wolverhampton, Jones (1969, pp. 348–9) maintained that ‘the parties have enabled individuals to devise a programme of policies and to implement it, and they have presented these programmes to the public in a dramatic and comprehensive way, enabling the public to judge a team of men and measures; thus the accountability of government to the electorate has been strengthened’.
This situation is, of course, only one of an infinite number of models but while it is clearly impossible to generalize about the impact of party  politics, any attempt to understand local public administration without reference to the party-political dimension is doomed to failure.
While public administration in most localities is now firmly entrenched within a party political environment, precise management styles vary considerably.
Two adjacent Labour-controlled authorities for example, may operate quite differently.
Bulpitt (1967) found that in Manchester Labour group discipline was looser than in Salford.
In Rochdale, where the Liberals held the balance of power, there was loose discipline and little formal party organization in the council chamber.
Some contemporary Labour groups have very open decision-making structures; others are dominated by the party leader.
The Conservative party's belief in hierarchy generally gives their leaderships considerable leverage, but again generalization is dangerous.
Research volume 1 of the Widdicombe Report (1986) provides a wealth of information about the extent and nature of party policies in local government.
The government's 1988 White Paper (Department of Environment et al .,
1988) rejected as too extensive Widdicombe's proposal that all principal officers and above be banned from being members of other main councils or being active politically.
The White Paper instead proposed that prohibition would apply to chief executives, chief officers, deputies and others who regularly advise or act on behalf of their councils — a concerted attempt to reduce the impact of ‘twin tracking’ in local politics.
PRESSURE GROUPS
Pressure group activity at the local level is considerable.
Partly because of the diverse interests within local communities but also because of the ineffectiveness in many areas of more institutionalized channels bureaucratic officials, unresponsive councillors, decaying parties, and so on— their role in local politics has tended to increase.
In Birmingham, Newton (1976, chs 3 and 4) identified over 4,000 organized groups and estimated that there were probably about twice that number in total.
Other studies have shown similarly extensive local group activity but in Birmingham, only about one-third were  politically active and most of these (63 per cent) were involved only with a single issue.
Many groups have very specific and limited demands (such as over local amenities) and when the particular issue has been resolved they disband.
Dearlove's study (1973, ch. 8) of Kensington and Chelsea showed that the council's response to groups revolved largely around councillor assessment of them.
Some groups were not favourably received partly because they had little to offer the council but also because they were seen as making ‘unreasonable’ demands on the local authority — that is, demands which did not square with the councillors' own policy predispositions.
Other groups (such as the WRVS and housing associations) were seen as ‘helpful’, since they had something to contribute (cheap welfare provision or extra housing).
Likewise, Newton's ‘established’ groups built up a ‘close set’of relationships with public officials in Birmingham (1976, p. 85), while his poorly established groups found it difficult to gain access to decision-makers and thereby had to resort to demonstrations, petitions and so on which only served to make them even more unacceptable.
The local pressure group world does not provide equal access to all.
Ethnic minority groupings, squatters and welfare rights workers, for example, usually fare badly in comparison with status quo middle-class groups.
Again, though, generalization is dangerous since some ‘radical’ socialist councils may respond favourably to groups challenging traditional norms (see Stoker, 1988).
Equally, of course, as Dearlove (1979, p. 49) emphasizes, the inactivity of a particular section of the local population (such as the National Union of Mineworkers in some mining areas)‘may occur precisely because that interest is built into the very heart of the council itself’.
While pressure-group influence varies over time and from issue to issue, such groupings must now be seen as an integral part of local public administration.
NON-LOCAL INFLUENCES
Dunleavy argues that too frequently local policy-making is explained purely in terms of factors internal to specific localities.
He maintains (1980a, p. 163) that far greater attention should be paid to non-local influences, asserting that ‘local political studies have fundamentally failed to explain the observed regularity of urban policy change across many decentralized authorities’.
In the educational sphere, for example, he points to the uniformity of local education authorities in adopting a tripartite system of secondary education following the 1944 Education Act.
Then, from the late 1960s, most LEAs reorganized on comprehensive lines.
In this and other cited areas (such as the development of high-rise flats and the commercial redevelopment of numerous town centres since the 1950s), central government did more than simply exhort — it provided financial incentives to help secure compliance.
Local authorities do not generally make policy decisions in isolation.
‘In particular, over and above their local roles, councils are located and locate themselves in what may be termed the ‘national local government system’ ' (Dunleavy, 1980a, p. 105).
Local authority associations, national party organizations, public service trade unions, professional bodies and the innumerable journals, conferences and publications help the nationalizing of innovations in local services.
Local public administration clearly needs to be seen in the context of the broader political, social and economic system.
Two points about Dunleavy's framework can usefully be raised:(a) He tends to assume that what applies in the case of high-rise flats or town-centre redevelopment applies in other areas of policy-making;(b) He places a heavy emphasis on the nationalizing of urban policy change, arguing (1980a, p. 98) that within ‘broad limits the decentralised authorities implementing policies have moved in step with a precision that cries out for explanation’.
Surely this is an exaggeration.
It is possible to provide examples of policy patterns (such as provision for the disabled) varying considerably across the country.
Further, the cited examples from education and planning stretch Dunleavy's ‘broad limits’ to breaking point.
Although nationwide policy changes are observable, this should not obscure the fact that there remains considerable variety in the policy and practice of local authorities.
Financing local government
Local government finance is important both economically and politically:economically because about one quarter of all public expenditure is spent by local authorities;politically because the finance available to local government largely determines the level of services which it can provide.
Whilst it is theoretically true at the time of writing that local authorities, through the rates, currently have a source of finance independent of central government, finance which can be spent on any object within their statutory jurisdiction, this is not the whole story.
In reality the picture is far more complex than that.
Understanding local government finance is not easy (see Greenwood, 1988b).
As a starting point, however, it is helpful to make a distinction (although the two do interconnect) between current (or revenue ) finance and capital finance.
CURRENT (OR REVENUE) FINANCE
In 1984/5 local authorities in England incurred a total of 39.6bn revenue account expenditure.
Such expenditure is used to pay for items of a relatively short-term nature (such as wages and postage).
The income to finance that expenditure (41.8bn in 1984/5) was raised from three main sources: 1) rates, 11.3bn (27 per cent); 2) government grants, 16.4bn (39.2 per cent ); 3) charges and miscellaneous 14.1bn (33.8 per cent )(all figures from Travers, 1986.
Tables App. 2, 3 and 7).
While the proportion received from the various sources will obviously vary from authority to authority, virtually all will receive some revenue from all three.
(I) Rates
Local rates have long been a controversial source of local authority income.
They are a form of taxation levied on local property, and are calculated on the basis of the rent at which the property might reasonably be let.
Each year the rating authority fixes a rate in the pound and the occupier is obliged to pay rates at that poundage.
For example, if a property has a rateable value of 100 and the local authority sets its rate at 54.5p the full rates payable would be 54.50p per annum .
The crucial elements, therefore, are rateable value and rate poundage.
Each year local authorities produce estimates of likely expenditure for the coming year.
From this figure they deduct their estimated income from charges and central government grants together with any cash balances available for the purpose.
This leaves a balance which then has to be financed through locally levied rates.
In 1966 rate rebates were introduced for those householders unable to pay the full amount and by 1977/8 rebates went to 15 per cent of all households in England and Wales.
In addition some properties (such as government buildings, agricultural land and buildings, churches) are exempt from rates.
What are the major objections to the rates?
(i)
They are said to be ‘regressive’: they bear most heavily on those with low incomes since the key element is the value of the property not the occupier's ability to pay.
The availability of rebates has, however, gone a long way to meeting this objection.
(ii)
They are said to be unfair.
Rate resources are unevenly distributed among local authorities and are not necessarily related to their different needs.
Government grants, however, can be used to smooth out this unevenness.
(iii)
Their basis (annual rental value) is not adequate.
Calculating a notional rental value is fraught with difficulties; hence, the frequently canvassed alternative of capital values for domestic property rating, or site values, as a basis for payment.
(iv)
Local accountability is undermined as (a) more than half of rate income comes from the non-voting business sector and (b) some electors (such as lodgers, young adults living with parents) do not pay rates.
Of 35m local electors in England and Wales, only 18m are directly liable to pay rates, and rate rebates reduce the number paying the full rates to 12m.
Thus many electors can vote for extra spending knowing the cost will fall elsewhere.
Against these objections must be set the advantages of the rating system: payment is difficult to avoid, income is predictable, and collection is cheap and easy.
Reform of the rating system has long been on the political agenda.
In  1976 the Layfield Report,Local Government Finance , suggested that a local income tax should supplement the rates, although it listed many difficulties associated with such a venture.
However, a government Green Paper,Local Government Finance (1977), issued in response, rejected this suggestion.
In 1981 the Thatcher government issued a further Green Paper,Alternatives to Domestic Rates .
This did not advocate a particular option but commented on specific alternatives (for example, local sales tax, local income tax, poll tax, an assigned share of national taxes) while ruling out others (for example , local duties on petrol, alcohol or tobacco, local vehicle excise duty; charges for licences for sale of alcohol or petrol; and a local payroll tax).
Two years later, however, in a further White Paper,Rates: Proposals for Rate Limitation and Reform of the Rating System (1983), the government recognized that wide consultation had failed to find any consensus for an alternative local tax, and conceded that rates should remain for the foreseeable future as the main source of local government revenue.
However, the issue was not settled and following a rating revaluation in Scotland, which caused much unrest, a further inquiry (the fourth in fifteen years) began, which resulted in the 1986 Green Paper, Paying for Local Government .
This heralded the possibility of major changes, notably:
(i)
A uniform business rate set by government with the proceeds distributed to all local authorities in proportion to the number of adults in their areas;
(ii)
a much simplified grant system;
(iii)
the replacement of domestic rates by a community charge which each authority would set and which would be paid by every adult (not just householders) resident in its area.
(Subsequently, the government proposed exempting the mentally ill and elderly people living in homes and hospitals; and also allowing a discount for students and the less well off; see Paying for Local Government-the Community Charge , 1986.)
These new arrangements will be introduced in one stage in Scotland and Wales, in 1989 and 1990 respectively.
In England there was to have been a four-year transitional period, commencing in 1990, during which the community charge would have been gradually introduced and rates phased out, but the Secretary of State, in response to pressure from his own party, agreed late in 1987 that with the exception of a handful of London boroughs (where some flexibility remains) the community charge should be introduced throughout England in 1990 without any phasing-in period.
These proposals were enshrined in the 1988 Local Government Finance Act.
These changes put forward by the government are extremely  controversial.
In their favour it can be stated that the consultation process which followed the publication of Paying for Local Government showed twice as many people wanting to abolish the rates as wishing to keep them.
The community charge, which received most support as a replacement, would arguably be more fair and enhance local accountability by ensuring that all local electors contributed towards the cost of local services.
However, critics point to the regressive nature of the community charge — apart from specified categories who will receive exemption or discounts (for example, students) everyone in an area will pay the same regardless of income — and the difficulties and expense of administration and collection.
The retention of the business rate, moreover, will perpetuate many of the inherent problems of the rating system, and — in so far as this will be set by Whitehall — will increase the potential for central control of local finances.
In Wilson's view (1986, p. 64) what is proposed does not form the basis ‘for a generally acceptable…durable system’ and ‘there seems no escape from the conclusion that another attempt will have to be made to review these issues and make fresh recommendations’.
If this view is correct the debate about reforming the rating system may continue well beyond the enactment of the Local Government Finance Act, 1988.
(2) Grants
Grants can be paid to support both capital and revenue expenditure, although today capital grants are relatively unimportant.
About a quarter of exchequer support is paid over in the form of specific or supplementary grants .
These are tied to particular services and in most cases reimburse individual authorities for a fixed percentage of their expenditure on the service concerned.
Most important, however, is the rate support grant, which accounts for around 75 per cent of the total grant paid to local authorities and is paid over to individual authorities as a block sum.
It consists of two elements:(i)domestic rate relief , paid to enable authorities to relieve domestic ratepayers of a certain proportion of their rates (currently 18.5p in the);(ii)block grant, intended to supplement an authority's own finances so that, irrespective of individual local needs and resources, it can provide a similar standard of service for a similar rate poundage to other authorities of the same class.
It can be spent on any service(s), as an authority wishes.
Each year following discussions in the Consultative Council on Local Government Finance, central government calculates a) the total amount of revenue spending it will accept for grant purposes (relevant expenditure); and b) the percentage of relevant expenditure to be financed by grant.
After climbing steadily over the years, the percentage supported by government reached a peak in England and Wales of 66.5 per cent in 1975/6.
Subsequently, however, it was reduced as part of central government public expenditure restraint policies and by   
National Rate Support Grant Settlement 1987/8
1987/8 had fallen to 47.5 per cent(46.3 per cent for England; and 66.7 per cent for Wales).
Following these calculations the government deducts the value of specific and supplementary grants (including domestic rate relief grant) and distributes the remainder as block grant (see Table 8.1).
In practice, as ‘over-spending’ authorities lose grant (see pp. 199–200), the amount distributed is less than this.
From 1987/8 this money returns to the Treasury (formerly it went into a national pool for recycling to authorities).
Government grants to local authorities have now been paid for well over a century.
The justification for them is well established: many local government services are required by national legislation, local variations in needs and resources can be equalized by grant adjustments, the impact of the regressive rating system can be reduced, and so on.
Politically, however, their main effect during the twentieth century has been to make local government financially dependent upon the centre.
From the Second World War the percentage of local government income derived from grants increased steadily and although the proportion began to fall during the 1980s (as a result of public expenditure restraint policies) it is still sufficient to provide central government with a powerful instrument for influencing local authorities.
In recent years, moreover, a growing proportion of total grant has been contributed by specific grants (17.6 per cent in England, 1981 /2; 25.6 per cent in 1987/8), which — being tied, unlike block grant, to specific services — leave authorities with less discretion to determine spending priorities.
(3) Charges
Income from charges is derived from fees, rents, tolls, fares, interest, etc.
Obviously, the amounts received by individual authorities vary widely, according to the type and range of chargeable services provided, and the levels at which charges are set.
The latter is in some cases  subject to statutory regulation, in others it is a matter of local discretion.
CAPITAL FINANCE
Capital account expenditure by local authorities (6.9bn in England 1984/5) is usually spent on longer-term items such as the purchase, construction or improvement of land, property, equipment and so forth.
The capital income used to finance that income (7.0bn in 1984/5) can be raised from several sources including 1)capital grants from the government or, occasionally, other bodies (such as the Sports Council); 2)sales of land, property, equipment and so on; and 3)loans .
Both because of the long-term nature of the investments and the large sums involved, most capital expenditure has traditionally been financed through borrowing.
There are, however, central government controls on what councils may borrow, and loan sanctions must usually be obtained from ministers.
Because of tightening central government controls on borrowing, the proportion of local authority capital income derived from borrowing fell sharply during the 1970s and 1980s (from 83.7 per cent in 1974/5 to 48.4 per cent in 1984/5)(all figures for England are calculated from Travers, 1986, tables, App. 4 and 5).
In order to compensate, local authorities increasingly financed capital (expenditure) out of current revenues (rates and charges) and — particularly after 1980 with the Thatcher government's emphasis on council housing and land sales — with capital receipts from disposal of assets.
While revenue contributions inevitably increased burdens upon ratepayers, and asset sales produced a ‘once only’ financial benefit (as well as being politically unpalatable to many, notably Labour-controlled, authorities) this was the perhaps inevitable response of local authorities seeking to free themselves from centrally-imposed borrowing restrictions (as well as the high cost of borrowing after the mid-1970s).
Even so, total local authority borrowing is enormous.
In 1985 local authorities (England and Wales) had a gross loan debt outstanding of 42.3bn and total loan charges for the year serviced from revenue account amounted to 5.03bn (far more than revenue expenditure on major services such as police (3.3bn) and social services (2.98bn).
(Annual Abstract of Statistics , 1987 edn, CSO, tables 16.13, 16.15.)
The level of loan charges, moreover, is largely beyond local government's control, varying according to interest rates.
As debt must be serviced to avoid defaulting on creditors, planned ‘cuts’ in local expenditure particularly in periods of rising interest rates — invariably have to fall on other revenue items, such as salaries, running costs and services.
By the early 1980s the combined effect of several years of high interest rates, tight centrally-imposed borrowing limits and progressive sharp falls in  the level of revenue expenditure borne by block grant, were placing increasingly onerous burdens on ratepayers.
In some areas rate levels were already beyond the limits which were regarded as socially and politically acceptable.
It is in this context that the debate about rating reform, and the controversy surrounding increased central control of local expenditure, should be seen.
9 INSIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
The apparently straightforward pattern depicted on formal committee and management charts massively oversimplifies the internal working of local authorities.
At a basic level informal as well as formal relationships must be considered, as must political as well as administrative dimensions.
Widdicombe (1986, vol. 1, table 2.1) revealed that in 1985 the proportion of councils in party political control had risen to 84 per cent, hence in ‘many, perhaps most…councils the party group’ which rarely figures on organization charts —‘has become the focus of political decision’(Alexander, 1982a, p. 97).
This chapter looks inside local government at internal authority organization, at officer councillor relationships and at the distribution of power inside the town hall.
Formal structures
While the administrative style of local authorities varies enormously all conduct their work through: a) meetings of the council, consisting of all elected members; and b) committees and sub-committees consisting of small groups of members whose numbers and designations differ from authority to authority.
(Some committees also include non-councillors; notably police committees, one-third of whose members are drawn from non-elected local magistrates.)
Some committees focus on single services (such as housing or education) and are frequently called vertical committees; others, usually known as horizontal committees, deal with a single aspect of all services (such as personnel, finance).
The trend in recent years has been towards establishing more horizontal committees in the interests of greater internal co-ordination.
Even so, the committee system — where political control of policy and administration for each service is vested collectively in a group of councillors — offers a sharp contrast with the ministerial system in central administration.
As Alexander (1982a, p. 121) puts it, ‘the committee system of decision-making which predominates in British local government makes no provision for a political executive, either individual or collective’.
The committee system generally ensures detailed coverage of council business.
Different items can be dealt with concurrently in different committees and the relative informality of proceedings  encourages frank discussion by councillors and officers alike.
Indeed, by enabling them to work together in committee — often over many years — the system facilitates contact between officers and councillors.
Likewise, because committees usually contain members of different parties with different degrees of seniority and influence, contact is also facilitated between councillors of different political standing and party affiliation.
One danger, however, is that committee loyalties might become too strong, causing members to become isolationist or even antagonistic to other service areas, thereby making an integrated authority-wide approach more difficult to obtain.
Just as committee systems vary between authorities, so too do departmental patterns.
As in central government, the functional principle of allocation (see Chapter 2) is widely used, with departments having responsibility for particular services (education, housing, social services, and so forth); however, in local government allocation by process is also quite widespread, with departments of engineers or architects, for example , providing specialist services throughout their authority.
Although invariably fewer, smaller, and less multifunctional than central governmental departments, the differences are relative and problems of co-ordination both within and between departments are nevertheless frequently found within local authorities.
While formal management and committee structures require study, informal relationships are also crucially important.
At the local level, where departments are often housed in the same buildings, and where officers and councillors — as well as prominent local interest group officials, journalists, council ‘clients’(headmasters, businessmen, builders, and so on)— live in the same locality, the informal dimension is especially important and should not be obscured by undue emphasis on formal hierarchies.
Corporate planning
The fragmentation of council functions between different departments and committees produced in many authorities prior to the 1970s ‘a loose confederation of disparate activities’ which, in the view of the Maud Committee on the Management of Local Government (Maud Report, 1967, vol. 1), dispersed ‘responsibilities and scatter[ed] the taking of decisions’.
In some of the larger authorities, the committee found (vol. 5) that there were thirty or more committees and forty or more sub-committees, while in local government generally ‘there [was]hardly any systematic attempt at committee level to…coordinate policy as a whole’.
Sometimes finance committees exerted some degree of co-ordination but they were usually ill-equipped for the task, being primarily concerned with financial implications.
Consequently,
Maud recommended each authority to establish ‘a management board’ of between five and nine members to co-ordinate council work.
Committees would only be deliberative , making recommendations to the management board, which would perform functions similar to those of the Cabinet in central government.
The Maud Report provoked considerable hostility, particularly on the grounds of dividing councillors into first-class members (sitting on the management board) and second-class (backbench) members.
Not a single authority implemented Maud's ‘Cabinet style’ solution in its entirety; nevertheless, many streamlined their committee structures and some even established policy co-ordinating committees.
More generally, Maud generated a climate for greater integration, something which became particularly appropriate during the preparations for reorganization when two major committees (Bains for England and Wales, and Paterson for Scotland) were established to advise on management structures for the new local authorities.
The Bains Report (1972) and its Scottish equivalent, the Paterson Report (1973), both recommended a corporate approach to internal council management and policy-making.
At councillor level a Policy and Resources Committee was proposed to prioritize resources, coordinate policy, and control programme implementation throughout the authority.
To assist with these tasks each policy and resources committee was recommended to have four sub-committees: finance, land, personnel, and performance review.
At officer level there was to be a chief executive (in place of the former town clerk) whose role was to advise the Policy and Resources Committee and head a small management team (consisting mainly of chief departmental officers) which would prepare plans and programmes as well as co-ordinate policy implementation.
Bains also favoured committees based on broad programme areas and ‘serviced by several different departments and disciplines’ in place of the ‘traditional separatist structures’(Haynes, 1980, p. 54) whereby each service committee had tended to be associated with the appropriate functional department and its principal officer.
In the post-Bains era corporate structures have been widely adopted.
According to Greenwood et al .
(1980, p. 50), 95 per cent of authorities established policy committees and 98 per cent appointed chief executives and management teams.
Nevertheless, whether corporate planning has become a reality is a separate issue.
Powerful programme committees, and influential members serving on them, have sometimes been reluctant to defer to policy committees (particularly as many councillors still cling to the traditional view that co-ordination is the role of the full council).
Similarly, there has often been a reluctance by specialist departmental officers to accept the decisions of non-specialist chief executives and  management teams.
Consequently it has sometimes been difficult for the new patterns to establish themselves in the face of combined resistance from programme committees, established departments, and professional senior officers.
It also needs to be recognized that in some authorities — particularly small district councils where there are fewer personnel, resources and programmes — much co-ordinating work occurs informally and the elaborate corporate structures advocated by Bains are perhaps less appropriate.
Managerialist attitudes have also had an impact, with a few authorities (particularly on the radical right) preferring a managing director model, which downgrades corporate management and has sometimes undermined Bains-type arrangements even where they formally continue in existence.
Changes in attitude conducive to the development of a corporate approach would have been difficult to effect at any time.
During the post-reorganization climate of economic and financial stringency, however, where departmental and committee defences rise easily, it has been especially difficult.
Consequently, while corporate structures have developed apace since reorganization, it is questionable whether the corporate ethos has become deeply rooted.
Indeed, a few authorities have retreated from corporate structures-management teams have been disbanded and some chief executives dismissed.
The reason normally given is economy but the real cause is frequently a reassertion of anti-corporate attitudes.
The Widdicombe Report (1986, pp. 142–5), arguing from the standpoint that the ‘need for a more corporate approach to the officer structure had strengthened rather than weakened’ since Bains, recommended that all local authorities should be statutorily required to appoint a Chief Executive with considerably enhanced powers.
Other factors, of course, contribute to the difficulty of effecting a corporate approach.
Statutory obligations inhibit what is structurally possible; for example, non-metropolitan county councils must have education and social services committees.
There is also a fragmentary approach by central government to local authorities.
As the Central Policy Review Staff (1977, p. 22) noted, most circulars ‘relate to a single service and are drafted and circulated by the single department responsible’.
Corporate planning must also be seen in the context of party politics.
While decisions in a formal sense are taken corporately by, or on behalf of, the full council, in many authorities decisions are taken in practice on party lines.
Indeed, in its White Paper response to the Widdicombe Report (Department of Environment et al .,
1988) the government agreed in principle that officers' terms of service should be altered to allow them to attend party group meetings, subject to procedural safeguards.
This largely reflected the fact that in a significant minority of authorities — about 11 per cent— one-party policy and resources (or similar) committees are found, whilst in 64 per cent an informal ‘inner circle’ of the majority leadership meets regularly, usually in the presence of officers (Widdicombe, 1986, paras 5.56; 5.57).
Such arrangements perhaps offer the closest local government parallel to the Cabinet system enabling majority party leaders to formulate policy with the advice of officers.
Formally, however, most policy and resources committees are politically representative which coupled with access by press and public — often prevents frank discussion by controlling group members of planning, prioritization, and co-ordination in politically sensitive fields.
As a result, policy and resources committee proceedings have in many authorities become either duplicates of, or substitutes for, the work of the full council and the function of policy co-ordination has shifted to the party political groups, or to the chief executive and management team, or…both' (Alexander, 1982a, p. 91).
The 1988 White Paper Department of Environment et al .,
1988) also asserts that membership of decision-taking committees should reflect proportionately the political composition of the full council.
This provision will be implemented by law, not standing orders, and will effectively see the end of one-party committees in the vast majority of local authorities.
The government also agrees that there should be a ban on co-option with voting rights to decision-taking committees, but this will not apply to magistrates appointed to police committees, church representatives on education committees, or local committees managing specific council facilities.
Councils will be allowed to appoint non-voting advisers to committees who must have relevant expertise or experience and not be disqualified from council membership — except in the case of teachers on education or library committees.
It should be stressed that a local authority's corporate planning is only one variable in securing efficient management within a local community.
There are a range of bodies other than local councils responsible for the provision of local services which, coupled with the tiered nature of much of elected local government, makes a community-wide approach to management almost impossible.
Developing inter-governmental as well as inter-authority networks is crucial if real co-ordination of local services is to be effected.
While an authority's management style is usually affected by environmental factors there always remains an element of choice.
There can never be a purely mechanistic relationship between an organization and its environment.
Party political factors, professionalism and the dispositions of key personalities all usually have some bearing on internal management structures.
The advocates of ‘rational administration’ remain just one voice amongst many.
Councillors
SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS
While councillors are representative of their local communities they are certainly not socially representative of the population.
Widdicombe (1986, vol. 2), found 81 per cent of councillors were male and only 19 per cent female; the report showed that 59 per cent of councillors came from three socio-economic groups (professional, employers and managers, intermediate non-manual) who contribute 23 per cent of the population.
Some 22 per cent of councillors had a degree or equivalent qualification compared to only 5 per cent of the general population.
The majority of councillors were aged 45 or over with none under 24, the oldest being 85.
As these figures suggest, councillors are predominantly male, middle-aged, and middle-class to a far greater extent than the population as a whole.
To a large extent this social unrepresentativeness reflects some of the structural inequalities of contemporary society.
For example, the constraints of women's lifestyles and their domestic and family responsibilities often mean that they are effectively discriminated against in terms of availability for election and service.
Similarly, the pattern of afternoon meetings, still found in many authorities, discourages certain sections of the community, including all those with ‘normal’ working hours and, again, women with family responsibilities, from offering themselves as candidates.
Council work is currently essentially unpaid and the heavy workload involved makes service less attractive for people with young families, who are also building careers.
Widdicombe found that councillors spent,on average , seventy-four hours per month on council duties.
Party leaders and committee chairmen spent a good deal more.
The middle-class skills — such as public speaking — required to be an effective councillor may also discourage many manual workers.
It must nevertheless be stressed that the figure above is an average; individual localities often have distinctive patterns, and many Labour dominated authorities do have a high proportion of working-class councillors.
Do the trends revealed above have any significance for the outputs and conduct of local government?
In one sense it can be argued that generalizations are of little use.
Councillors are not a homogeneous, undifferentiated grouping; their interests, outlooks and backgrounds vary enormously.
There are disagreements between councillors of the same party just as there are disagreements between those of opposing parties.
Such disagreements may stem from a variety of causes: ideological perspectives, ward and area considerations, seniority (old v. young), status (chairmen/spokesmen v. backbenchers), committee  and pressure-group loyalties, or simply politicking or ‘bloody mindedness’.
As Newton (1979, p. 112) observes, there are also varying ability levels.
While some of the ‘ordinary members’ may accurately be depicted as ignorant and unintelligent, ‘council leaders are more usually of a much higher calibre’.
Increasingly, moreover, in the larger authorities council leaders and key committee chairmen effectively work full time — a development given some impetus by the introduction of Special Responsibility Allowances (SRAs) for senior councillors in 1980 (Skelcher, 1983; Widdicombe 1986, vol. 2).
Compositional trends, however, should not be dismissed too easily.
As Byrne (1986, p. 127) asks, ‘does the lack of women councillors explain the apparent inadequacy of nursery provision, while there is an arguably ample supply of municipal golfing facilities?’
Social elitism, it is frequently asserted, effectively squeezes out working-class interests.
Indeed Dearlove (1979, p. 245) maintains that part of the case for reorganizing local government in 1972 and creating larger units was ‘to make local government more functional for dominant interests’(that is, less accessible to working-class representation).
Social elitism, however, needs to be distinguished from political elitism: Labour and Conservative councillors on a local authority could easily have relatively similar (and relatively elitist) social backgrounds but very different political priorities.
The political/ideological dimension is perhaps a more crucial factor than social background in determining policy priorities, although the two can never be entirely disentangled.
Perhaps, ultimately, the issue is this: there is nothing amiss with manual workers (or any other grouping) being councillors, provided they can control their officers.
If they cannot, councillors develop policy only in so far as the bureaucracy permits.
Training for new councillors might, in this context, be a useful resource but, as Greenwood and Wilson (1987a and 1987b) show, most training is lamentably inadequate, not least because chief officers and senior councillors are often unenthusiastic about new councillors being too well briefed.
Payment for councillors might also persuade more working-class representatives to come forward.
Indeed, the attendance allowance system has made it possible for councillors from a broader social range to serve on local authorities but this is far removed from receiving a salary.
REPRESENTATIONAL ROLES
The literature often focuses excessively upon officer-councillor relationships, thereby overlooking the very different roles which councillors themselves adopt.
As Jennings (1982, p. 67) has observed, most councillors are backbenchers, not policy-makers, and about the only vital service they see themselves doing is casework for their  constituents.
This generalization, however, needs refining.
Jones (1973, pp. 135–46) provides a useful quantification of roles, arguing that three broad categories are identifiable:(i) 75 per cent are mainly concerned with representing ward and constituents' interests;(ii) 5 per cent serve as general policymakers;(iii) 20 per cent serve as policymakers in specific service areas.
Newton (1976, ch. 6) offers an even more detailed classification of councillors, based on his study of Birmingham:
(i)
parochials — whose world is largely bounded by the ward, individual constituents and their problems (15 per cent of sample were in this group);
(ii)
people's agents — similar to the above, but for this group ideology is more important.
They see themselves as protecting citizens' interests rather than as delegates (18 per cent);
(iii)
policy advocates — a preference for policy matters on a city-wide not a ward perspective.
Strong ideological orientations (24 per cent)
(iv)
policy brokers — similar to policy advocates but essentially moderates, compromisers and bargainers (20 per cent)
(v)
policy spokesmen — concerned with broad policy matters but also seeing themselves as delegates.
By speaking on behalf of their constituents they occasionally thereby disagree with aspects of party policy (8 per cent).
Such classifications inevitably simplify reality, but it is clear that different members may hold very different views about the role of local councillors.
PARTY GROUPS
The Widdicombe Report (1986, para. 6.57) showed that 85 per cent of councillors are elected in the name of a political party.
In some authorities this party dominance has been reflected in formal structures by the formulation of one-party committees or sub-committees, although this remains the exception rather than the rule (Widdicombe, 1986, vol. 1, p. 34).
More usually formal committees have remained politically representative, with the main focus of organized party activity being reflected in party groups.
Groups are now an integral part of most local authorities although operational styles vary enormously.
Overall, 4 per cent of groups meet weekly, 38 per cent every two to four weeks, and 58 per cent less often.
Labour groups meet significantly more frequently than Conservative groups (Widdicombe, 1986, para. 6.59).
In authorities where there are party groups it is  almost universal practice for the group to meet before meetings of full council and for group decisions to be binding on members at full council meetings, although there is often (but not always) a more relaxed attitude to voting discipline in committees (see Widdicombe, 1986, vol. 1, tables 2.3–2.6).
Although party politics, particularly in urban areas, has long been a feature of local government, its extension after 1974 — mainly a product of the larger authority areas created by reorganization — has helped to transform the operating style of many authorities.
Today many decisions are taken in private party meetings, only very occasionally with officers in attendance and then normally only for specific items.
Even so it is possible to exaggerate the  contribution of party groups to the policy-making process.
Alexander (1982a, p. 198), for example, argues that this ‘is more often than not reactive rather than initiative.
Except where the controlling group comes to power with a programme worked out in detail, the relationship between professional expertise and political organisation will ensure that much of the business of the authority will be generated by officers’.
In conformity with this view Green (1981, p. 62) saw Newcastle's ruling Labour group as ‘a receiving shop, serving to legitimate decisions taken elsewhere’.
Neither Jones (1969) in his study of Wolverhampton, nor Bulpitt (1967) in his analysis of a number of north-west Labour parties, could find evidence of party groups undertaking a successful policy formulation role.
On the other hand Wiseman (1963) found a highly influential Labour group in Leeds City Council.
It is clearly a mistake to generalize from a few examples.
Every party group is unique, not only in terms of composition but also in its conventions and working practices.
For example, while most meet in the absence of officers, Widdicombe (1986, paras 6.173–77) found that the chief executive ‘always’ attended in I per cent of authorities and was present occasionally in 27 per cent .
Again, in 72 per cent of cases non-councillors attend group meetings and in 11 per cent these may include council employees who are also party members.
The Government's 1988 White Paper (Department of Environment et al .,
1988) backed Widdicombe's call that national political parties should ensure that only councillors vote at party group meetings and a public list of all attending is made available.
In some groups backbenchers may be largely unimportant; in others they may be able to play a decisive role in promoting policy initiatives.
Davies (1979 and 1981), in a study of Wandsworth, describes how a small number of newly elected backbench councillors in the controlling Labour group crucially developed a whole range of new planning and industrial policies.
They persuaded party leaders and the party group to adopt the initiative and subsequently took an important role in the process of implementation.
Clearly group decisions can be  decisive in some authorities and on some issues.
As Stoker and Wilson note (1986, p. 292) while ‘over many issues and for much of the time the group may simply endorse decisions taken elsewhere, at the very least senior councillors and officers must be careful not to offend the core political values and commitments of backbenchers’.
Officers
Unlike civil servants, local authority employees are not part of a single unified service: each council employs its own staff.
Altogether, in 1987 some 2.35m people were employed by English, Welsh and Scottish local authorities, engaged in a range of occupations from architects, engineers and accountants to labourers, dustmen and park attendants.
Although local authorities have considerable discretion in staffing matters, some officers must statutorily be appointed.
For example, non-metropolitan counties and metropolitan districts are required to appoint chief education officers and directors of social services.
Traditionally, local authority employees are categorized into officers (20 per cent of all employees: professional, technical and clerical staff) and servants (50 per cent, incorporating manual workers such as cleaners and road labourers).
Additionally, some 30 per cent of local authority employees (teachers, firemen and police) form a third category.
It is, however, the first category, officers, who form what is known as the local government service: it is these who have most contact with councillors and who perform primary policy advisory and managerial roles.
As with civil servants, officers in local government have both a managerial role — being responsible for the efficient running of their department- and a policy-advisory function.
However, unlike their counterparts in central government, where top civil servants are usually generalists, chief officers in local government are normally specialists.
Generally at the head of each department is a chief officer with appropriate technical qualifications who advises councillors and implements policy in fields relating to his specialism.
In local government it is extremely difficult for a non-specialist to reach chief officer status.
As Poole (1978, p. 43) observes, the local government administrator typically works ‘as a subordinate of the specialist, relieving him of those tasks which have not called for specialist experience and qualifications’.
In one other respect, too, local government officers offer a contrast with central government.
While they are politically neutral they are not anonymous; they may speak in public at committee and other meetings, and often acquire public prominence within their locality.
The distinctiveness of localities and the relative freedom which  authorities now enjoy in staffing means that generalizations are dangerous.
Nevertheless, specialist officers invariably have loyalties to their profession as well as to their employing authority and this further weakens the concept of a unified service.
It can also lead to narrowness in that staff may have technical and specialist information in a single field but little concern or understanding about the work of other departments.
Narrowness not only increases co-ordination difficulties between departments but is not conducive to corporate planning.
Specialists, moreover, often build their careers by moving from one authority to another rather than by climbing within one authority.
This, at times, can cause instability within an authority, although, equally, mobility can bring new ideas.
The mobility of specialists, moreover, needs to be seen against the ‘localist’ orientations of councillors and administrators.
Since Bains an increasing amount of chief officers' time has been devoted to liaison with other departmental heads to formulate corporate strategies.
In this context working relationships are extremely important.
Whatever management structures are created in the interest of co-ordination, ‘personality’ remains an important variable.
While academic literature is full of material on officer-councillor relationships, relatively little is known about relationships between departmental chiefs within the same authority, but these, obviously, can be of crucial significance.
Chief officers also liaise with other administrative units operating in the locality (such as the field offices of central government departments along with health and water authorities) and there are also important linkages with other councils, members of the public, and local pressure groups (such as ratepayers' action groups, local trade union branches, tenants' associations).
The work of a senior local government officer is, therefore, far broader than the confines of a single department or even a single local authority.
The government's 1988 White Paper in response to Widdicombe rejected Widdicombe's central recommendation of a powerful chief executive with statutory powers and protection to ensure the council's legal probity and managerial effectiveness.
Instead the government called for each council to appoint an officer responsible for reviewing the propriety and legality of council business who would be under statutory duty to report if an action or decision was likely to be improper or unlawful.
It also called for an officer to be designated as responsible for advising on management of council services (Department of Environment,et al .,
1988).
It appears that the Widdicombe recommendation to give statutory powers to chief executives was rejected because most chief executives did not want them and politicians were cautious of such powers in the hands of one officer (see Local Government Chronicle , 29July 1988, pp. 8, 9).
Officer-councillor relationships
VARYING PERSPECTIVES
One particularly crucial relationship at local authority level is that between officers and councillors, but there is no uniform pattern.
Relationships vary between as well as within local authorities.
There are also varying relationships between different policy fields.
Chief Constables, for example, are n a different position from other chief officers by holding executive authority in their own right (and not derived from councillors), an arrangement which lies at the heart of suggestions that the police are less accountable for their actions than other local-authority employees (Oliver, 1987).
Relationships in a single policy area also vary over time according to the issues and personalities involved.
One must, therefore, beware of generalizations.
As Newton (1976, p. 147) notes, the literature ‘includes case studies of powerful officers, and powerless ones, as well as the conclusion that it all depends on the department’.
Two distinctive themes have, however, been dominant in recent years:(i) the ‘formal’ stance, that councillors make policy and officers simply implement it;(ii) the ‘dictatorship of the official’thesis which holds that officials, with their technical expertise, are dominant in policy formulation.
Such dichotomous standpoints are, however, somewhat misleading since both groups are involved in policy formulation.
As Collins, Hinings and Walsh note (1978, p. 34), ‘The evidence of the various case studies in local government leads not to the question of whether officers or members control but rather in what ways both are involved in the process of developing and administering policy ?’
FORMAL AND INFORMAL RELATIONSHIPS
Recent studies have suggested that the ‘formal’ stance outlined above is largely redundant, although the reassertion of political control, particularly by the ‘new urban left’, perhaps suggests that it would be premature to ignore it totally.
Given the technical, specialist nature of much contemporary local government activity, officers are clearly often very important.
Yet, as Newton (1976, p. 148) reminds us, while the ‘dictatorship of the official’ thesis has ‘a certain commonsense plausibility…it has very little empirical evidence to support it…because little research has been done on the subject’.
At a formal level the council and its committees meet, with officers in attendance, to consider reports prepared by officers usually incorporating recommendations for action, but precise working relationships vary enormously.
In some authorities officers intervene in discussions at will whereas in others more formal rules apply.
At an informal level officers and  councillors meet frequently at civic functions, receptions and so forth as well as before and after official meetings, and this too, serves to blur the formal relationship between them.
OFFICER-COUNCILLOR RESOURCES
(i)
The professionalism of officers provides a level of technical expertise which councillors frequently lack.
Nevertheless, councillors, through lengthy service on committees, may acquire considerable knowledge of certain subject areas.
Many councillors, moreover, are builders, businessmen, transport workers, accountants and so forth who may have appropriate specialist knowledge.
Councillors can also be advantaged by their knowledge of local circumstances and because the mobility of senior officers often exceeds that of senior councillors.
Indeed in many authorities permanence may be characteristic more of councillors and committee chairmen than the nominally ‘permanent’ officials who advise them.
(ii)
The officers' control of information is particularly important.
Officers collect and present material both to committees and to the whole council.
There are obvious dangers of distortion, omission or misrepresentation, not necessarily for sinister reasons but more likely because of subconscious or professional bias.
Moreover, as Gyford notes (1976, p. 45), ‘officers may also be able to participate in…decision taking by suggesting the appropriate wording of resolutions or amendments and…by…drafting’ minutes of meetings.
Nevertheless, councillors do have access (via pressure groups, the media, party research departments and so on) to alternative sources of information which can, in certain circumstances, enable them to challenge officers successfully.
Likewise, the accumulated experience of councillors in specific functional areas, coupled with their local knowledge, means that, on occasions, they are a force to be reckoned with.
(iii)
Considerable influence accrues to officers in implementing council policy .
Typically, councillors are part-time and serve on only a few committees.
They therefore rarely see ‘the complete picture’ and tend to lose track of an issue once discussion of it has been concluded.
Usually they have few opportunities to check that their instructions are being pursued and almost none to supervise their execution at first hand.
On key issues, or those with important constituency ‘angles’, assiduous councillors will take every opportunity to ascertain progress.
On less important issues, however, not only councillors but sometimes whole committees may ‘lose track’ of implementation, particularly in  larger authorities where there are frequently many pressing problems.
Consequently, not only may inadvertent delay or failure to implement decisions go undetected but officers may attempt to ‘amend’ or ‘shelve’decisions which they dislike (see Greenwood and Wilson, 1982).
CHIEF OFFICER — CHAIRMAN RELATIONSHIPS
The most crucial relationship is that between committee chairman and chief officer.
This in many ways resembles the minister-civil service relationship (see Chapter 5) with the chairman performing a quasi-ministerial role.
The specialism of chief officers and the part-time nature of council service, however, makes the chairman's role arguably more difficult than that of ministers.
On the other hand, policymaking is relatively less complex at the local level, and in many authorities a committee chairman may have acquired considerable specialist knowledge by holding the chairmanship — or serving on the committee concerned-for many years.
Frequently, at pre-committee ‘agenda meetings’ the chief officer goes through recommendations pointing out difficulties and likely contentious items.
A close working relationship is crucial if policy is to develop smoothly and clearly.
Informal linkages often develop because of the frequency of their meetings and the closeness of their working relationship, something fraught both with dangers and opportunities (see Elcock, 1986, ch. 4).
In Birmingham, Lambeth and Croydon the relationship between officers and councillors certainly appears to have been more equal than the ‘dictatorship of the official’ thesis would suggest.
As we have seen, councillors sometimes do have resources (such as experience or local knowledge) to call upon when they confront experts.
These resources are not, by any means, negligible and ‘they are least negligible for the members who generally fill the most important positions’(Newton, 1976, p. 164).
One change which, if implemented, could increase the influence of councillors, would be some form of payment.
As already observed, many councils have members who are effectively full-time (pensioners, housewives, and so forth).
Since 1974 councillors have been entitled to claim an attendance allowance for approved duties (up to a maximum 16.70 per day in 1987).
The average payment made in 1985 was 852 although this obviously concealed considerable variations.
Almost all who commented to the Widdicombe Committee regarded the remuneration of councillors as ‘unsatisfactory both in terms of the basis of payment and the level of payment’(Widdicombe 1986, para. 6.94) and the Committee recommended a basic flat-rate payment and a special responsibility allowance.
Both should vary, it argued, according to the size of authority, with the flat rate ranging from  1,500 p.a. in the smallest to 4,000 p.a. in the largest authorities (Widdicombe, 1986, para. 6.113).
In its 1988 White Paper in response to Widdicombe (Department of Environment et al .,
1988) the government agreed that attendance and financial-loss allowances should be replaced by a basic flat-rate allowance, but not at rates proposed by Widdicombe.
Total expenditure on the scheme should not exceed current expenditure on allowances.
Additionally, the new flat rate should vary by types of authority, not by population.
Whether such sums are sufficient to enable councillors to spend more time becoming more involved in local policy-making is open to question especially given the ‘career building’ problem outlined earlier.
The 1980 Local Government Planning and Land Act gave local authorities the power to pay ‘special responsibility allowances’(SRAs) to their leading members (usually party leaders and committee chairmen).
Widdicombe (1986, para. 6.92) showed that only 43 per cent of local authorities paid special responsibility allowances.
The average payment was 518 p.a.,(1,402 for leaders, 572 for opposition leaders and 501 for committee chairmen).
Widdicombe proposed (para. 6.109) that SRAs should continue but that local authorities should not have the discretion to opt out.
Each local authority, it was suggested, should statutorily be required to draw up a scheme for the disbursement of special responsibility allowances.
This should specify the amounts payable for particular posts and all councillors holding posts stipulated in the scheme should be entitled to claim the amount specified.
The principle seems to be that those people exercising substantial responsibility in local government should be paid accordingly.
In this context neither the attendance allowances nor the SRAs are sufficiently realistic.
A CHANGING ROLE FOR CHIEF OFFICERS: PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS OR PROFESSIONAL BUREAUCRATS?
The relationship between officers and councillors, like that between ministers and civil servants, is of crucial importance.
However, whereas civil servants work exclusively for ministers- and are not usually available to assist the opposition or backbench MPs — local government officers, in keeping with the corporate nature of council decision-making, serve the council as a whole.
Constitutionally chief officers are not responsible to the ruling group or committee chairmen, but to the whole council which they are obliged to keep informed of facts, law and all other considerations relevant to decision-making.
As such they will normally give advice to individual councillors and parties, as well as the full council and committees.
In practice, of course, these constitutional norms fit uneasily  alongside the realities of political life, especially in those authorities divided on party lines.
As Laffin and Young (1985) observe, the break up of the post-war consensus, coupled with the passing of the earlier period of growth and the increased politicization of local government, has made the officer's professional stance increasingly difficult to sustain.
A majority group inevitably feels, politically if not constitutionally, that it has prior claim on officer advice and loyalty, and a right to expect that professional judgements should be subordinated to party policy.
In some of the more highly politicized authorities ‘an unhealthy atmosphere of suspicion’ has developed, with some officers — even some chief executives —‘being labelled as political appointees’(Widdicombe, 1986, para. 6.191).
Even in ‘hung’ councils, where no party has control, senior officers, as Greenwood and Wilson (1986, p. 5) observe, ‘find it difficult to avoid being drawn into the political process’.
Compromises and deals have to be hatched and officers become the main repository of the views and demands of competing factions.
The position may be complicated still further in cases where an officer of one authority is a councillor in another.
In recent years the officers' freedom to divorce professional judgement from political calculation has, in many authorities, diminished sharply, and today's chief officers are increasingly coming ‘to see their role as less than that of a neutral professional or technocrat and more that of a bureaucratic politician’(Laffin and Young, 1985, p. 51).
The Widdicombe Committee's response (1986, ch. 6) to these developments was firmly to assert the need for officers to remain neutral and to serve the council collectively.
While accepting that officers must adapt to political reality — by, for example, being prepared when invited to attend party groups subject to certain safeguards — it rejected any move towards a ‘spoils system’ in local government, and recommended that principal officers should be prohibited from engaging in political activity, including standing for council office.
At the same time it recommended enhanced powers for chief executives to arbitrate in sensitive political matters: for example, applying the rules for party balance on committees, determining whether an individual council has a need to inspect a document or attend a meeting, and deciding which chief officers should attend party group meetings.
Significantly, however, it also recommended safeguards against the dismissal of chief officers including a proposal to prevent dismissal of a chief executive except on the vote of two-thirds of council membership.
As noted earlier, Widdicombe's proposals for a far more powerful chief executive were rejected by the government's 1988 White Paper (Department of Environment et al .,
1988).
Additionally, only the most senior officers in an authority (not all principal officers and above as Widdicombe proposed) will be banned from being members of other  main councils or being active politically.
Prohibition will apply to chief executives, chief officers, deputies and others who regularly advise or act on behalf of their councils.
The government estimates that at least 10,000 people will be prohibited from political activity — such individuals will also be prevented from speaking or writing on controversial issues unless the council deems it part of their job.
Employees of joint boards and joint committees will, if the White Paper is implemented, be allowed to be councillors in constituent authorities provided they are not nominated for board or committee membership, or are prohibited by their job.
Council employees will be restricted to twenty-six days' paid leave for duties as councillors.
Political advisers on the rates will not be allowed despite the committee's recommendation they should be available to all party groups.
Despite the changes outlined in the 1988 White Paper, chief officers in many authorities remain likely to experience continuing tensions between the professional requirements of neutrality and the political demands of councillors.
As Laffin and Young (1985, p. 59) conclude, ‘it is quite clear that chief officers are going to have to live with an increasingly uncertain and tempestuous political environment and any new ground rules will be of limited value’.
A FALSE DICHOTOMY?
To what extent is it realistic to see local political relationships in officer-council terms?
One of the underlying themes of corporate planning is the notion of partnership between officers and councillors.
Elected members and officers are now increasingly working together on council activities.
As Collins et al .,
(1978, p. 42) observe, what frequently happens is that ‘a joint councillor-officer elite arises, often in a very visible form, as the major power centre of the local authority’.
According to this school of thought there is neither the domination of an officer nor a member elite but rather the domination of an officer-member elite (see Saunders, 1980) but this joint-elite model can be criticized because it often assumes that, important as leading officers and councillors are, they have a monopoly of decision-making influence.
In other words, this model excludes from consideration the influences on policy-making which come from outside this officer–councillor elite (Wilson, 1988).
Any realistic model should incorporate more elements than simply the relative importance of leading officers and councillors, otherwise a distorted and simplistic picture of power inside local authorities will emerge.
Too often the literature gives the impression of leading councillors and officers being a united, cohesive group.
In practice, relationships are frequently characterized by tensions and conflicts.
Politicians do frequently reject plans presented to them by officers.
Additionally, it is  important to recognize that there are various other influences upon policy-making within the town hall.
On occasion the ruling party group as a whole , not just its leading councillors, can be crucial in decision-making (Stoker and Wilson, 1986).
Likewise tensions between departments and within specific departments can have important effects on policy.
In a ‘hung council’ deals hammered out between rival party groups can often have either a direct or indirect effect on local policy-making.
It is, therefore, necessary to move beyond the narrow officer-councillor confines and recognize that the internal world of local authorities is highly complex and diverse.
The above approach to the distribution of power inside local authorities leaves out of account the increasing influence of central government departments upon local authorities in crucial areas, notably finance (see Dunleavy and Rhodes, 1987).
Nevertheless, even given the increasing constraints imposed by the centre upon local authorities (see Chapter 10) it is still important to recognize that the centre only narrows the scope of decision-making — it does not determine it.
Internal administrative routines and power relationships affect local policy processes by modifying and mediating external influences, and they can also provide an independent dynamic of their own.
Perhaps local politics needs to be seen as a series of shifting alliances, varying over time and from issue to issue.
To distinguish too sharply between officers and councillors is frequently to distort reality (Laffin and Young, 1985; Laffin, 1986).
Senior elected and non-elected personnel might be dominant in some authorities on some issues but this is only one possible alliance; second-tier officers and party activists might combine effectively in other policy areas — the permutations are infinite.
While networks and alliances vary enormously, one conclusion is clear: there is far more to local authority decision-making than simply the officer-councillor dimension.
10 CENTRAL-LOCAL GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIPS
Although local authorities are accountable to the local electorate, their powers and a significant proportion of their finance are derived ultimately from Parliament (which in practice is invariably dominated by government).
For local councillors this sometimes presents a stark dilemma: whether to put first the perceived interests of local people, or the directives and requests of central government.
Central-local relations, in fact, are crucial to understanding the way local government works and to recognizing its role within the wider administrative system.
Unfortunately the relationship is far from simple, being characterized, according to Rhodes (1981, p. 28), by ‘ambiguity, confusion and complexity’.
Relationships vary over time, from authority to authority and from service to service.
At one level, the scale of central intervention in local authorities can be measured; between 1979 and 1988 some fifty Bills having a direct effect on local government were laid before Parliament.
Some see such intervention as heralding the end of elected local government but, as Goldsmith (1986, p. xiv) observes: ‘Britain has not become a totally centralized state, nor is central government's control over local authorities’ activities yet total…
British local authorities still retain considerable discretion over the way in which they run their services and the level of service they provide'.
Central direction has increased since 1979 but local authorities are far more than simply field agents of central government departments.
There is a diversity and vitality that makes the study of central-local government relationships particularly fascinating.
This chapter begins by examining three analytical models and discusses their usefulness as tools for analysis.
Formal relationships are then examined, followed by a discussion of what happens in practice.
There is an account of the changing nature of central-local relations in the 1980s and, finally, some radical literature is examined and alternative analytical perspectives presented.
Analytical models
Until relatively recently central-local relationships were viewed rather simplistically in legal, institutional and financial terms.
This approach  not only ignored wider political and administrative factors but, as Regan (1983, p. 45) observes, was too limiting: it was unable to encompass the ‘variability, ambiguity, complexity and reciprocity’ that subsequent studies have suggested obtain in central-local relations.
Broadly speaking, three major models which attempt to offer insights into central-local relations can be identified, and these are discussed below.
THE AGENCY MODEL
This model sees local authorities as having a subordinate relationship to central government with little or no discretion in the task of implementing national policies.
This was the traditional view which held sway for many years.
Local authorities were subject not only to central government-initiated legislative changes, but financially were seen as increasingly dependent on central government grants.
As late as 1966 W. A. Robson wrote: ‘Local authorities have become subservient to the central government, mainly but not entirely because of their excessive dependence on central grants’(p. 149).
While Robson's view is, today, largely rejected by academic observers, the agency model is still widely adhered to by many practitioners at local level — both councillors and officers — who in the second half of the 1980s see central controls inhibiting their freedom to act in what they regard as the local interest.
The difficulty with the agency model is that it produces a somewhat ‘blinkered’ analysis of what is a highly complex relationship.
While local government, like all public authorities, is subject to Parliament, its relationship with government is not purely legalistic; political and administrative factors are also involved.
Likewise, the proportion of local government revenue income derived from central government has fluctuated sharply.
Between 1958/9 and 1979/80 it rose sharply (in England from 36.1 per cent to 48.5 per cent), but this did not automatically mean more central control, any more than the subsequent fall by 1984/5 to 39.2 per cent meant increased local freedom (all figures from Travers, 1986, table app. 7).
There is, furthermore, substantial empirical evidence of variations in local policy outputs.
In some areas the agency model holds good (for example, county councils serve as agents of the Department of Transport in constructing motorways and trunk roads) but in general it conveys an exaggerated picture of central domination, particularly as there is a great deal of evidence of continued local discretion in service provision.
Several studies, for example, show that policy outputs vary from authority to authority in a manner which is not simply related to differing resources or needs.
According to Boaden (1971), party control clearly affects   expenditure patterns.
He found that Labour councils spent more on education and built more council houses than Conservative councils.
Labour councils also paid higher subsidies in the housing field than other councils, irrespective of needs or resource availability.
Conservative councils, by contrast, spent more on police than Labour.
Alt (1971, p. 60) has likewise shown that before Health Service reorganization in 1974 there was a ‘consistent, positive and generally significant correlation between Labour representation and spending on local health services’.
Davies (1968 and 1972) develops similar themes in the context of social services.
Likewise, Duke and Edgell (1981), in a study of two northern cities, demonstrate the importance of local political control with reference to spending cuts.
Variations in Expenditure in Greater Manchester, 1987/88 ()
Distinguishing between a multiplicity of variables in accounting for policy variations is, of course, a hazardous exercise, but despite the methodological difficulties it seems clear that a simple agency model, with local authorities implementing national policies with little or no discretion, is far from accurate.
Table 10.1 illustrates this with reference to revenue expenditure on basic services by the ten district councils in the Greater Manchester area in 1987/8.
Similar variations  are evident on a national scale.
For example, in 1987/8 Bexley planned to spend 408 per head of its population on education while East Sussex budgeted only 213 (Source:Local Government Comparative Statistics 1988, CIPFA, 1988).
Case studies also reveal evidence of local discretion in other respects.
In numerous policy areas (such as smoke control, comprehensive education, selling council houses) central government has often been frustrated by local authorities.
Dearlove (1973, p. 20), for example, observed that the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea frequently ignored or resisted central government ‘advice and direction’.
He concluded: ‘The impact of central government upon day-to-day decisions of local authorities often depends on local responsiveness, and the preparedness of local authorities to accept advice or guidance’.
Distinctiveness, albeit within a framework established by the centre, appears to be an unmistakable feature of local policy-making.
THE PARTNERSHIP MODEL
A second model, often regarded as the ‘ideal’ at the local level, sees authorities as more or less co-equal partners of central government in providing services.
Traditional writers — noting the increased central constraints upon local government which have undoubtedly occurred during the twentieth century — often depicted a move from an earlier period of partnership to one of agent.
In fact, the partnership model, as Regan (1983, p. 46) puts it, ‘is so loose as to be almost vacuous’.
He continues:
Only in a formal constitutional sense are the government departments and the local authorities equal.
In the sense of working together on common tasks partnership is a banal truism — of course both central and local government are involved in education, housing, transport, social services etc. but having said that there is little else one can say under the umbrella of partnership.
For Regan, then, the partnership model is too imprecise to be a useful analytical tool; hence the need for an alternative insight.
THE POWER-DEPENDENCE MODEL
This model postulates that both central departments and local authorities have resources which each can use against the other and against other organizations.
In a sense this is a sophisticated variant of the partnership model, in that dependence is reciprocal.
However, the relationship is far more complex and varied than that postulated by the  partnership model.
Resources other than the legal/constitutional and financial are built into the model: for example, political, informational and implementational resources.
While there are likely to be inequalities in the distribution of the resources, these are not necessarily cumulative.
Rhodes (1979, pp. 29–31) observes:
The fact that a local authority or a central department lacks one resource does not mean that it lacks others.
One resource could be substituted for another.
For example, a central department lacking the constitutional/legal resources to prevent (or encourage) a specific local initiative can attempt to get its way by withholding (or supplying) financial resources.
Conversely, a local authority which has been refused financial resources can attempt to reverse this state of affairs by embarrassing the central department.
Press and television reports on the adverse consequences of the centre's decision may lead to the decision being reconsidered.
In this model power is seen in relative terms, hinging upon a process of bargaining and exchange.
The power-dependence model undoubtedly offers a useful analytical tool for exploring central-local relationships.
It reveals clearly that neither central nor local government should be seen as monolithic blocs and that the relationship varies according to the agencies, personnel, policy areas and goals involved.
For all its sophistication, however, it fails to place central-local relationships in the wider political and economic setting.
The focus is upon inter-organizational relationships, and changing political and economic circumstances receive insufficient emphasis.
As Dunsire (1982, p. 21) has written, ‘the bargaining network model has been made to look a little shop-soiled…
See how fiscal crisis and a streak of Thatcherite obduracy fills one's mind again with the ‘reality’ of the power of the state, when a government chooses to use it'.
In further reflection on his own model Rhodes (1986, p. 28) moves away from a concern with inter-organizational analysis to a focus upon policy communities.
He argues that the very phrase ‘central-local relationships’ suggests a bias towards the analysis of institutional relationships.
Such analysis, Rhodes maintains, ‘does not always provide an adequate account of policy systems…
Intergovernmental theory with its emphasis on fragmentation, professionalisation and policy network is more appropriate’.
Dissatisfaction with the models outlined above has led Chandler (1988a, p. 185) to put forward what he calls the stewardship model.
He regards the stewardship metaphor as useful in the sense that a steward is delegated considerable authority by his master to order his estates.
Chandler observes that the steward will on occasions consult with his  employer on how best he should manage his estate and may often wish to suggest new policies or point out deficiencies in existing strategies.
Chandler continues (p. 186):
A capable landlord will listen to the advice of his expert manager and may often be persuaded by his arguments.
The master, nevertheless, will always retain the power either to accept or reject the advice.
Should the steward fail to obey these orders he will be compelled to change his conduct or, like the councillors of Lambeth, Liverpool and Clay Cross, be removed from office.
The central-local relationship is dynamic and multi-dimensional, and no one model seems capable of portraying it in its entirety.
Of course, analysing any relationship depends upon the angle from which it is viewed.
Saunders (1982, p. 55) illustrates this with reference to a Conservative government committed to a monetarist economic strategy.
For the government, he writes,
the problem is how to develop and enforce policies involving cuts in services and reductions in the public sector workforce in the face of local resistance and antagonism on the part of Labour local authorities, public sector unions, organised groups of consumers of state services, and so on.
From the point of view of local Labour controlled councils, on the other hand, the problem is how best to counter central government policies and directives in order to fulfil election pledges and principled commitments to a ‘no cuts/no redundancies’ platform.
The ‘top-down’ view of central-local relationships can be very different from the ‘bottom-up’view; both perspectives require recognition.
The formal framework
This section examines formal relationships between central government and local authorities, an essential prerequisite to the analysis of actual working relationships on pp. 194–98.
LEGISLATION
The sovereignty of Parliament means that it can create, abolish or amend the powers of local authorities as it determines.
For example, the 1985 Local Government Act abolished the GLC and the six metropolitan counties with effect from I April 1986 and the 1988 Local Government Act abolished ILEA with effect from 1990.
While legislation  is, therefore, an obvious means of central control of local authorities, statute also serves to restrict the role of central government, as the Tameside dispute (1976) demonstrated.
Following reorganization the Labour-controlled Tameside Metropolitan District made arrangements for the introduction of comprehensive education, but in May 1976, shortly before the changeover was scheduled, the Conservatives won control of the local authority and they were pledged to retain some grammar schools.
In June 1976 the Labour Secretary of State for Education and Science issued Tameside a directive to proceed with comprehensive reorganization on the grounds that to do otherwise at such a late stage would be unreasonable.
This intervention was under Section 68 of the Education Act, 1944, which states that when a local authority is deemed by the minister to be acting unreasonably, intervention by the minister is appropriate.
Tameside resisted, and when the matter came before the courts the House of Lords determined that the minister's decision was invalid, holding that there was no basis upon which the Secretary of State could say that Tameside was acting unreasonably.
Legislation, as this case suggests, is not simply an instrument of central control; it can also protect local authorities against central direction which is not backed by statutory powers.
Goldsmith (1986, p. xv) observes that concern with legislation as a means of controlling central-local government relations and the parallel use of the courts to enforce government intentions has been a feature of post-1979 Conservative governments.
‘This rather formal approach contrasts neatly with the more informal approach generally adopted by central governments in their relations with local authorities in the years up to 1979’.
There is, perhaps, something of a different operating style to the pre-1979 era.
CIRCULARS
Circulars, issued by government departments to appropriate local authorities, are a major instrument of central-local communications.
(In the year ending April 1981, according to the DOE, 1,873 circulars and similar communications were issued to local authorities; however, in the following year the figure was only 592.)
Although they are often cited as an instrument of central control, their effectiveness is difficult to determine because individual local authorities- and sometimes even different departments within the same authority — react differently to them.
Indeed, many circulars do not contain central directives, and do not have statutory force, being issued simply for guidance and advice.
Moreover, as Richardson and Jordan (1979, p. 107) observe, circulars often follow exhaustive discussion ‘in the labyrinth of central/local consultative machinery’.
Consequently, it can be misleading to see  circulars as evidence of central departments attempting to regulate local authorities.
JUDICIAL CONTROL
Local authorities have no powers except those conferred upon them by statute, and when they take action which is not sanctioned by the law they are said to be acting ultra vires (beyond the powers).
Any councillors (or others) who support expenditure on ultra vires acts resulting in loss may be made financially responsible.
They might also be banned from holding public office for a period determined by the courts.
Ultra vires is obviously a restrictive doctrine (although local authorities are permitted to raise a 2p rate to finance functions not specifically authorized by statute).
Its effect is to expose to restraining action in the courts any local authority activity not backed by statutory authority.
One controversial instance of this occurred in 1981 when the Greater London Council's ‘Fare's Fair’ policy — which introduced heavy subsidization of London Transport fares from the rates — was declared illegal by the House of Lords.
In January 1983, however, the High Court ruled that the GLC had power to launch a similar plan designed to reduce London Transport fares by 25 per cent.
As this example suggests the use of the courts is highly controversial: the 1981 decision led to accusations that an ‘undemocratic’ court ruling had substituted the views of judges for those of councillors whose policies had been endorsed by the local electorate.
Grant (1986, p. 203) argues that the spillover into the courts of cases such as that cited above is ‘the direct and inevitable product of the worsening state of central-local relations’.
DEFAULT POWERS
These powers, granting a minister default powers over local authorities which, in his view, fail to provide a satisfactory service, are very rarely used.
A minister may temporarily remove a particular service from a local authority and administer it himself (or authorize someone else to act) if he is dissatisfied with a local authority's performance.
Two cases, Clay Cross (1972) and Norwich (1981–2), are particularly interesting: here, as with the GLC ‘Fare's Fair’ issue, the party-political dimension was very much in evidence.
(i) Clay Cross (1972)
This dispute arose when the Labour-controlled Clay Cross Urban District Council refused to operate provisions in the Housing Finance Act, 1972, requiring council house rents to be raised to the ‘fair rent’ level defined by the Act.
The Conservative government ultimately appointed a Housing Commissioner to take over responsibility for the housing function but in 1974 the local authority ceased to exist as a result of local government reorganization.
Eleven Clay Cross councillors were surcharged for the money which would have been obtained had the Act been implemented and they were also disqualified from holding public office for a period.
In practice, however, the commissioner found it difficult to operate because of non-cooperation by the council: the use of default powers may be clear in statute but implementation can be more problematic.
Rhodes (1981, p. 17) observes that ‘although central government has an impressive list of controls at its disposal they constitute only a potential for control’.
(ii) Norwich (1981–2)
One important default power is that contained in the Housing Act, 1980, which can be brought into effect whenever the minister considers that tenants are having difficulty in exercising their right to buy a council property ‘effectively and expeditiously’.
In December 1981 the Secretary of State for the Environment threatened to activate these default powers in Norwich, where the Labour-controlled city council had sold only 250 properties in the first year of the Act.
The minister's position was ultimately upheld by the Court of Appeal in February 1982.
In his judgment Lord Denning suggested that if Norwich would ‘get a move on’ in processing applications to buy there might be no need for the minister to act.
This in fact happened.
Norwich agreed to take on an extra twelve staff and to clear the backlog of applications.
DEPARTMENTAL INSPECTORS
The use of inspectors as a form of central supervision goes back to the Poor Law reform of 1834.
Basically only four local authority services are subject to oversight by inspectors: education, child care, police and fire.
While such inspectors are usually required to satisfy their departments that local services are provided efficiently and that minimum standards are being met, their role has increasingly been educative rather than coercive.
As Stanyer (1976, p. 223) observes, they ‘both educate and learn…and…can carry knowledge of best practice directly from one authority to another’.
APPELLATE FUNCTIONS OF MINISTERS
Some statutes require local authorities to submit schemes or orders to the relevant minister for approval (for example, structure plans) or confirmation (for example , compulsory purchase orders).
Likewise, ministers exercise various appellate functions in adjudicating between citizens and local authorities (such as appeals against a local authority's refusal of planning permission).
Despite the quasi-judicial character of the process it is likely that his appellate functions serve to ‘heighten a minister's perception of his supervisory role’(Boynton, 1982, p. 205).
FINANCE
Central government attempts to control local authorities by: a) carefully regulating the amount of money which they can spend locally, and b) scrutinizing the way in which money is actually spent.
The increasing dependence of local government on financial support from the centre has already been noted, and through a variety of devices central government now restricts local-authority revenue and capital expenditure (see pp. 198–205).
Although empirical research (for example, Boaden, 1971) suggests ‘that the financial relationship has [not]decreased the decision-making autonomy of individual authorities, it is generally believed in local government that it has led to increased, and increasing control over local government as a whole ’(Alexander 1982a, p. 148).
This section, however, only examines the scrutiny of local-authority expenditure.
Traditionally, government-appointed district auditors have been responsible for examining most local authority accounts.
The Local Government Act, 1972, allowed local authorities to choose between district auditors and private auditors (who needed to be approved by the secretary of state) but the Local Government Finance Act, 1982, removed an authority's right to choose its own auditor.
The Act also established an Audit Commission for Local Authorities in England and Wales which became operational in 1983.
Auditors are no longer employed by the Secretary of State, although the commission itself is appointed by the Secretary of State after consultation with local authority associations and professional accountancy bodies, and he is empowered to issue directions which the commission must observe.
The commission has responsibility for appointing auditors for local authorities using either the District Auditor service or auditors from the private sector.
Widely seen as part of the Thatcher government's policy of ‘privatization’, the 1982 Act effectively allows specific private auditors to be imposed upon local government.
It also requires auditors to satisfy themselves that the local authority concerned ‘has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources’.
Once the proposals in the 1988 post-Widdicombe White Paper (Department of Environment et al .,
1988) are implemented councils will be required to circulate auditors' reports to all members and make them public.
Far from being the lap-dog of central government, however, the Audit Commission has often flexed its muscles against the centre as well as against local authorities.
Its 1986 report on community care, for example, criticized not only under-funding but the pattern of organizational fragmentation and confusion that began in central departments and worked its way down.
Likewise in the area of council housing the commission (1986) pointed to the crises of management and finance resulting partly from central government's tighter restrictions on capital expenditure (Gray and Jenkins, 1987, pp. 312–13).
The Audit Commission can, therefore, be something of a two-edged sword in the context of central-local relationships.
Working relationships
The formal legal framework of central-local relations needs to be set against actual working relationships.
These relationships are extremely complex and varied.
Griffith (1966), for example, showed that government departments varied enormously in the extent to which they sought to exercise control over local authorities.
However, three major types of relationship could be identified:
1
laissez-faire — in 1966 Griffith cited the Ministry of Health as a department which exercised minimum intervention.
2
regulatory — ensuring that minimum standards of service provision are maintained and occasionally enforcing national policies on local authorities (for example, the Home Office);
3
promotional — here the central department either persuades or forces local authorities to adopt and implement national policies (for example, the DES).
Developing this theme further, Regan (1977, p. 34) shows that there can also be markedly different outlooks in different parts of the same government department — for example, the ‘DES is not as promotional in the youth service as in primary education’.
This further reinforces the view that central government is not a monolith.
As Rhodes (1981p. 18) observes, ‘it is misleading to talk of central control.
Rather there are different types and degrees of control exerted by the various constituent units of central government’.
This point has been reinforced further by the findings of Goldsmith and Newton (1986) who show that, while the Thatcher government has been very directive towards local authorities on council house sales, by contrast it hardly involves itself in matters of environmental health (a reflection of the much lower priority the Thatcher government gives to this policy area).
‘Consequently, local authorities have somewhat greater discretion  in the environmental health area than they do in relation to council house sales’(p. 103).
In 1977, in similar vein, a report by the Central Policy Review Staff (1977) highlighted the great complexity which existed in channels of communication between central government departments and local authorities.
It showed that central government departments, in making and implementing policies, acted largely in isolation from each other and conducted their relationships with local authorities accordingly.
The CPRS recommended that central government should deal with local authorities more on an interdepartmental programme basis than on a separate service-by-service basis.
Regan has argued that there is an even more fundamental quality to be added to the variability, ambiguity, confusion and complexity outlined above, namely reciprocity .
He remarks (1983, p. 45) that Friend, Power and Yewlett (1974) in their study on the expansion of Droitwich ‘revealed government departments and local authorities closely involved on a common task.
The process was marked by negotiation and bargaining and in these circumstances the hierarchical central-local relationship broke down and constraints were imposed mutually on all sides’.
It is clearly naive to talk in general terms about ‘central government control’ over local authorities, or indeed to generalize about the relationship at all.
As Rhodes (1981, p. 27) observes, in future ‘the starting point must be the complexity of interactions and the constraints imposed thereby on both levels of government’.
LOCAL AUTHORITY ASSOCIATIONS AND PROFESSIONAL BODIES
Griffith (1966, p. 23) suggests that:
Any description of central and local public authorities in Britain would be incomplete without some mention of the role of the local authority associations.
It is difficult to exaggerate their importance in influencing legislation, government policies and administration and in acting as coordinators and channels of local authority opinion.
In 1973 three major local authority associations were established: the Association of County Councils (ACC), the Association of Metropolitan Authorities (AMA) and the Association of District Councils (ADE).
The extensive consultation which takes place between central government and these associations should not be seen as a generous concession by government but as ‘the inevitable response in a situation where the centre lacks detailed control.
The associations act as filters, ranking matters according to importance, aggregating individual cases  so that wider implications can be recognised’(Richardson and Jordan, 1979, pp. 105–6).
All three associations are firmly divided along party-political lines (Isaac-Henry, 1984); there is thus no single united voice of local government which further reduces local government's impact upon Whitehall.
Nevertheless, against this backcloth, the associations have regular and detailed consultation with government departments, both formal and informal.
It is the associations rather than individual local authorities which are invariably the point of contact between centre and localities.
There is also a range of specialist bodies which similarly represent aspects of local government at national level — for example, the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives (SOLACE).
Others, like the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accounting (CIPFA), are professional associations with large numbers of members at officer level within local government (and sometimes also within central government as well).
Such professional links also cross the public/ private sector divide.
Policy statements which emanate from government departments are often, in practice, the product of prior consultation and negotiation between the centre and one or more of the many associations — not least the professional bodies, which on occasions serve to ‘unite’ civil servants and local authority employees.
One effect of this, of course, as Goldsmith and Newton (1986, p. 103) observe, is that each policy arena involves different networks (or policy communities) of central and local actors.
They show, for example, how the full range of local authority associations, together with such professional bodies as SOLACE or CIPFA, have been deeply involved in financial matters but that their involvement is less apparent in other policy areas such as fire, education, housing and transport which are marked by their own configuration of interests (such as the Institute of Housing Managers) all of which have their own style of central-local relations.
Indeed Goldsmith and Newton (1986, p. 104) argue that there is a sense in which ‘the phrase central-local government relations is a misnomer; what the term really refers to is a set of London-based relations between central government and the national local government community.
What seems clear from the above analysis is that local authorities operate within a wider political system incorporating a range of national organizations and institutions, all of which can have a direct effect upon local government.
Political parties, professional associations and local authority associations are frequently the major actors in what is often referred to as the ‘national local government system’(see Rhodes 1988).
Such networks are extremely complex and diverse but interrelationships between central government agencies and the  localities via the above organizations need to be acknowledged in any realistic model of central-local relationships.
Chandler, however,(1988a, p. 186) provides a timely reminder when he concludes that it ‘is a frequent but pathetic fallacy in political analysis to believe that power necessarily accrues to those who habitually walk with the great’.
THE CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE (CCLGF)
In some instances formal committees and similar bodies are established to provide a mechanism for the exchange of information and views between central government and the various interests within the national local government community.
One such body, formed in 1975, is the Consultative Council on Local Government Finance (CCLGF).
However, as Alexander (1982a, p. 158) observes, ‘The creation of this body was announced’ in a way which ‘suggested that the council was intended more to facilitate central control of the economy than to increase local government's capacity to protect its position and to maximise its influence on the government and on individual departments’.
The CCLGF meets six or seven times a year and is chaired by the Secretary of State for the Environment.
Meetings are attended by ministers and senior officials from the DOE, Treasury and other interested departments, along with elected members and officers of the local authority associations.
Although it has no formal terms of reference, its discussions principally concern grants and expenditure levels.
According to Binder (1982, p. 36)‘the great significance of financial issues in the central/local relationship has led to the CCLGF attaining a predominant status in the hierarchy of Central Government/Local Authority consultation bodies’.
CCLGF business is first discussed in a body known as the Official Steering Group (OSG) which consists of senior officials of the associations and their advisers on the one side, and of senior government officials on the other:
Ostensibly the main purpose of the OSG is to filter out and deal with items of lesser importance and to clarify issues for the ‘political’ side.
Of course, in practice, matters of substance can be dealt with in the technical setting.
A second tier of officers' groups have specialised remits and report to the Consultative Council through the OSG (Richardson and Jordan, 1979, p. 108).
Furthermore, as Binder (1982, p. 38) notes, discussions of CCLGF issues between leading association members and ministers often take place on a party political level outside the formal council.
On some  issues such discussions ‘have had a very substantial influence on government policy — indeed an influence far in excess of that of the CCLGF’.
The development of the CCLGF has been mirrored in other policy fields (such as housing) by the creation of similar consultative bodies together with various working parties, specialist groups and so forth.
Such channels provide important mechanisms for the exchange of information and influence and, together with the predominance of the associations in the central-local consultative process, have possibly resulted in a reduction of direct discussions on policy between individual local authorities and individual central departments.
While bodies like the CCLGF may ‘not greatly’ have ‘increased the power of local government’(Alexander, 1982a, p. 163) they enable local authorities (increasingly through their association representatives) to obtain access to, and collaborate with, departmental ministers and officials.
Whatever the centre's theoretical potential for power might be, in practice the realities of policy formulation demand some collaboration between both levels of government.
Changing relationships: the 1980s
During the 1970s and 1980s overt tensions in central-local relationships became increasingly evident.
One of the roots of the problem was the sharp cutback of financial resources provided by the centre, but this needs to be seen alongside the emergence of strongly ideological politics at both central and local levels.
The Thatcher government came to power in 1979 deeply suspicious of the size of the public sector and the levels of public expenditure.
Local authorities (especially ‘high-spending’ Labour-controlled councils) were prime targets, particularly since local government accounted for a quarter of public expenditure in 1979/80.
Consequently the period after 1979 witnessed a number of major developments with important repercussions for central-local relations.
This section focuses on three of these: a) the Local Government, Planning and Land Act, 1980; b) the Local Government Finance Act, 1982; c) the Rates Act, .1984.
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PLANNING AND LAND ACT, 1980
Prior to this Act the traditional approach of central government had been to view local expenditure in global terms; hence, as long as local government spending as a whole remained on target, individual authorities spending above the norm were not penalized.
The 1980  Act, however, which introduced the block grant (see p. 162), allowed the government to assess how much each authority needs to spend and to allocate grant in terms of how far those assessments were breached.
As Greenwood (1982, p. 259) noted, ‘The Conservative Government's attempts to extract deeper cuts from higher rather than the lower spending authorities represent a movement away’ from the former ‘philosophy’.
This new ‘philosophy’, enshrined in the 1980 Act, was to lead to increasing central-local tensions during the 1980s as central government sought to impose, and reinforce where necessary, controls over the expenditure of individual local authorities.
Under the former ‘rate support grant’(RSG) arrangement, as a local authority increased its expenditure, government grant met a constant percentage of the additional expenditure.
Since 1981, however, as an authority's total spending rises above a standard level, set by central government for each individual authority, the proportion of additional expenditure met by the centre drops, thereby placing a heavier burden on local rates and deterring increased expenditure.
Each authority is set a ‘grant related expenditure assessment’(GREA) based on computation by the Department of the Environment of how much each authority needs to spend to achieve a common level of services with other authorities of the same type.
Expenditure above the GREA level results in a reduction of block grant, with a ‘steepening’ effect built in above a certain threshold to penalize the high spenders.
As Rhodes (1984, p. 270) comments, following the 1980 Act ‘for the first time…central government has direct (rather than indirect) controls over the levels of expenditure of the individual local authority’.
Soon after the introduction of GREAs the government recognized a danger that some authorities might use them as targets, with the consequence that some authorities spending below their GREAs might be encouraged to spend more, while those spending far above them might find the task of cutting back to GREA level too difficult.
Fearing that this might produce an aggregate increase in local government spending the government responded by introducing a second expenditure-control mechanism known as targets.
based on inflation increases and previous authority expenditure patterns, each authority was set a volume expenditure target by the Department of the Environment.
Authorities exceeding their target incurred a penalty which involved loss of grant for each additional pound of expenditure per head of population above target.
Essentially the GREA and target mechanisms were two separate systems.
The former assessed need to spend by an authority as a basis for calculating entitlement to block grant; the latter was a system of expenditure controls based around the progressive removal of grant above the ‘target’ expenditure level set for each authority.
The effect, however, was that authorities had to live with both a GREA and a  target and authorities spending above their target suffered a penalty even if their expenditure was within the GREA figure.
The superimposition of targets and penalties upon the GREA-based block-grant mechanism made the system very complex, whilst the uncertainties engendered by fluctuations in targets, penalties, GREAs and the like inhibited financial planning and encouraged a tendency for authorities to protect themselves by building up reserves (Audit Commission, 1984b; Comptroller and Auditor General, 1985).
Because quite modest increases in spending above target were also liable to result in considerable amounts of lost grant the system was also very unpopular among authorities, especially in the Conservative dominated shires where penalties fell with particular severity.
In order to meet some of these criticisms  penalties and targets were abolished in 1986.
However, the same block grant system was retained, and the GREA formulae tightened to produce at the local level deductions of grant for all levels of expenditure .
The practical effect of this for most authorities is that grant decreases as spending rises and vice versa, with some authorities spending so far above GREA that they receive no block grant whatsoever.
Indeed in some cases, where needs and resource assessments (upon which GREAs are calculated) are particularly severe, authorities lose all grant entitlement even before their expenditure reaches GREA.
As the government's own Green Paper,Paying for Local Government , acknowledges (p. 33), the block-grant system remains ‘highly complex and difficult to understand…it distorts and obscures the relationship between changes in expenditure and changes in local taxes’.
In 1986, as part of its wider proposals for the reform of local government finance, the government declared its intention to introduce a new grant system.
In essence it proposes to replace block grant by a new needs grant (based on a simplified GREA) and a standard grant (consisting of a fixed sum per adult).
Specific grants will also be reviewed.
Such an arrangement, if introduced, will not only simplify the grant system but should also be more neutral in effect (by neither penalizing nor rewarding authorities for expenditure above or below GREA — see Wilson, 1986, p. 52).
However, the new GREAs, as well as the level of standard grant, will continue to be determined by central government.
After the repeated attempts by central government in the 1980s to control local authority spending through grant manipulations, local government anxieties are hardly likely to be quelled by the new proposals.
The 1980 Act also considerably tightened central controls upon capital expenditure .
Government approvals now mainly apply to programmes rather than individual projects and relate to only one year at a time.
Local authorities receive allocations for capital expenditure under five blocks: housing, education, transport, personal social  services and other services.
Allocations can be transferred between authorities and, to a limited extent (currently 10 per cent), between years.
They can also be supplemented by capital receipts and trading profits.
Authorities can also switch expenditure between services to a greater extent than hitherto, as virement (transfer) between blocks is permitted.
These new found freedoms, however, are somewhat illusory.
The main effect of the 1980 Act has been to reinforce earlier borrowing controls by expenditure controls, thereby bringing ‘all capital spending [by local authorities]within the scope of control’(Travers, 1986, p. 142).
Allocations relate not only to borrowing but also to expenditure (that is, loan sanction is given in line with expenditure allocations) and are determined nationally to meet government public expenditure targets.
Individual authorities overspending their allocations are likely to suffer consequent reductions in subsequent years; indeed, those deliberately overspending supplemented allocations can be prevented from letting new contracts by ministerial order.
As, moreover, deficiencies have appeared in the capital control mechanisms, so refinements have been introduced.
Thus as the sale of council houses in the early 1980s produced sizeable capital receipts, and led to substantial capital ‘overspending’, the proportion which could be used to supplement capital receipts was reduced (standing at 20 per cent by 1987).
As with attempts to control revenue, these capital controls were widely unpopular in local government, and authoritatively criticized as uncertain, inefficient and wasteful (Audit Commission, 1985b).
While by 1986 the government itself conceded some of these criticisms, it flatly rejected calls for the abolition of capital controls and put forward proposals which, if introduced, seem likely to maintain these for the foreseeable future (Paying for Local Government , ch. 6).
THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE ACT, 1982
This measure strengthened still further the expenditure controls over local authorities imposed by the 1980 Local Government, Planning and Land Act.
It contained two main provisions.
First, it legitimized retrospectively the grant penalties associated with targets set in 1981/2 and 1982/3 and set out the context in which expenditure guidance or targets could be issued in future years.
Secondly, it prohibited local authorities from levying supplementary rates.
This latter provision effectively requires rate precepts to be made or issued for complete financial years.
Although intended to further curtail local government expenditure — by requiring authorities to meet any unforeseen expenditure from existing budgets — the effect may well have been to persuade local authorities to set high initial rates (to provide adequate balances to meet unexpected contingencies or loss of income).
However, as 
Greenwood (1982, p. 263) emphasizes, the Act also enables the Secretary of State to withdraw ‘grant during the middle of the financial year from any authority which in his view is overspending’.
He adds, ‘it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the government has taken power:(a) to set for each authority what is to be regarded as the ‘needed’ level of spending,(b) to enforce that level of spending by manipulation of grant'.
To avoid the prospect of local authorities, whose rate fund becomes overdrawn within a year, from ‘going bankrupt’, the Act provides that authorities concerned may be given permission to borrow temporarily on revenue account, but only on such terms as the Secretary of State may impose.
THE RATES ACT, 1984
Despite the 1980 and 1982 Acts local government in 1983/4 was still, according to government estimates, overspending by 770m.
In a White Paper (Rates: Proposals for Rate Limitation and the Reform of the Rating System , 1983) blame for this was placed mainly on excessive spending by a small number of authorities, which the government proposed to curtail by a new control mechanism: rate-capping.
The White Paper's proposals were broadly enshrined in the Rates Act, 1984, which empowers the Secretary of State for Environment:(i) to limit the rates of named authorities (selective rate-capping)(authorities spending less than 10m, or below their GREA, are excluded from the selective scheme);(ii) to cap the rates of all local authorities in England and Wales subject to an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament.
(In Scotland, the Secretary of State already possessed similar, although not identical, powers to control local authority expenditure under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions)(Scotland) Act, 1981.)
The 1984 Rates Act also requires councils to consult with representatives of ‘commercial and industrial’ ratepayers before setting a rate, a measure reflecting the government's concern about the impact of rates upon business costs.
In 1985/6 the selective powers were used to cap the rates of eighteen councils; in 1987/8, twenty councils were rate-capped (plus ILEA and nineteen joint boards created following the abolition of the GLC and the metropolitan county councils).
Although clear criteria for selection must be laid down (for example, expenditure 20 per cent above GREA and 4 per cent above 1984/5 target) almost all selected councils have been Labour-controlled.
Machinery does exist for selected authorities to appeal to the Secretary of State, and in 1986/7 several rate-capped councils appealed for and obtained redetermined spending levels.
This followed assurances that no authority seeking a redetermination should suffer a reduced spending level, fear of which had prevented any of the selected authorities from appealing in the first year of operation.
The Rates Act has been widely interpreted as a threat to local-government independence.
Byrne (1986, p. 299) sees it as a  constitutional change such that‘central government, in relation to local government has come to resemble the Big Brother of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four ’, while Newton and Karran (1985, ch. 8) compare it to ‘Knee-Capping Local Government’.
In the long term, they argue (p. 121)‘the constitutional issues’ outweigh ‘the disorganisation of local finances, and the breakdown of central-local relations…
The British system of government…was already highly centralised in 1979, and subsequent legislation has produced a quantum jump towards a more powerful and centralised state’.
In the past individual authorities could always escape centrally imposed financial constraints by raising extra income from the rates without penalty (so long as it was prepared to risk the ‘political’ reaction from local ratepayers).
That option, however, has now largely been closed.
Whilst the general power to cap the rates of all authorities has not yet been used, the switch in emphasis from concern with local government spending to local authority spending has nevertheless been marked.
Almost all the selected authorities (despite loud protests) set legal rates within the limits set by ministers; and councillors in Lambeth — who delayed setting a rate to try and avoid compliance-were subsequently surcharged by the district auditor and disqualified as councillors.
A similar fate befell councillors in Liverpool who, although not rate-capped at the time, delayed setting a rate on the grounds that they would otherwise have to make large spending cuts or impose rate rises (contrary to the ruling Labour group's manifesto commitments) to maintain expenditure within the block-grant regime (Parkinson, 1985; Travers, 1986, especially 164–77).
Both in Lambeth and Liverpool councillors were seeking to exploit a legal loophole — the absence of any statutory date for setting a rate-subsequently removed by the Local Government Act 1986 (which requires a legal rate to be set by 1 April).
Elsewhere councillors were seemingly unwilling to risk illegality.
Although local government generally remained firmly opposed to the principle of rate limitation, few concessions were wrung from the government, and non-compliance petered out.
Nevertheless, while the government might successfully have enacted and implemented its rate-capping proposals, this was not achieved without considerable political cost.
All the local authority associations (including those with a Conservative majority) opposed rate-capping in principle, the local government press, and the media generally were hostile, while the Bill's passage through Parliament led to strenuous opposition from senior Conservative MPs and sizeable backbench revolts in some votes.
These political costs, moreover, produced only marginal gains in terms of local government expenditure control.
The exemption from the selective scheme of authorities  spending less than GREA or 10m — a provision intended to reduce political opposition from the Conservative-dominated shire districts removed an estimated 309 of the 333 English and Welsh non-metropolitan district councils from the scheme at the outset.
Ministerial reassurances that the selective scheme would only encompass between about twelve and twenty authorities, and that the general scheme was a reserve power which ministers hoped never to use, served — although not written into the Bill — further to limit politically the scope of the measure.
The combined effect of these concessions was virtually to remove from threat of rate-capping all but about 20 (4.4 per cent) of the 456 principal local authorities then existing in England and Wales.
Clearly, so long as ministerial assurances are honoured, rate-capping can deliver only very limited reductions in total local authority expenditure.
Other constraints have also, in practice, limited the impact of rate-capping.
As Travers (1986, p. 168) notes, the government had to set rate limits high enough to prevent legal challenges that income was insufficient to meet statutory obligations.
It also had to keep the numbers of capped authorities to manageable proportions to prevent civil servants from being overloaded by the administrative burden of determining — and redetermining in the event of appeal — rate levels under the selective scheme.
There were also political complications, in so far as the government wished to avoid criteria for rate-capping which might include Conservative-controlled authorities.
(In the event one Conservative authority, Portsmouth, was rate-capped in 1985/6.)
For all these reasons the apparently draconian central powers contained in the 1984 Rates Act had a surprisingly limited effect in terms not only of the numbers of authorities rate-capped but also in terms of the capping limits actually imposed.
According to Travers (1986, pp. 164–77) many of the rate limits were ‘relatively generous’, ‘no significant inroads’ were made into the spending of selected councils and some were able even to make ‘a large rate increase’.
A number of authorities also resorted to creative accountancy — technical accounting adjustments which maximize financial benefits in the authority's favour-as a means of ‘spending above the rate-capping spending level’.
For similar reasons, even in Scotland, where the Scottish Office had power to control the rates in all authorities, ‘rate-capping produced few selective cuts in spending’(Dunleavy and Rhodes, 1988, p. 123).
Not only did rate-capping legislation have relatively little impact on spending patterns in selected authorities, it is questionable even whether overall local government spending was actually reduced.
As Dunleavy and Rhodes (1988, p. 123) observe, ‘high-spending’ authorities not rate-capped tended to increase rates in order to build reserves against possible rate-capping in the future; hence, ‘it is difficult to say whether selective rate-capping has marginally decreased total local  government taxation…or substantially increased it (by encouraging many more councils to raise (taxes) as an insurance’.
What is clear however, is that rate-capping failed to produce the curbs in local spending which the government desired and in 1987 the Department of Environment, armed with the full battery of post-1979 legislation, had to concede that English local authorities were on course to exceed government expenditure targets by at least 500m (The Times 28 October 1987).
Indeed, at almost every turn, as central government has imposed new financial controls, local authorities have discovered loopholes and managed largely to avoid the intended consequences.
Observing the statute book alone might appear to depict a massive reinforcement of the agency model of central-local financial relationships but practical outcomes are perhaps more suggestive of power-dependency.
What, of course, the failure to achieve the desired curbs in local spending did produce was an inevitable increase in the burden upon the ratepayer.
As the percentage of revenue income derived from grant fell (from 46.7 per cent in England in 1976/7 to 39.2 per cent in 1984/5) so the percentage borne by local ratepayers increased (from 23 per cent to 27 per cent).
This, in turn, focused attention upon the anomalies of the rating system (see p. 160–62) and increased pressure for the wholesale reform of local government finance.
Of course, the climate of central-local government relationships in which these reforms were unveiled was hardly propitious.
Shifting the burden from taxpayers to ratepayers, and introducing a plethora of complex and continually changing central financial controls, inevitably soured relationships even where party political and ideological differences did not intrude.
While the Thatcher government has had a major policy aim of controlling public expenditure and has used the block-grant regime and rate-capping to that end, centrally imposed financial controls not only infringe the rights of elected councillors to determine local spending needs and priorities but also undermine accountability to local ratepayers.
What from the central perspective might be seen as an instrument of public expenditure control, from the local level might be seen as a threat to the fabric of local government itself.
Consequently the ‘bitter rancour’ and ‘strident tension’which Greenwood (1982 p. 254) characterized as underlying central local government relationships has, if anything, intensified as the decade has progressed.
The local state?
On pp. 184–89 several ‘models’ of central-local relations were discussed.
There are, however, alternative approaches.
One such is provided in recent Marxist literature.
In her study of Lambeth, Cockburn (1977) provides one of the best known examples of this perspective which assumes that local government is simply one arm of the capitalist state, providing the conditions for continued capital accumulation and the maintenance of social order.
In other words, a general theory of the capitalist state is applied with little modification to what has become known as the ‘local state’.
Saunders (1981), however, suggests that this approach is inadequate.
He argues that the ‘local state’ is not simply the national state writ small, and that a general theory of the state cannot be applied to the local level.
He criticizes Cockburn's as ‘a surprisingly crass agency model’ which reduces local government to a mere agent of central government.
In Saunders's view, the ‘local state’ cannot simply be reduced to a functioning part of a national capitalist state, for within certain constraints ‘non-capitalist interests can win at the local level in a way that is becoming increasingly difficult at national level’(pp. 4, 11).
In 1983, for example, there were ‘radical’ authorities of the ‘Left’(such as the GLC), as well as of the ‘Right’(such as Wandsworth), which operated with particular local distinctiveness.
As a basis for understanding ‘the current crisis of central-local relations in Britain' (p. 10) Saunders offers an alternative analytical framework encompassing four main dimensions: organizational, economic, political, and ideological.
Each dimension can be observed from both the central and local perspective.
From the perspective of a right-wing central government these four dimensions can be seen thus:
1
the organizational problem of how to impose central controls against the demand for local self-determination, especially on the part of radical Labour councils claiming a mandate for opposing government policies;
2
the economic problem of how to enforce reductions in local social consumption expenditure;
3
the political problem of how to reconcile local democratic accountability with the pursuit of a long-term economic strategy;
4
the ideological problem of how to break down popular expectations regarding social provisions which became established during the postwar years of Keynesian consensus politics.
From the perspective of radical Labour councils (seeking to oppose Conservative central government cuts) Saunders puts forward the same four dimensions:
1
the organizational problem of how to fight central government policies through local authorities which are subordinate to central departments;
2
the economic problem of how to finance and defend services while at the same time transforming their character in a socialist direction;
3
the political problem of how to mobilize alliances among different consumption sectors and between these and class-based producer movements;
4
the ideological problem of how to assert the principle of need in the face of central government's desire to trim welfare services.
Saunders's analysis of central-local relations goes beyond the interorganizational focus of the power-dependence model.
Rightly, he stresses economic, political and ideological dimensions as well as‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’perspectives.
His approach is particularly helpful in understanding the relationship between central governments and local authorities which are opposed on political and ideological grounds.
It is less helpful, however, where there is little or no political or ideological distinctiveness — in technical fields, for example, or where there is sustained political consensus between individual authorities and the centre.
Perhaps, as Dunleavy (1980b, p. 131) suggests, future research into central-local relations needs to adopt a variety of analytical perspectives.
Organizational issues are only one dimension of inter-governmental relations.
Overview and prospects
R. Rhodes,(1984, p. 355), observing the increased assertiveness of the Thatcher government, has characterized the changes in relationship between central and local government during the 1970s as shifting from bargaining through incorporation to direction and centralization in the 1980s.
However, direction and centralization, as Dunleavy and Rhodes (1987, p. 26) warn, is not synonymous with control, as is well illustrated in the financial sphere where interventions have often been met by the development of evasion strategies by local authorities.
In practice ‘the degree of control has been limited: intentions and achievements have diverged markedly’.
Even if its intentions have not always been realized, the second half of the 1980s has nevertheless witnessed renewed determination by central government to exercise greater direction over local authorities.
The 1986 Local Government Act, for example, limited the ability of local authorities to spend money on publicity, while the 1988 Local Government Act imposed further restrictions professedly designed to stop the use of rates for party political propaganda.
The 1988 Local Government Act also sought to extend the privatization or contracting-out of local authority services by empowering the Secretary of State to specify by regulation local services which must be put out to  tender.
Services initially specified included refuse collection, cleaning buildings, street sweeping, school meals and catering, and ground and vehicle maintenance.
Under the Act the Secretary of State can differentiate between authorities in drawing up the timetable for tendering and has powers to extend tendering to other services.
First contracts are scheduled to start in April 1989.
This measure effectively makes competitive tendering compulsory for designated services, replacing the former (largely discretionary) powers which had been used by relatively few authorities in specific areas (Ascher, 1987, especially ch. 7; Stoker, 1988).
These enactments, particularly when seen alongside pledges in the Conservative Party's 1987 general election manifesto (and subsequently presented to Parliament) to allow schools and council tenants to ‘opt out’ of local authority control, would seem to envisage a diminished role for elected local government.
Indeed the abolition of the GLC and metropolitan county councils, coupled with the recent development in inner-city areas of enterprise zones, city task forces and urban development corporations, has already meant in some localities a reduced role for elected councils in local service provision.
Nevertheless, despite these trends, local government retains a substantial political and administrative role in Britain, and central-local relationships remain in a continuous state of flux.
As Shell (1987, p. 295) observes, ‘Because Britain lacks a codified constitution, the relationship between central and local government is nowhere precisely defined’.
And whilst in a formal sense local authorities are entirely subordinate to Parliament, in practice working relationships are tremendously diverse.
In 1981 Sharpe (p. 5) pointed to an ‘unresolved tension’ in central local relationships arising from the ambiguous status of local government, which is subordinate to Parliament, but at the same time ‘has the potential for independent power’through being elected and by having the capacity to raise at least some of its revenue by local taxation.
Political, economic and social priorities can vary enormously between central government and local authorities, as well as between local authorities themselves, and over time.
Interestingly, in the light of increasing central ‘controls’ during the late 1970s and the 1980s, Alexander (1982b, p. ix), in what could be interpreted as a swing back towards an agency model approach, argues that there has been a ‘decline in the autonomy and independence of local government…[which]constitutes a threat to the nature of our democracy and to the sensitivity and effectiveness of our public services’.
Clearly, however, the infinite number of variables prohibits the formulation of any ‘rule of thumb’; complexity and ambiguity remain the order of the day, hence the inappropriateness of generalizations.
11 QUASI-GOVERNMENT
Introduction
The term ‘quasi-government’ refers to both the government-created and semi-private organizations which are both distinct from, but usually relate to, either central departments or local authorities.
As a field of study quasi-government is both complex and confusing, being partly public and partly private, voluntary or commercial.
So great is the number and variety of organizations included within it that generalizations, definitions and classifications are fraught with difficulties.
Even terminology is a problem.
The organizations comprising quasi-government are referred to by a variety of terms: ‘fringe bodies’, ‘non-departmental public bodies’.
‘semi-autonomous authorities’ and ‘quangos’, to name but a few.
The latter term, usually an acronym for ‘quasi-autonomous non-governmental organization’, has now entered popular usage, indicating the interest which quasi-government has recently begun to attract.
The word ‘quango’, however, is essentially an umbrella beneath which a tremendous variety of organizations shelter.
Compare, for example, a local association for the disabled, the Apple and Pear Development Council, the UK Atomic Energy Authority, and the Arts Council of Great Britain — all are ‘quangos’ but their diversity in terms of finance, organization, objectives and accountability is enormous.
Generalizing about ‘quangos’ can be hazardous — even their origins are remarkably diverse as Barker (1982, pp. 7–8) observes:
Many are statutory, under an Act itself (for example, Manpower Services Commission or Health and Safety Commission)…
The founding instrument may be a royal charter (BBC or the research councils); a Treasury Minute (University Grants Committee); the articles of a non-profit company (National Consumer Council); or, more humbly, but apparently almost as effectively, a mere Answer in the House, a memorandum from the Minister to himself, a wave of the hand, or whatever else may signify a decision to establish a new body (Schools Council, Technician and Business Education Councils and that unusual ‘central–local government voluntary’ body, the  Women's Royal Voluntary Service).
The problem of discussing quasi-government is further complicated, as Doig (1979, p. 311) notes, ‘by the fact that there is no one characteristic, or lack of characteristic, that distinguishes quangos or non-departmental  public bodies from other organisations in the structure of government’.
Nevertheless, most, if not all, of the organizations concerned carry out their work at arm's length from central government departments and/or local authorities.
Indeed, quasi-government is sometimes presented as part of a public/private continuum: from government (G), such as central departments; through quasi-governmental organizations (QG), such as nationalized industries; to quasi-non-governmental organizations (QNG), such as the National Research Development Organization; to non-government (NG), such as private companies (see Hague, Mackenzie and Barker, 1975).
This is obviously a simplified and inevitably imprecise scheme but it is helpful in placing quasi-government within the broader administrative and political context.
While the rationale for the arm's length approach, as well as the length of the arm, varies widely from organization to organization, the desire to distance important areas of public administration from direct political control has been a major factor in the twentieth-century growth of quasi-government.
Of course, where politicians are denied control, they cannot normally be expected to assume accountability, thus undermining the principle that public administration should be publicly accountable.
As Sir Norman Chester (1979, p. 54) has observed:
The growth of fringe bodies is a retreat from the simple democratic principle evolved in the nineteenth century that those who perform a public duty should be fully responsible to an electorate — by way either of a minister responsible to Parliament or of a locally elected council.
The essence of the fringe body is that it is not so responsible for some or all of its actions.
Numbers and types of quangos
In 1987 there were, according to official figures (Cabinet Office, 1987, p. iv) some 1,643 Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) operating in Britain, spending between them 9,100m and employing 148,700 staff.
Although in 1979, when the Conservative election manifesto pledged a purge on quangos, the number had been much larger (2,167 bodies, employing 217,000 staff) quangos are clearly far from dead.
Indeed, although there were fifteen fewer quangos overall than in the previous year, the twelve months ending April 1987 still saw sixty-six new bodies set up, the Ministry of Agriculture leading the way with twenty-eight.
Nevertheless, while quangos have clearly survived the first two Thatcher administrations, a precise head count is less easy than official  figures might suggest.
Indeed there remains much disagreement about precisely (or even roughly) how many organizations exist within the field of quasi-government.
This is partly because of the difficulty in deciding where boundaries should be drawn, a difficulty which has increased in recent years with the development of new organizational forms (such as‘hived-off’ agencies) and with the increasing interpenetration of the public and private sectors.
As Hood (1979, p. 9) asks, ‘Does one include advisory committees as ‘government bodies’?
Contracting firms?
Grant-aided bodies?
Firms in which public money is invested?’
Quasi-government is a grey area between not only government departments and local authorities, but also frequently between the public and the private sectors.
Another analytical difficulty is that organizational units are often not clear-cut.
For example, it is always problematic whether or not to count Scottish and Welsh divisions of an agency as separate units or as part of a single organization.
Because of these various difficulties a count of quangos is beset with problems.
In 1978 the Civil Service Department reported that there were 252 non-departmental public bodies, compared with 196 in 1971, 103 in 1959 and only ten before 1900 (Bowen, 1978).
The definition the CSD used for its survey was: ‘organisations which have been set up or adopted by Departments and provided with funds to perform some function which the Government wish to have performed but which it did not wish to be the direct responsibility of a Minister or Department’.
The CSD survey excluded non-permanent bodies, advisory committees and working parties.
Other sources, using broader definitions, produce far higher figures.
For example, Anderson lists almost 1,000 official organizations, many of them advisory and consultative (cited in Hood, 1979, p. 8).
Philip Holland (1979) produced a list of 3,068 quangos but this was because he defined a quango as an official body to which ministers appoint directly members other than civil servants.
He thereby included hundreds of advisory committees and hundreds of judicial tribunals and many more bodies with no governmental function at all(several public schools, for example ).
The Outer Circle Policy Unit (1979a) included 603 bodies in its list, having excluded departmental advisory committees and organizations whose function was primarily Judicial.
‘Head counts’ of quangos are the more difficult because, as Hood (1979, pp. 9–10) observes, ‘the ‘heads’involved are of enormously differing size and importance — on a scale more like the difference between the head of an ant and an elephant than the difference between one human head and another'.
Quangos, in fact, are analogous to pressure groups; both involve tiny, relatively insignificant groupings, as well as massive and extremely powerful organizations.
Indeed quangos are frequently the target of pressure group activity, and may  at times themselves behave like pressure groups exerting pressure on other parts of the government machine.
The volume and variety of quangos also make any attempt at meaningful classification difficult.
However, the Pliatzky Report (1980, pp. 1–2) delineated three distinctive types — executive bodies, advisory bodies, and tribunals — which offers a useful basis for categorization.
In 1987 the Cabinet Office (1987, p. iv) identified within each of these categories the following numbers:
1
Executive bodies: 396
2
Advisory bodies: 1057
3
Tribunals: 64
The number of quangos in this classification, large though it is, nevertheless excludes important areas of quasi-government.
It ignores, for example, the ‘innumerable autonomous and semi-autonomous, official and quasi-official organizations, each with its own part to play in the policy-making process’ of local government (Cousins, 1982, p. 152).
It also excludes various administrative agencies connected with the National Health Service and the nationalized industries.
The size, diversity, and importance of quasi-government is vast; one is dealing with a genus rather than a species.
All that can really be said with certainty is that quasi-governmental bodies generally operate in narrower, more specific areas than government departments or local authorities.
Inevitably, any classification of such bodies must be arbitrary; clear boundaries between quasi-government and more orthodox areas of public administration cannot always be drawn.
For presentational purposes, however, this chapter will follow Pliatzky and focus upon the major forms of quasi-government at national level, namely,executive and advisory non-departmental public bodies .
The other major form of non-departmental body,the public corporation, will be discussed in Chapter 12 within the wider context of the nationalized industries.
Health and water authorities , while part of quasi-government, have a strong regional network, and are discussed in Chapter 13 along with other forms of regional administration.
Administrative tribunals , although included within Pliatzky's survey, are most appropriately considered alongside other channels of redress, and are therefore dealt with in detail in Chapter 15.
Space does not allow consideration of quasi-government at the local level (for details of which see Cousins, 1982 and 1983; Rhodes, 1988).
Non-departmental public bodies: rationale
Quasi-government is not new although its scale is new.
The Crown Agents, for example, date from the mid-nineteenth century, the  Development Commission was set up in 1909 and the Horserace Totalisator Board (the Tote) goes back to 1928.
As Hood notes, however, they came into ‘high fashion in the 1940s and again in the 1960s when the Fulton Committee endorsed the idea of government growth outside Whitehall by ‘hiving-off’ units from civil service departments to non-departmental bodies' (1981, p. 100).
Pliatzky (1980, pp. 2–3) presents the rationale for non-departmental bodies in the following terms.
EXECUTIVE BODIES
These include the Hops Marketing Board and the Nature Conservancy Council, for example, and are justified with the argument that certain functions can best be carried out at arm's length from central government:
(i)
because the work is of an executive nature which does not require ministers to be involved in day-to-day management;
(ii)
because the work is more effectively carried out by a single-purpose organization rather than by a government department with a wide range of functions;
(iii)
to involve people from outside government in the direction of the organization; and
(iv)
to put the performance of particular functions outside direct party political control.
ADVISORY BODIES
These include the China Clay Council and the Advisory Committee on Pesticides, for example.
The major reasons for advisory committees (incorporating outside representation) are:
(i)
that the department's own staff are unable to provide the necessary advice by themselves, and
(ii)
that it may be desirable to enlist participation by outside interests in order to develop publicly acceptable proposals.
Control and accountability
These two concepts (see Chapter 1) are central to any discussion of quasi-government:
CONTROL
The arm's length approach usually associated with quangos means that normal departmental patterns of ministerial control do not apply.
Indeed, a minister may even ‘expressly desire to keep out of the affairs of quangos within the ambit of his department, arguing that to behave otherwise is merely to frustrate the whole purpose of this way of organising public services’(Johnson, 1979, p. 389).
On day-to-day matters most ministers and departments ‘maintain an arm's-length relationship’ from the organization which they sponsor, although considerable pressure may be brought to bear upon them on ‘broader policy and resource’matters (Johnson, 1982, p. 213).
The precise way in which many quangos are controlled is difficult to determine.
Obtaining even basic information can be problematical.
For example, while annual reports usually name the chairman and board members they do not always reveal their salaries.
Likewise the breakdown of expenses between board members and staff, and between different types of expenses, is relatively detailed in some cases but not in others.
A further problem is that the governing authority of quangos often consists of a board or council.
Often the only paid member is the chairman, suggesting that he may really be in charge.
However, generalizations are dangerous: some chairmen are only part-time and some councils are large while others are small and highly specialized.
While the staff running some are technical specialists, this is far from universal.
Sometimes the relationship with the parent department is close; sometimes it is not.
The permutations are infinite.
ACCOUNTABILITY
Three aspects of the accountability of non-departmental bodies require consideration:
(i) Relations with ministers
With non-departmental bodies, as Johnson (1982, p. 213) observes, ‘accountability of Ministers’ must remain ‘attenuated’, for ‘otherwise there would be little point in having this form of administrative organisation’.
Usually ministers are formally answerable to Parliament only for discharging their own responsibilities relating to sponsored bodies (such as in terms of broad policy and general oversight), while responsibility for efficiency and day-to-day matters normally rests with the organizations' own management.
In practice, however, the precise boundaries of ministerial responsibility are often difficult to define.
Not only is the borderline between ministers' policy and oversight responsibilities, and those of boards for efficiency and day-to-day administration, often blurred, but in practice there is considerable variation in relationships between ministers and boards.
(The Public Accounts Committee (1986–7a, para. 32), for example, contrasted the Welsh Office's ‘arm's length and detached’ attitude to ‘sponsorship’of NDPBs, with the Environment Department's  ‘involved, positive and disciplined’approach).
In any event the sheer volume and variety of bodies under departmental sponsorship often makes ministerial responsibility something of a myth.
In recent years the size and complexity of departmental work has seriously eroded the concept of ministerial responsibility even for their own departments (Chapter 14).
How much more tenuous must it therefore be for non-departmental bodies operating at arm's length from ministers, and which ‘for most of the time…rub along without much awareness of the Minister and his officials’(Johnson, 1982, p. 213).
(ii) Relations with Parliament
Because non-departmental bodies operate at arm's length from government, and ministers are not constitutionally responsible to Parliament for all of their work, accountability to Parliament is limited.
Johnson (1982, p. 213) observes that MPs ‘may attempt ingeniously to get at the activities of governmental bodies through the questioning of Ministers, but…it is not something attempted very regularly and, when it is, the attack focuses on policy and resources rather than on particular decisions’.
The dilemma, he adds, is that ‘reinforcement of the parliamentary accountability of these organisations would also entail a strengthening of ministerial control over them’, so destroying the arm's length relationship with all its attendant advantages.
Nevertheless, some important instruments of accountability to Parliament can be identified, although most apply to some quangos and not all.
For example, some come within the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman (Chapter 15), some have their accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and reported to the Public Accounts Committee (Chapter 14), some present annual reports to Parliament, and so on .
In fact, no general pattern is discernible, except that almost all stop short of full accountability to Parliament.
In 1979, however accountability was strengthened with the advent of the fourteen new Commons select committees, each of which has power to examine the expenditure, administration and policy of the main government departments ‘and associated public bodies’.
While this represents an important development in Parliament's powers of scrutiny, non-departmental bodies account for only a small part of the work of these committees which are quite unable to exercise anything like detailed oversight.
(iii) Relations with the courts
The legal accountability of quangos also poses considerable difficulty.
Because their legal status and powers are confused, judicial control of their activities lacks coherence.
For example, remedies available against one body may not be available against another; procedures or standards  applied by one quango may be legally sound but if utilized by another they may not, and so on .
In Johnson's view (1982, p. 215), ‘The confusions affecting legal accountability and the availability of enforceable remedies are one of the most serious aspects of the haphazard development of governmental bodies’.
While accountability problems are found throughout British public administration, with non-departmental bodies they are particularly acute.
Clearly, orthodox ministerial responsibility could not be extended to them without undermining the arm's length principle.
Several changes short of this, however, have been proposed: requiring greater disclosure of information; extending jurisdiction of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Public Accounts Committee to more bodies; and clarifying the authority, powers and legal status of all such organizations (see, for example, Outer Circle Policy Unit, 1979a; and Pliatzky Report, 1980, pp. 18–23).
Changes of this kind would standardize and strengthen accountability without destroying the arm's length arrangement.
In view of the importance and extent of quasi-government they perhaps deserve serious consideration.
In 1981 a tentative move in this direction occurred with the publication of a government guide (Non-Departmental Public Bodies: A Guide for Departments ) laying down ground rules on the future nature of quangos and their relationships with departments.
A revised edition of this document was produced in 1985 (Cabinet Office (MPO) /Treasury, 1985c) which reflected developments in policy and practice since the 1981 edition, particularly the government's drive to strengthen financial management.
Departments are now obliged to review from time to time the bodies they sponsor, and have received instructions that — whatever the precise degree of independence — the minister is answerable to Parliament for whether the body is working efficiently and economically.
They have also since 1984 been brought within the framework of the Financial Management Initiative (see Chapter 7; Cabinet Office (MPO) /Treasury (FMU), 1984a).
Greater financial accountability, particularly for bodies utilizing government funds at a level of 50 per cent or more, was also envisaged and the establishment of new non-departmental bodies would, it was promised, involve negotiating more hurdles than hitherto.
Not surprisingly, the financial position of fringe bodies is almost infinitely varied.
Some are funded by grants-in-aid (such as the Training Agency); some by statutory levy (such as the Horserace Betting Levy Board); some by annual grant (such as the Health Education Council); some by departmental vote (such as the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work); some by drawing on the National Loan Fund (such as New Town Corporations); and some by charges for services (such as the Agricultural Marketing Boards)(Rhodes, 1988, p. 129).
In each of these financial relationships  the government has considerable power.
Despite the diversity, therefore, central direction is marked.
Patronage
Considerable concern about non-departmental bodies has focused on patronage — the number of appointments in the gift of ministers.
Promotion by merit rather than political influence has long characterized the British civil service, but outside the civil service ministers still exercise considerable patronage.
In November 1978, for example, ‘seventeen ministers had within their gift over 8,000 paid appointments and 25,000 unpaid ones at a total cost of 5m. a year’(Outer Circle Policy Unit, 1979a, p. 47).
One department alone was responsible for nearly 1,000 appointments.
Parliamentary influence over these appointments is minimal, the matter being almost entirely one of ministerial discretion.
Party political factors are frequently to the fore; indeed, ‘many people…have claimed to perceive a resurgence of eighteenth-century jobbery’(Hood, 1978, p. 40).
Whether or not patronage is used in a party political manner, the non-departmental sector nevertheless ‘affords the opportunity for government by co-option rather than by election or by merit appointment’(Hood, 1978, p. 41).
Additionally, once a person is appointed, not only need the minister never account for the choice, but the likelihood is that he or she will never have to justify it on performance grounds.
The Outer Circle Policy Unit study (1979a, p. 48) emphasized three major areas for concern about appointments of this kind:
(i)
efficiency — does patronage result in the best available people being appointed?
(ii)
power — does patronage give ministers too much power to influence supposedly independent organizations?
(iii)
privilege — does it enable elite groups to dominate patronage jobs?
Although these are legitimate grounds for unease, solutions are far from straightforward because of the diversity of quangos.
Some appointments could be on a representative basis where there are sectional interests, but in other cases the wider public interest would need to be safeguarded.
Holland and Fallon (1978, p. 25) argue that several reforms are necessary
(i)
nomination should be much more open, with ministers more accountable to Parliament for each appointment;
(ii)
the number of paid public appointments that can be held by a single individual should be limited;
(iii)
all full-time paid appointments should be advertised and the appointment confirmed by a relevant parliamentary committee;
(iv)
appointments on solely political grounds should cease.
In summary, any reforms to the system of ministerial patronage should aim to reduce secrecy, encourage competition, control the power of ministers, introduce accountability for appointments made, and provide for assessment of performance.
It is important, however, not to underplay the political dimension of patronage; it offers a means of securing the co-operation of key pressure groups and ensuring party discipline-hence ministerial ‘resistance’ to drastic pruning.
Exit non-departmental public bodies?
The Conservative government elected in 1979 promised a drastic purge of quasi-governmental organizations as part of its wider strategy of reducing public expenditure.
Immediately following the 1980 Pliatzky Report the government decided to reduce: a) the number of executive bodies by thirty; b) the number of advisory bodies by 211; c) the number of individual tribunals by six.
In December 1980 the government announced that a further 192 non-departmental bodies were to be wound up by 1983, bringing the total savings up to about 23m a year by 1983.
In February 1982 the Prime Minister announced a third round of cuts: the abolition of 112 executive non-departmental bodies and 500 advisory ones.
Philip Holland, MP, observed: ‘That nearly one-quarter of the executive quangos and nearly one-third of the very large number of advisory bodies, as defined by Pliatzky and inherited by this Government, are scheduled for abolition after only 2½ years is a quite remarkable achievement by any standards’(Daily Telegraph, 11 March 1982).
By November 1984 the Prime Minister reported that 700 bodies had either been wound up or had their expenditure reduced, giving a total saving of 118m per year (see Hood, 1988, p. 89 for further elaboration on alleged reductions).
However, as Table 11.1 shows, spending on fringe bodies still remains high.
In 1986–7, for example, a single executive body, the Manpower Services Commission, spent 3,129.1m (see Cabinet Office, 1987, p. 14).
Why has the promised purge of quangos proved so difficult to achieve?
According to Rhodes (1988, p. 130) one main reason is that the Thatcher government has developed quangos as a convenient vehicle for bypassing what it perceived (particularly in urban areas) as a hostile and recalcitrant local government system.
Quangos have provided a   means of developing an administrative network at grass roots level without the uncertainty (and possible political hostility) associated with provision by elected local authorities.
At the local level recent years have seen considerable central intervention via ‘fringe’ agencies.
As Dunleavy and Rhodes (1987, p. 23) argue, the government ‘has presided over the proliferation of single-function quasi-government agencies’.
Recent years have seen the establishment of ‘enterprise zones’, Urban Development Corporations and a range of similar organizations, operating at local level but bypassing inner-city councils.
Non-Departmental Public Bodies 1979–87
In similar vein the abolition of the metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council in 1986 also ‘produced a whole new crop of non-departmental bodies’(Dunleavy and Rhodes, 1987, p. 23).
(A precursor was the London Regional Transport Board established in 1984, when London Transport was removed from the GLC.)
The new bodies created to provide services in the former GLC and metropolitan county areas include numerous joint boards of councillors or QUELGOs (quasi-elected local government organizations).
Consisting mainly of councillors indirectly elected by district councils in the locality such bodies are now responsible in these areas for fire, waste disposal services, and many other functions.
In London responsibility for around two-thirds of GLC spending, and in the former metropolitan county areas about half, was transferred to non-departmental bodies or central departments (Dunleavy and Rhodes, 1987, p. 23).
Non-departmental public bodies are far from dead!
Quangos, clearly, have been advantageous to government in allowing  elected local authorities to be bypassed (and in some cases even replaced altogether).
Indeed it is possible, at the time of writing, to foresee major expansion of quango-type bodies for similar reasons at national level.
The ‘agencies’ proposed in the Ibbs Next Steps Report (see Chapter 2), for example, are seen as an alternative to government departments for the delivery of a wide range of executive functions in line with the Thatcher government's emphasis on ‘value for money’.
Significantly, they seem likely to bear many of the problems (such as accountability) already associated with non-departmental public bodies, as well as many of the hallmarks: the delegation of functions to specialist agencies, broad policy determined by government; and an arm's length relationship with departments.
How far these proposals will reach fruition remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: as Hood (1981, pp. 120–1) argues, non-departmental bodies are too useful for politicians to abolish them too readily.
There are, he adds, at least four potential political uses which make them unlikely to disappear:
(i)
government will presumably always need bodies from which it can distance itself in sensitive areas;
(ii)
there will presumably always be value in having temporary organizations outside the permanent government service that can be scrapped when chances permit;
(iii)
the use of such bodies as an administrative means of bypassing other public organizations, along with the patronage dimension, continues to attract politicians;(iv) advisory committees are useful as political ‘window dressing’.
For these reasons, if for no others, quangos seem unlikely to become extinct.
Conclusions
Non-departmental public bodies have, for the most part, restricted authority, a limited arsenal of political resources, and a lack of independent finance.
They do, however, have organizational and informational resources aplenty (Rhodes, 1988, p. 171).
Although essentially concerned with adapting centrally determined policy to local circumstances, and interfacing with relevant consumers, the professional expertise embedded in such bodies nevertheless provides opportunities to shape decision-making in some areas of public policy.
Non-departmental public bodies have arisen to no pattern or plan.
They display a variety of structures, powers, modes of finance, methods of selection, degrees of discretion and types of staff.
The main problems they pose are the excessive patronage they confer on the  politicians and officials who establish them and make appointments to them, ‘their frustration of the implementation of public policies, their financial irresponsibility and their erosion of democratic accountability and control’(Jones, 1982a, p. 924).
Jones further argues that if central government believes it cannot or should not perform a particular public function, ‘it would be better if it decentralised not to technocratic quangos but to directly elected local governments’.
Less radically, Johnson (1979, pp. 393–4) argues that some order could be introduced into chaos by the creation of a Standing Advisory Commission on Administrative Organization (another quango?).
This would conduct a continuing survey of administrative structures with two purposes in mind: a) to produce information and thereby increase openness; b) to carry out inquiries and offer advice to central government and other public authorities.
Whatever the merits of such reform proposals it is a mistake to see quangos as wholly self-contained.
As Hood (1979, p. 20) points out, government agencies are increasingly operating ‘in multiple and dense networks of cross-cutting territorial, functional and hierarchical relationships, and within an overall context of…government by grants and by indirect administration rather than by the older pattern of directly hired bureaucrats at the centre’.
Inter-organizational and inter-agency relationships have become increasingly complex; quangos (with their organizational and informational resources) are only part of this complex administrative and political environment — an environment which the operations of quangos themselves influence (see Moore and Booth, 1987).
In recent years the discrediting of quangos has become a popular political pastime.
According to Dunsire (1982, p. 15), ‘quango-hunting’ has since 1979 ‘become a Conservative blood-sport, under the illusion that they are nothing but wasteful ‘empire-building’'.
In practice, however, quangos often deal with specialized tasks in a way which both central government departments and local authorities would find difficult.
They are also incredibly diverse; there is little justification for derogatory generalizations.
Without denying the accountability/ control/patronage problems which accompany this form of governmental organization, the survival of the species suggests that governments themselves see a continuing role for non-departmental public bodies, particularly when faced with politically hostile local authorities and bureaucratically organized government departments which may frustrate central government policy priorities.
As Hill (1983, p. 124) observes, the ‘attacks on Quangos have obscured, rather than illuminated, the serious issue of how ministerial patronage might be replaced by alternative selection procedures, and how these bodies might be made more accountable, without losing that very semi-independence which was a major reason for establishing them in the first place’.

THE MOUNTAIN
Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Tock.
Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Tock.
It sounded like a clock gently misfiring, time entering a delirium.
This might have been appropriate, the Colonel reflected, but it wasn't the case.
It was important to stick to what you knew, right to the end, especially at the end.
He knew it wasn't the case.
It wasn't time, it wasn't even a distant clock.
Colonel Fergusson lay in the cold square bedroom of his cold square house three miles outside Dublin and listened to the clicking overhead.
It was one o'clock in the morning on a windless November night of 1837.
His daughter Amanda sat at his bedside in stiff, pout-lipped profile, reading some piece of religious mumbo-jumbo.
At her elbow the candle burned with a steady flame, which was more than that perspiring fool of a doctor with letters after his name had been able to say about the Colonel's heart.
It was a provocation, that's what it was, thought the Colonel.
Here he was on his deathbed, preparing for oblivion, and she sits over there reading Parson Noah's latest pamphlet.
Actively disagreeing right to the end.
Colonel Fergusson had long since given up trying to understand the business.
How could the child he loved most have failed to inherit either his instincts or the opinions he had with such difficulty acquired?
It was vexing.
If he hadn't adored her he would have treated her as a credulous imbecile.
And still, despite it all, despite this living, fleshly rebuttal, he believed in the world's ability to progress, in man's ascent, in the defeat of superstition.
It was all finally very puzzling.
Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Tock.
The clicking continued overhead.
Four, five loud ticks, a silence, then a fainter echo.
The Colonel  could tell that the noise was distracting Amanda from her pamphlet, though she gave no outward sign.
It was simply that he could judge such things after living so closely with her for however many years.
He could tell she hadn't really got her nose in the Reverend Abraham.
And it was her fault that he could tell, that he knew her so thoroughly.
He'd told her to go off and get married when that lieutenant whose name he could never recall had asked her.
She'd argued about that, too.
She'd said she loved her father more than her uniformed claimant.
He'd replied that this wasn't a sound reason, and anyway he'd only die on her.
She'd wept and said he wasn't to talk like that.
But he'd been right, hadn't he?
He was bound to be, wasn't he?
Amanda Fergusson now rested her book on her lap and looked at the ceiling in alarm.
The beetle was a harbinger.
Everyone knew that its sound portended the death of someone in the house within the year.
It was the wisdom of ages.
She looked across to see if her father was still awake.
Colonel Fergusson had his eyes closed and was breathing out through his nose in long smooth puffs like a bellows.
But Amanda knew him well enough to suspect that he might be bluffing.
It would be just like him.
He had always played tricks on her.
Like that time he'd taken her to Dublin, one blustery day in February of 1821.
Amanda was seventeen, and everywhere carried with her a sketching book as she now carried her religious pamphlets.
She had lately been excited by reports of the exhibition at Bullock's Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London, of Monsieur Jerricault's Great Picture, 24 feet long by 18 feet high, representing the Surviving Crew of the Medusa French Frigate on the Raft.
Admission 1s, Description 6d, and 50,000 spectators had paid to see this new masterpiece of foreign art, shown alongside such permanent displays as Mr Bullock's magnificent collection of 25,000 fossils and his Pantherion of stuffed wild beasts.
Now the canvas had come to Dublin, where it was put on view at the Rotunda: Admission 1s 8d, Description 5d.
Amanda had been chosen above her five siblings by reason of her precocity with water-colour — at least, this was Colonel  Fergusson's official excuse for indulging his natural preference once again .
Except that they did not go, as promised, to the Rotunda, but went instead to a rival attraction advertised in Saunder's News-Letter & Daily Advertiser : one, indeed, which ensured that Monsieur Jerricault's Great Picture did not triumph in Dublin as it had done in London.
Colonel Fergusson took his daughter to the Pavilion, where they witnessed Messrs Marshall's Marine Peristrephic Panorama of the Wreck of the Medusa French Frigate and the Fatal Raft: Admission front seats 1s 8d, back seats 10d, children in the front seats at half price.
‘The Pavilion is always rendered perfectly comfortable by patent stoves’.
Whereas the Rotunda displayed a mere twenty-four feet by eighteen of stationary pigment, here they were offered some 10,000 square feet of mobile canvas.
Before their eyes an immense picture, or series of pictures, gradually unwound: not just one scene, but the entire history of the shipwreck passed before them.
Episode succeeded episode, while coloured lights played upon the unreeling fabric, and an orchestra emphasized the drama of events.
The audience was constantly moved to applause by the spectacle, and Colonel Fergusson would nudge his daughter heavily at some particularly felicitous aspect of the display.
In the sixth scene those poor French wretches on the raft were represented in very much the same posture as that in which they had been first delineated by Monsieur Jerricault.
But how much grander, Colonel Fergusson observed, to picture their tragic plight with movement and coloured lights, accompanied by music which he identified quite unnecessarily to his daughter as ‘Vive Henrico!’
‘That is the way forward,’ remarked the Colonel with enthusiasm as they left the Pavilion.
‘Those painters will have to look to their brushes.’
Amanda did not reply, but the following week she returned to Dublin with one of her five siblings and this time visited the Rotunda.
There she greatly admired Monsieur Jerricault's canvas, which though static contained for her much motion and lighting and, in its own way, music — indeed, in some fashion it  contained more of these things than did the vulgar Panorama.
Upon her return she told her father as much.
Colonel Fergusson nodded indulgently at such pertness and obstinacy, but held his peace.
On the 5th of March, however, he jauntily indicated to his favourite daughter a fresh advertisement in Saunder's New's-Letter announcing that Mr Bullock had reduced — had clearly been obliged to reduce, the Colonel interpreted — the price of admission into his immobile spectacle to a mere ten pence.
At the end of that month Colonel Fergusson imparted the news that the Frenchy picture at the Rotunda had closed for lack of spectators, whereas Messrs Marshall's Peristrephic Panorama was still being shown three times a day to audiences rendered perfectly comfortable by patent stoves.
‘It is the way forward,’ the Colonel repeated in June of that year, after attending by himself the farewell performance at the Pavilion.
‘Mere novelty is no proof of value,’ his daughter had replied, sounding a little too smug for one so young.
Tick, tick, tick, tick.
Tock.
Colonel Fergusson's faked sleep became more choleric.
God damn it, he was thinking, this dying business is difficult.
They just won't let you get on with it, not on your own terms, anyway.
You have to die on other people's terms, and that's a bore, love them as you might.
He opened his eyes and prepared to correct his daughter for the several hundredth occasion in their lives together.
‘It's love,’ he said suddenly.
‘That's all it is.’
Amanda's gaze was surprised from the ceiling, and she looked across with brimming eyes.
‘It's the love-call of xestobium rufo-villosum , for God's sake, girl.
Simple as that.
Put one of the little fellows in a box and tap on the table with a pencil and he behaves in exactly the same way.
Thinks you're a female and butts his head against the box trying to get to you.
Speaking of which, why didn't you marry that lieutenant when I told you to?
Sheer damn insubordination.’
He reached across and took her hand.
But his daughter didn't reply, her eyes continued to overflow, the ticking carried on overhead, and Colonel Fergusson  was duly buried before the year's end.
On this prediction the doctor and the death-watch beetle had managed to agree.
Amanda's grief for her father was compounded by anxiety over his ontological status.
Did his obstinate refusal to acknowledge the divine plan — and his careless use of the Almighty's name even on his deathbed — mean that he was now consigned to outer darkness, to some chilly region unheated by patent stoves?
Miss Fergusson knew the Lord to be just, yet merciful.
Those who accepted his commandments were to be judged in punctilious accordance with the law, whereas the ignorant savage in the darkened jungle who could not possibly have known the light would be treated with gentleness and given a second chance.
But did the category of ignorant savage extend to occupants of cold square houses outside Dublin?
Was the pain which unbelievers bore all their lives at the prospect of oblivion to be extended into further pain inflicted for having denied the Lord?
Miss Fergusson feared that it might be.
How could her father have failed to recognize God, His eternal design, and its essential goodness?
The proof of this plan and of this benevolence lay manifest in Nature, which was provided by God for Man's enjoyment.
This did not mean, as some had assumed, that Man might recklessly pillage Nature for what he sought; indeed, Nature was deserving of the more respect because it was a divine creation.
But God had created both Man and Nature, placing Man into that Nature as a hand is placed into a glove.
Amanda frequently reflected upon the fruits of the field, how various they were, and yet how perfectly each was adapted for Man's enjoyment.
For instance, trees bearing edible fruits were made easy to climb, being much lower than forest trees.
Fruits which were soft when ripe, such as the apricot, the fig or the mulberry, which might be bruised by falling, presented themselves at a small distance from the ground; whereas hard fruit, which ran no risk of sustaining an injury by a fall, like the cocoa, the walnut or the chestnut, presented themselves at a considerable height.
Some fruit — like the cherry and the plum — were moulded for the mouth; others — the apple and the pear — for the hand; others still, like the  melon, were made larger, so as to be divided among the family circle.
Yet others, like the pumpkin, were made of a size to be shared amongst the whole neighbourhood, and many of these larger fruits were marked on their outer rind with vertical divisions, so as to make apportionment the easier.
Where Amanda discovered in the world divine intent, benevolent order and rigorous justice, her father had seen only chaos, hazard and malice.
Yet they were both examining the same world.
In the course of their many arguments, Amanda once asked him to consider the domestic condition of the Fergusson family, who lived together with strong bonds of affection, and declare whether they too were the consequence of chaos, hazard and malice.
Colonel Fergusson, who could not quite bear to inform his daughter that the human family sprang from the same impulse which animated a beetle striking its head against the walls of its box, replied that in his view the Fergussons were a happy accident.
His daughter replied that there were too many happy accidents in the world for them to be accidental.
In part, Amanda reflected, it was a matter of how you perceived things.
Her father saw in a vulgar simulacrum of coloured lights and trilling music a true portrayal of a great maritime tragedy; whereas for her the reality was best conveyed by a simple, static canvas adorned with pigment.
Mainly, however, it was a question of faith.
A few weeks after their visit to the Peristrephic Panorama, her father was rowing her slowly across the serpentine lake on the neighbouring estate of Lord F-.
Some connection having been made in his mind, he began to rebuke her for a belief in the reality of Noah's Ark, which he referred to sarcastically as the Myth of the Deluge.
Amanda was not discountenanced by the accusation.
She replied by asking her father if he believed in the reality of Mr Bullock's Pantherion of stuffed wild beasts at his Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, London.
The Colonel, taken aback, responded that naturally he did; whereupon his daughter exhibited a humorous astonishment.
She believed in the reality of something ordained by God and described in a book of Holy Scripture read and  remembered for thousands of years; whereas he believed in the reality of something described in the pages of Saunder's News-Letter & daily Advertiser , which people were unlikely to remember the very next morning.
Which of them, she insisted upon knowing, with a continuing and unnecessary mockery in her eye, was the more credulous?
It was in the autumn of 1839, after long meditation, that Amanda Fergusson proposed to Miss Logan the expedition to Arghuri.
Miss Logan was a vigorous and seemingly practical woman some ten years older than Miss Fergusson, and had been fond of the Colonel without any zephyr of indiscretion arising.
More to the point, she had travelled to Italy a few years previously while in the employment of Sir Charles B.
‘I regret that I am unacquainted with the place,’ replied Miss Logan when first interviewed.
‘Is it far beyond Naples?’
‘It is on the lower slopes of Mount Ararat,’ Miss Fergusson responded.
‘The name Arghuri is derived from two Armenian words signifying he planted the vine .
It is where Noah returned to his agricultural labours after the Flood.
An ancient vine stock planted by the Patriarch's own hands still flourishes.’
Miss Logan concealed her astonishment at this curious lecture, but felt bound to enquire further.
‘And why might we be going there?’
‘To intercede for the soul of my father.
There is a monastery upon the mountain.’
‘It is a long way to go.’
‘I believe it to be appropriate.’
‘I see.’
Miss Logan was pensive at first, but then brightened.
‘And shall we drink the wine there?’
She was remembering her travels in Italy.
‘It is forbidden,’ replied Miss Fergusson.
‘Tradition forbids it.’
‘Tradition?’
‘Heaven, then.
Heaven has forbidden it, in memory of the fault into which the grapes betrayed the Patriarch.’
Miss Logan, who would complaisantly allow the Bible to be read to her but was not diligent in turning the pages herself, exhibited  a momentary confusion.
‘Drunkenness,’ explained Miss Fergusson.
‘Noah's drunkenness.’
‘Of course.’
‘The monks of Arghuri are permitted to eat the grapes, but not to ferment them.’
‘I see.’
‘There is also an ancient willow tree, sprung from one of the planks of Noah's Ark, which grows there.’
‘I see.’
And thus it was agreed.
They would depart in the spring, to avoid the malarial menace of the later seasons.
Each would require a portable bedstead, an air mattress and a pillow; they would take some Oxley's essence of ginger, some good opium, quinine and  Seidlitz powders; a portable inkstand, a match-box and supply of German tinder; umbrellas against the sun and flannel belts to ward off cramps of the stomach during the night.
After some discussion they decided not to travel with either a portable bath or a patent coffee-machine.
But they counted as necessary a pair of iron-pointed walking sticks, a clasp-knife, stout hunting-whips to beat off the legions of dogs they were prepared to encounter, and a policeman's small lantern, since they had been warned that Turkish paper lanterns were useless in a hurricane.
They took mackintoshes and heavy greatcoats, anticipating that Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's dream of perennial sunshine was unlikely to be fulfilled for lesser voyagers.
Miss Logan understood gunpowder to be the most acceptable offering for the Turkish peasant, and writing-paper for the superior classes.
A common box-compass, she had further been advised, would afford pleasure by directing the Mussulman to the point of his prayers; but Miss Fergusson was disinclined to assist the heathen in his false adorations.
Finally, the ladies packed two small glass bottles, which they intended to fill with grape juice crushed from the fruit of Noah's vineyard.
They travelled by Government steam-packet from Falmouth to Marseilles, thereafter entrusting themselves to the French conveyances.
In early May they were received by the British Ambassador in Constantinople.
As Miss Fergusson explained  the extent and purpose of their journey, the diplomat studied her: a dark-haired woman in early middle age, with protuberant black eyes and rather full, reddish cheeks which pushed her lips forward into a pout.
Yet she was in no wise a flirt: her natural expression appeared to mix prudishness with certainty, a combination which left the Ambassador indifferent.
He grasped most of what she was saying without ever quite bestowing upon her his full attention.
‘Ah,’ he said at the finish, ‘there was a rumour a few years ago that some Russo had managed to get to the top of the mountain.’
‘Parrot,’ replied Miss Fergusson without a smile.
‘Not a Russo, I think.
Dr Friedrich Parrot.
Professor in the University of Dorpat.’
The Ambassador gave a diagonal nod of the head, as if it were slightly impertinent to know more than he did about local matters.
‘It seems to me appropriate and just,’ went on Miss Fergusson, ‘that the first traveller to ascend the mountain upon which the Ark rested should bear the name of an animal.
No doubt part of the Lord's great design for us all.’
‘No doubt,’ replied the Ambassador, looking away to Miss Logan for some clue as to the personality of her employer.
‘No doubt.’
They remained a week in the Ottoman capital, by no means long enough for Miss Logan to become accustomed to the coarse stares she received at the table d'hôte .
Then the two ladies gave themselves up to the Favaid-i-Osmaniyeh, a Turkish company running steamers to Trebizond.
The accommodation was crowded and to Miss Logan's mind far filthier than anything she had previously encountered.
She ventured upon deck the first morning, and was approached by not one but three potential beaux, each with his hair curled and exuding a powerful odour of bergamot.
Thereafter Miss Logan, despite having been engaged for her experience, confined herself to the cabin.
Miss Fergusson professed not to notice such inconveniences and to be positively intrigued by the scrum of third-class passengers  on board; she would occasionally return with an observation or a question designed to stir Miss Logan from her dismal state of mind.
Why, her employer wished to know, were the Turkish women all accommodated on the left-hand side of the quarter-deck?
Was there some purpose, be it of society or of religion, behind such positioning?
Miss Logan was unable to furnish a reply.
Now that they had left Naples way behind them she felt increasingly less secure.
At the faintest whiff of bergamot she shuddered.
When Miss Logan had permitted herself to become engaged for the voyage to Asiatic Turkey, she had under-estimated Miss Fergusson's pertinacity.
The absconding muleteer, the swindling innkeeper and the devious customs-house officer were all treated to the same display of unthwartable will.
Miss Logan lost count of the times their luggage was detained, or they were told that a buyurulda or special permit would be necessary in addition to the tezkare they had already procured; but Miss Fergusson, with assistance from a dragoman whose own brief display of independent thought had been snuffed out early on, harried, demanded and succeeded.
She was tirelessly willing to discuss things in the manner of the country; to sit down with a landlord, for example, and answer such questions as whether England was smaller than London, and which of the two belonged to France, and how much larger the Turkish navy was than those of England, France and Russia put together.
Miss Logan had further imagined that their journey, while devotional in its final purpose, might afford pleasant opportunities for sketching, the activity which had first established a bond between employer and companion.
But antiquities held no charm for Amanda Fergusson; she had no desire to examine heathen temples to Augustus, or half-surviving columns supposedly erected in honour of the apostate Emperor Julian.
At least she evinced an interest in the natural landscape.
As they rode inland from Trebizond, hunting-whips at the ready against the expected dog-packs, they viewed mohair goats on hillsides of dwarf oak, dull yellow vines, lush apple orchards; they heard  grasshoppers whose ringing note seemed sharper and more insistent than that of their British cousins; and they witnessed sunsets of the rarest purple and rose.
There were fields of corn, opium and cotton; bursts of rhododendron and yellow azalea; red-legged partridge, hoopoes and blue crows.
In the Zirgana mountains large red deer softly returned their gaze from an apprehensive distance.
At Erzerum Miss Logan prevailed upon her employer to visit the Christian church.
The impulse proved at first a happy one, for in the graveyard Miss Fergusson discovered tombstones and crosses whose Celtic air recalled those of her native Ireland; a smile of approval crossed her dutiful features.
But this unexpected lenity was short-lived.
Leaving the church, the two ladies noticed a young peasant woman placing a votive offering in a crevice by the main door.
It proved to be a human tooth, no doubt her own.
The crevice, upon further examination, was found to be stuffed full of yellowing incisors and weathered molars.
Miss Fergusson expressed herself forcibly on the subject of popular superstition and the responsibility of the clergy.
Those who preached the word of God, she maintained, should be judged according to the word of God, and punished the more severely if found wanting.
They crossed into Russia, engaging at the frontier post a new guide, a large and bearded Kurd who claimed familiarity with the requirements of foreigners.
Miss Fergusson addressed him in what seemed to Miss Logan a mixture of Russo and Turk.
The days when Miss Logan's fluent Italian had been of use to them were long past; having begun the journey as guide and interpreter, she felt she had dwindled into a mere hanger-on, with little greater status than the discarded dragoman or the newly-appointed Kurd.
As the three of them proceeded into Caucasia, they disturbed flocks of pelican, whose earthbound ungainliness was miraculously transfigured by flight.
Miss Fergusson's irritation over the incident in Erzerum began to calm.
Passing the eastern spur of Mount Alageuz, they gazed intently as the broad bulk of Great Ararat slowly revealed itself.
The summit was hidden, enfolded in a circle of white cloud which glittered brilliantly in the sun.
‘It has a halo,’ exclaimed Miss Logan.
‘Like an angel.’
‘You are correct,’ Miss Fergusson replied, with a little nod.
‘People like my father would not agree, of course.
They would tell us that such comparisons are all hot air.
Literally.’
She gave a pursed smile and Miss Logan, with an enquiring glance, invited her to continue.
‘They would explain that the halo of cloud is a perfectly natural phenomenon.
During the night and for several hours after dawn the summit remains clearly visible, but as the plain warms up in the morning sun, the hot air rises and becomes vapour at a given height.
At the day's end, when everything cools down again, the halo disappears.
It comes as no surprise to…science,’ she said with a disapproving emphasis upon the final word.
‘It is a magic mountain,’ commented Miss Logan.
Her employer corrected her.
‘It is a holy mountain.’
She gave an impatient sigh.
‘There always appear to be two explanations of everything.
That is why we have been given free will, in order that we may choose the correct one.
My father failed to comprehend that his explanations were based as much upon faith as mine.
Faith in nothing.
It would be all vapour and clouds and rising air to him.
But who created the vapour, who created the clouds?
Who ensured that Noah's mountain of all mountains would be blessed each day with a halo of cloud?’
‘Exactly,’ said Miss Logan, not entirely in agreement.
That day they encountered an Armenian priest who informed them that the mountain towards which they were heading had never been ascended and, moreover, never would be.
When Miss Fergusson politely suggested the name of Dr Parrot, the priest assured her that she was mistaken.
Perhaps she was confusing Massis — as he referred to Great Ararat — with the volcano far to the south which the Turks called Sippan Dagh.
The Ark of Noah, before it found its final resting-place, had struck the summit of Sippan Dagh and removed its cap, thereby exposing the inner fires of the earth.
That mountain, he understood, was accessible to man, but not Massis.
On this  subject, if on nothing else, Christian and Mussulman agreed.
And furthermore, went on the priest, was it not so proven by Holy Scripture?
The mountain before them was the birthplace of mankind; and he referred the ladies, while excusing himself with an ingratiating laugh for mentioning an indelicate subject, to the authority of Our Saviour's words to Nicodemus, where it is stated that a man cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born once more.
As they were parting, the priest drew from his pocket a small black amulet, worn smooth over many centuries.
It was, he claimed, a piece of bitumen which assuredly had once formed part of the hull of Noah's Ark, and had great value in the averting of mischief.
Since the ladies had expressed such interest in the mountain of Massis, then perhaps…
Miss Fergusson courteously responded to the suggested transaction by pointing out that if indeed it was impossible to ascend the mountain, then the likelihood of their believing that the amulet could be a piece of bitumen from the Patriarch's vessel was not very great.
The Armenian, however, saw no incompatibility between his two propositions.
Perhaps a bird had carried it down, as the dove had borne the olive branch.
Or it might have been brought by an angel.
Did not tradition relate how Saint James had three times attempted to ascend Massis, and on the third occasion been told by an angel that it was forbidden, but that the angel had given him a plank of wood from the Ark, and there where he had received it was founded the monastery of Saint James?
They parted without a bargain being struck.
Miss Logan, embarrassed by Our Lord's words to Nicodemus, was instead thinking about bitumen: was that not the material used by artists to blacken the shadows in their paintings?
Miss Fergusson, on the other hand, had merely been put into a temper: first by the attempt to thrust some foolish meaning on to the scriptural verse; and secondly by the priest's brazen commercial behaviour.
She had yet to be impressed by the Eastern clergy, who not only countenanced belief in the miraculous powers of human teeth, but actually traded in bogus religious relics.
It  was monstrous.
They should be punished for it.
No doubt they would be.
Miss Logan examined her employer apprehensively.
The next day they crossed a relentless plain of reeds and coarse grass, relieved only by colonies of bustard and the black tents of Kurdish tribesmen.
They stopped for the night in a small village a day's ride from the foot of the mountain.
After a meal of cream cheese and salted salmon trout from the Gokchai, the two women stood in the dark air scented with apricot and looked towards the mountain of Noah.
The range before them contained two separate crescendi: Great Ararat, a bulky, broad-shouldered mass like a buttressed dome, and Little Ararat, some four thousand feet lower, an elegant cone with smooth and regular sides.
Miss Fergusson did not think it fanciful to perceive in the comparative design and height of the two Ararats a bodying-forth of that primal divide in the human race between the two sexes.
She did not communicate this reflection to Miss Logan, who had so far proved dismally unreceptive to the transcendental.
as if to confirm her pedestrian turn of mind, Miss Logan at this point revealed that it had been a matter of curiosity to her since childhood how the Ark had succeeded in resting upon the top of a mountain.
Had the peak risen up from the waters and punctured the keel, thereby skewering the vessel in place?
For if not, how otherwise had the Ark avoided a precipitous descent as the waters had retreated?
‘Others before you have had similar reflections,’ replied Miss Fergusson with distinct lack of indulgence.
‘Marco Polo insisted that the mountain was made in the shape of a cube, which would certainly have explained the matter.
My father would probably have agreed with him, had he given the subject his attention.
But we can see that this is not the case.
Those who have ascended to the peak of Great Ararat inform us that close below the summit there is a gently sloping valley.
It is’, she specified, as if Miss Logan could not otherwise understand the matter, ‘approximately half the size of Green Park in London.
As a place of disembarkation it would be both natural and safe.’
‘So the Ark did not land on the very summit?’
‘Scripture makes no such claim.’
As they approached Arghuri, which lay at a height of more than six thousand feet above sea level, the temperature of the air became more genial.
Three miles below the village they came upon the first of the hallowed plantations of Father Noah.
The vines had just finished flowering, and tiny dark green grapes hung intermittently among the foliage.
A peasant put down his rough hoe and conducted the unexpected party to the village elder, who received their offering of gunpowder with formal thanks yet little surprise.
Miss Logan was sometimes irked by such civility.
The elder was behaving as if parties of white women were constantly presenting him with gunpowder.
Miss Fergusson, however, remained her dutiful and efficient self.
It was arranged that later in the afternoon they would be conducted to the Monastery of Saint James; they would be lodged that night in the village, and would return again to the church the following day for their devotions.
The monastery lay beside the Arghuri rivulet in the lower part of a great chasm which extended almost to the very summit of the mountain.
It consisted of a cruciform church whose stone was hewn from hardened lava.
Various small dwellings pressed against its sides like the farrow of a sow.
As the party entered the courtyard a middle-aged priest stood waiting for them, the cupola of Saint James rising behind him.
He was dressed in a plain gown of blue serge, with a pointed Capuchin cowl; his beard was long, its blackness intertwined with grey; on his feet he wore woollen Persian socks and common slippers.
One hand bore the rosary; the other was folded across his chest in a gesture of welcome.
Something urged Miss Logan to kneel before the pastor of Noah's church; but the presence and certain disapproval of Miss Fergusson, who dismissed as ‘Romish’ a large category of religious behaviour, prevented her.
The courtyard spoke less of a monastery than a farm.
Sacks of corn were piled loosely against a wall; three sheep had wandered in from the nearby pasture and had not been expelled; there was a rank smell from underfoot.
Smiling, the Archimandrite invited them to his cell, which proved to be one of the tiny  dwellings built hard against the outer wall of the church.
As he was conducting them across the dozen or so yards, the Archimandrite appeared to touch Miss Fergusson's elbow by way of courteous but strictly unnecessary guidance.
The monk's cell had stout clay walls and a plaster roof supported by a sturdy central prop.
There was a rough icon of some unidentifiable saint hanging above a straw pallet; the courtyard odours continued here.
To Miss Logan it seemed admirably simple, to Miss Fergusson squalid.
The behaviour of the Archimandrite also provoked differing interpretations: Miss Logan discerned an amiable candour where Miss Fergusson saw only sly obsequiousness.
It seemed to Miss Logan that her employer had perhaps exhausted her stock of civility on the long journey to Mount Ararat, and had now retreated into a stony carelessness.
When the Archimandrite suggested that the two ladies might like to lodge at the monastery that night, she was briefly dismissive; when he pressed his offer of hospitality further, she was brusque.
The Archimandrite continued to smile, and his mood still appeared to Miss Logan a gracious one.
At this point a servant appeared bearing a rough tray on which were set three horn beakers.
Water from the Arghuri brook, thought Miss Logan; or perhaps that sourish milk which they had already received many times on their travels from obliging shepherds.
But the servant returned with a wineskin, and at a signal poured a liquor from it into the horn vessels.
The Archimandrite raised his beaker towards the women, and drank fully; whereupon his servant poured for him again.
Miss Fergusson sipped.
Then she put questions to the Archimandrite which provoked a severe apprehension in Miss Logan.
This feeling was exacerbated by waiting for the guide to translate.
‘This is wine?’
‘Indeed.’
The priest smiled, as if encouraging the women to indulge in this local taste which was still clearly unknown in their distant land.
‘It is made from grapes?’
‘You are correct, lady.’
‘Tell me, the grapes from which this wine has been made, where are they grown?’
The Archimandrite spread both hands and circled to indicate the neighbouring countryside.
‘And the vines from which the grapes were plucked, who first planted them?’
‘Our great ancestor and forefather, parent of us all, Noah.’
Miss Fergusson summed up the exchange so far, needless as this seemed to her companion.
‘You are serving us the fermented grapes from Noah's vines?’
‘It is my honour, Madam.’
He smiled again.
He seemed to expect if not especial thanks, at least some expression of wonder.
Instead, Miss Fergusson stood up, took the untasted wine from Miss Logan, and returned both beakers to the servant.
Without a word she left the Archimandrite's cell, swept from the courtyard in a manner which made three sheep instinctively follow her, and started down the mountainside.
Miss Logan made indeterminate gestures to the priest, then set off in pursuit of her employer.
They traversed lush apricot orchards without comment; they ignored a shepherd holding out a bowl of milk; wordlessly they returned to the village where Miss Fergusson, her calculated civility now restored to her, asked the elder if lodgings could be supplied to them without delay.
The old man proposed his own house, the largest in Arghuri.
Miss Fergusson thanked him, and offered in return a small parcel of sugar, which was gravely accepted.
That evening in their room a low table no bigger than a music stool was set with food.
They were given losh , the thin local bread, cold mutton cut in pieces, hard-boiled eggs taken from their shells and halved, and the fruit of the arbutus.
They were served no wine, either because such was the custom of the house, or because intelligence of their visit to the monastery had reached the elder.
Instead, they drank sheep's milk once more.
‘It is a blasphemy,’ said Miss Fergusson eventually.
‘A blasphemy.
On Noah's mountain.
He lives like a farmer.
He  invites women to stay with him.
He ferments the grape of the Patriarch.
It is a blasphemy.’
Miss Logan knew better than to reply, let alone plead the cause of the amiable Archimandrite.
She recalled to herself that the circumstances of their visit had deprived them of an opportunity to examine the ancient willow tree sprung from a plank of Noah's Ark.
‘We shall ascend the mountain,’ said Miss Fergusson.
‘But we do not know how to do such a thing.’
‘We shall ascend the mountain.
Sin must be purged with water.
The sin of the world was purged by the waters of the flood.
It is a double blasphemy that the monk commits.
We shall fill our bottles with snow from the holy mountain.
The pure juice of Noah's vine we came in search of has been rendered impure.
We shall bring back purging water instead.
That is the only way to salvage the journey.’
Miss Logan nodded, in startled acquiescence rather than agreement.
They set off from the village of Arghuri on the morning of June 20th, in the year of Our Lord 1840, accompanied only by their Kurdish guide.
The elder regretfully explained the villagers' belief that the mountain was sacred, and that no-one should venture upon it higher than the Monastery of Saint James.
He himself shared these beliefs.
He did not try to dissuade the party from their ascent, but he did insist on loaning Miss Fergusson a pistol.
This she displayed at her belt, though she had neither the intention nor the resource to use it.
Miss Logan carried a small bag of lemons, which had also been advised.
The ladies rode with white umbrellas raised against the morning sun.
Looking upwards, Miss Fergusson observed the halo of cloud beginning to form itself around the summit of the mountain.
A daily miracle, she noted to herself.
For several hours they appeared to make little progress; they were traversing a barren region of fine sand and yellowish clay, broken only by a few stunted, prickly bushes.
Miss Logan observed several butterflies and numerous lizards, but was  secretly disappointed that so few of the creatures which had descended from the Ark were manifesting themselves.
She had, she admitted to herself, foolishly pictured the slopes of the mountain as a kind of zoological garden.
But the animals had been told to go forth and multiply.
They must have obeyed.
They dipped into rocky ravines, none of which contained the smallest stream.
It seemed an arid mountain, as dry as a chalk down in Sussex.
Then, a little higher, it surprised them, suddenly unveiling green pasture and rose bushes with delicate pink blossom.
They rounded a spur and came upon a small encampment — three or four rude tents, with matting walls and black roofs made from goats' hair.
Miss Logan was slightly alarmed by the sudden presence of this group of nomads, whose flock could be seen lower down the slope, but Miss Fergusson directed her horse straight towards them.
A ferocious-looking man whose tangled hair resembled the roof of his own tent held up to them a rough bowl.
It contained sourish milk mixed with water, and Miss Logan drank somewhat nervously.
They nodded, smiled, and continued on their way.
‘Did you judge that a natural gesture of hospitality?’ asked Amanda Fergusson suddenly.
Miss Logan considered this strange question.
‘Yes,’ she responded, for they had previously come across many similar instances of such behaviour.
‘My father would have said it was merely an animal bribe to turn away the wrath of strangers.
It would be an article of faith with him to believe that.
He would have said those nomads were just like beetles.’
‘Like beetles?’
‘My father was interested in beetles.
He told me that if you put one in a box and tapped on the lid, it would knock back, thinking you were another beetle offering itself in marriage.’
‘I do not consider that they were behaving like beetles,’ said Miss Logan, while carefully indicating by her tone that this was only her private opinion and in no way derogatory of Colonel Fergusson.
‘Nor do I.’
Miss Logan did not fully understand her employer's condition of mind.
Having come this great distance to intercede for her father, she now seemed instead to be constantly arguing with his shade.
At the first steep slope of Great Ararat they tethered their horses to a thorn tree and hobbled them.
They were to proceed from here on foot.
Miss Fergusson, umbrella aloft and pistol at her belt led the way with the certain tread of the righteous; Miss Logan, dangling her bag of lemons, struggled to keep up as the terrain grew more precipitous; their Kurdish guide, weighed down with baggage, brought up the rear.
They would be obliged to spend two nights on the mountain if they were to reach the snowline.
They had climbed hard all afternoon, and shortly before seven o'clock, with the sky softening towards apricot, were resting on a rocky outcrop.
At first they did not identify the noise, or what it signified.
They were aware of a low rumble, a granite growl, though whence it came, whether from above or below them, was not evident.
Then the ground beneath their feet began to vibrate, and there came a noise like thunder — but internal, suppressed, terrifying thunder, the sound of a primeval, subterranean god raging against his confinement.
Miss Logan glanced fearfully at her employer.
Amanda Fergusson was directing her field-glasses at the Monastery of Saint James, and her face bore an expression of prim pleasure which shocked her companion.
Miss Logan was near-sighted, and consequently it was from Miss Fergusson's features rather than from personal observation that she grasped what was happening.
When the field-glasses were finally passed to her she was able to confirm that every roof and every wall of the monastery church and of the little community they had left only that morning had been thrown down by the violent commotion.
Miss Fergusson got to her feet and briskly began to continue the ascent.
‘Are we not to help the survivors?’ asked Miss Logan in perplexity.
‘There will not be any,’ replied her employer.
Adding in a  sharper tone, ‘It was a punishment they should have foreseen.’
‘A punishment?’
‘For disobedience.
For fermenting the fruit of Noah's vine.
For building a church and then blaspheming within it.’
Miss Logan looked at Amanda Fergusson cautiously, unsure how to express the view that to her humble and ignorant mind the punishment seemed excessive.
‘This is a holy mountain,’ said Miss Fergusson coldly.
‘The mountain upon which Noah's Ark rested.
A small sin is a great sin in this place.’
Miss Logan did not break her alarmed silence; she merely followed her employer who was pushing on ahead up a gully of rock.
At the top Miss Fergusson waited and then turned to her.
‘You expect God to be like the Lord Chief Justice in London.
You expect a whole speech of explanation.
The God of this mountain is the God who saved only Noah and his family out of the whole world.
Remember that.’
Miss Logan grew seriously perturbed at these observations.
Was Miss Fergusson comparing the earthquake which had thrown down the village of Arghuri to the great Flood itself?
Was she likening the salvation of two white women and a Kurd to that of Noah's family?
When preparing for their expedition they had been told that the magnetic compass was useless on such mountains as these, for the rocks were loaded with iron.
It seemed evident that you could lose your bearing here in other ways as well.
What was she doing on Noah's mountain alongside a pilgrim turned fanatic and a bearded peasant with whom she could not communicate, while the rock below them exploded like the gunpowder they had brought to ingratiate themselves with the local chieftains?
Everything urged them to go down, yet they were continuing upwards.
The Kurd, whom she had expected to flee at the first shaking of the ground, was staying with them.
Perhaps he intended to slit their throats while they slept.
They rested that night and continued climbing as soon as the sun rose.
Their white umbrellas stood out vividly against the harsh terrain of the mountain.
Here was only bare rock and  gravel; nothing grew but lichen; all was utterly dry.
They might have been upon the surface of the moon.
They climbed until they reached the first pocket of snow, which lay in a long, dark slash on the mountain's side.
They were three thousand feet from the peak, just below a cornice of ice which encircled Great Ararat.
It was here that the rising air from the plain turned to vapour and formed the miraculous halo.
The sky above them was beginning to turn a brightish green, scarcely blue at all any more.
Miss Logan felt very cold.
The two bottles were filled with snow and entrusted to the guide.
Later, Miss Logan would try picturing to herself her employer's curious serenity of face and confidence of carriage as they started down the mountain; she exhibited contentment bordering on smugness.
They had travelled no more than a few hundred yards — the Kurd leading, Miss Logan bringing up the rear — and were crossing a patch of rough scree, a descent more tiring than dangerous, when Miss Fergusson fell.
She pitched forwards and sideways, sliding a dozen yards down the slope before the Kurd was able to arrest her progress.
Miss Logan halted, initially in surprise, for it appeared that Miss Fergusson had lost her footing on a little stretch of solid rock which should have afforded no peril.
She was smiling when they reached her, apparently unconcerned by the blood.
Miss Logan would not allow the Kurd to bandage Miss Fergusson; she accepted pieces of his shirt for the purpose, but then insisted that he turn his back.
After half an hour or so, the two of them restored their employer to her feet, and they set off again, Miss Fergusson leaning on the guide's arm with a strange nonchalance, as if she were being conducted round a cathedral or a zoological garden.
They made only a short distance in the remainder of that day, for Miss Fergusson demanded frequent rests.
Miss Logan calculated how far away their horses were tethered, and was not encouraged.
Towards nightfall they came upon a pair of small caves, which Miss Fergusson compared to the pressing of God's thumb into the mountainside.
The Kurd entered the first of them cautiously, sniffing for wild beasts, then beckoned them  in.
Miss Logan prepared the bedding and administered some opium; the guide, after making gestures incomprehensible to her, vanished.
He returned an hour later with a few stunted bushes he had managed to prise from the rock.
He made a fire; Miss Fergusson lay down, took some water, and slept.
When she awoke she pronounced herself feeble, and said her bones were stiff in her skin.
She had neither strength nor hunger.
They waited through that day in the cave, trusting that Miss Fergusson's condition would improve by the next morning.
Miss Logan began to reflect upon the changes in her employer since they had arrived on the mountain.
Their purpose in coming here had been to intercede for the soul of Colonel Fergusson.
Yet so far they had not prayed; Amanda Fergusson appeared still to be arguing with her father; while the God she had taken to proclaiming did not sound the kind of God who would lightly forgive the Colonel's obstinate sinning against the light.
Had Miss Fergusson realized, or at least decided, that her father's soul was lost, cast out, condemned?
Is that what had happened?
As evening fell, Miss Fergusson told her companion to leave the cave while she spoke to the guide.
This seemed unnecessary, for Miss Logan had not a word of Turk or Russo or Kurdish or whatever mixture it was the other two communicated in; but she did as she was told.
She stood outside looking up at a creamy moon, fearful lest some bat might fly into her hair.
‘You are to move me so that I may see the moon.’
They lifted her gently, as if she were an old lady, and placed her nearer the mouth of the cave.
‘You are to set off at first light tomorrow.
Whether you return or not is immaterial.’
Miss Logan nodded.
She did not argue because she knew she would not win; she did not weep because she knew she would be rebuked.
‘I shall remember the Holy Scripture and wait for God's will.
On this mountain God's will is quite manifest.
I cannot imagine a happier place from which to be taken unto Him.’
Miss Logan and the Kurd took turns watching over her that night.
The moon, now almost full, illuminated the floor of the cave where Amanda Fergusson lay.
‘My father would have  wanted music with it,’ she said at one point.
Miss Logan smiled an agreement which irritated her employer.
‘You cannot possibly know to what I am referring.’
Miss Logan immediately agreed a second time.
There was a silence.
The dry cold air was scented with woodsmoke.
‘He thought pictures should move.
With lights and music and patent stoves.
He thought that was the future.’
Miss Logan, little better informed than before, considered it safest not to respond.
‘But it was not the future.
Look at the moon.
The moon does not require music and coloured lights.’
Miss Logan did win one small, final argument — by forceful gesture rather than words — and Miss Fergusson was left with both bottles of molten snow.
She also accepted a couple of lemons.
At daybreak Miss Logan, now wearing the pistol at her belt, set off down the mountain with the guide.
She felt resolved in spirit but uncertain how best to proceed.
She imagined, for instance, that if the inhabitants of Arghuri had been unwilling to venture on to the mountain before the earthquake, any survivors would scarcely be ready to do so now.
She might be compelled to seek help in a more distant village.
The horses were gone.
The Kurd made a long noise in his throat which she presumed to indicate disappointment.
The tree to which they had been tethered was still there, but the horses had disappeared.
Miss Logan imagined them panicking as the ground raged beneath them, tearing themselves free and violently bearing away their hobbles as they fled from the mountain.
Later, as she trudged behind the Kurd towards the village of Arghuri, Miss Logan envisaged an alternative explanation: the horses being stolen by those hospitable nomads encountered that first morning.
The Monastery of Saint James had been quite destroyed, and they passed it without halting.
As they neared the ruins of Arghuri, the Kurd indicated that Miss Logan was to wait for him while he investigated the village.
Twenty minutes later he returned, shaking his head in a universal gesture.
As they skirted the wrecked houses, Miss Logan could not help observing to herself that the earthquake had killed all the inhabitants  while leaving intact those vines which — if Miss Fergusson should be believed — were the very source of their temptation and their punishment.
It took them two days before they reached human habitation.
In a hill village to the south-west, the guide delivered her to the house of an Armenian priest who spoke passable French.
She explained the need to raise an immediate rescue party and return to Great Ararat.
The priest replied that no doubt the Kurd was organizing the relief at that very moment.
Something in his demeanour indicated that perhaps he did not quite believe her story of having climbed most of the way up Massis, which peasants and holy men alike knew to be inaccessible.
She waited all day for the Kurd to return, but he failed to do so; and when she made enquiries the next morning she was told that he had left the town within minutes of conducting her to the priest's house.
Miss Logan was angry and distressed at such Judas-like behaviour, and expressed herself forcibly on the subject to the Armenian priest, who nodded and offered to say prayers for Miss Fergusson.
Miss Logan accepted, while wondering about the efficacy of mere unadorned prayer in a region where people yielded up their teeth as votive offerings.
Only several weeks later, as she lay stifling in her cabin on a filthy steamer from Trebizond, did she reflect that the Kurd, in the whole time he had been with them, had executed Miss Fergusson's commands with punctiliousness and honour; further, that she had no means of knowing what had passed between the two of them that last night in the cave.
Perhaps Miss Fergusson had instructed the guide to lead her companion to a place of safety, and then desert.
Miss Logan also reflected upon Miss Fergusson's fall.
They had been crossing a scree; there had been many loose stones, and footing was difficult, but surely at that point they had been traversing a gentler slope, and her employer had actually been standing on a flattish stretch of granite when she had fallen.
It was a magnetic mountain where a compass did not work, and it was easy to lose your bearing.
No, that was not it.
The question she was avoiding was whether Miss Fergusson might not have  been the instrument of her own precipitation, in order to achieve or confirm whatever it was she wanted to achieve or confirm.
Miss Fergusson had maintained, when they first stood before the haloed mountain, that there were two explanations of everything, that each required the exercise of faith, and that we had been given free will in order that we might choose between them.
This dilemma was to preoccupy Miss Logan for years to come.
THREE SIMPLE STORIES
I
I WAS A NORMAL eighteen-year-old: shuttered, self-conscious, untravelled and sneering; violently educated, socially crass, emotionally blurting.
At least, all the other eighteen-year-olds I knew were like this, so I presumed it was normal.
I was waiting to go up to university and had just got a job as a prep-school master.
The fiction I had read predicted gaudy roles for me — as private tutor at the old stone mansion where peacocks roost in the yew hedges and chalky bones are discovered in the sealed-up priest's hole; as gullible ingénu at an eccentric private establishment on the Welsh borders stuffed with robust drunkards and covert lechers.
There would be careless girls and  unimpressible butlers.
You know the social moral of the story: the meritocrat becomes infected with snobbery.
Reality proved more local.
I taught for a term at a crammer half a mile from my home, and instead of passing lazy days with charming children whose actively hatted mothers would smile, condescend and yet flirt during some endless pollen-spattered sports day, I spent my time with the son of the local bookmaker (he lent me his bike: I crashed it) and the daughter of the suburb's solicitor.
Yet half a mile is a fine distance to the untravelled; and at eighteen the smallest gradations of middle-class society thrill and daunt.
The school came with a family attached; the family lived in a house.
Everything here was different and therefore better: the stiff-backed brass taps, the cut of the banister, the genuine oil paintings (we had a genuine oil painting too, but not as genuine as that), the library which somehow was more than just a roomful of books, the furniture old enough to have woodworm in it, and the casual acceptance  of inherited things.
In the hall hung the amputated blade of an oar: inscribed in gold lettering on its black scoop were the names of a college eight, each of whom had been awarded such a trophy in sun-ridden pre-war days; the item seemed impossibly exotic.
There was an air-raid shelter in the front garden which at home would have provoked embarrassment and been subjected to vigorous camouflage with hardy perennials; here it evoked no more than amused pride.
The family matched the house.
The father was a spy; the mother had been an actress; the son wore tab collars and double-breasted waistcoats.
Need I say more?
Had I read enough French novels at the time, I would have known what to expect; and of course it was here that I fell in love for the first time.
But that is another story, or at least another chapter.
It was the grandfather who had founded the school, and he still lived on the premises.
Although in his mid-eighties, he had only recently been written out of the curriculum by some crafty predecessor of mine.
He was occasionally to be seen wandering through the house in his cream linen jacket, college tie — Gonville and Caius, you were meant to know — and flat cap (in our house a flat cap would have been common; here it was posh and probably indicated that you used to go beagling).
He was searching for ‘his class’, which he never found, and talked about ‘the laboratory’, which was no more than a back kitchen with a bunsen burner and running water.
On warm afternoons he would sit outside the front door with a Roberts portable radio (the all-wood construction, I learned, gave better sound quality than the plastic or metal bodies of the transistors I admired), listening to the cricket commentary.
His name was Lawrence Beesley.
Apart from my great-grandfather, he was the oldest man I had ever met.
His age and status induced in me the normal mixture of deference, fear and cheek.
His decrepitude — the historically stained clothes, that dangle of egg-white slobber from the chin — set off in me a general adolescent anger against life and its inevitable valedictory condition; a feeling which smoothly translated itself into hatred of the person undergoing  that condition.
His daughter fed him on tins of baby food, which again confirmed for me the sour joke of existence and the particular contemptibility of this old man.
I used to tell him invented cricket scores.
‘84 for 2, Mr Beesley,’ I would shout as I passed him snoozing in the sun beneath the gangling wisteria.
‘West Indies 790 for 3 declared,’ I would insist as I delivered him his child's dinner on a tray.
I would tell him scores from matches that were not being played, scores from matches that could never have been played, fanciful scores, impossible scores.
He would nod in reply, and I would creep away, sniggering at my tiny cruelty, pleased that I was not quite such a nice young man as he might have imagined.
Fifty-two years before I met him, Lawrence Beesley had been a second-class passenger on the maiden voyage of the Titanic .
He was thirty-five, had recently given up his job as science master at Dulwich College, and was crossing the Atlantic — according to subsequent family legend, at least— in half-hearted pursuit of an American heiress.
When the Titanic struck its iceberg, Beesley escaped in the underpopulated Lifeboat 13, and was picked up by the Carpathia .
Among the souvenirs this octogenarian survivor kept in his room was a blanket embroidered with the name of the rescuing ship.
The more sceptical members of his family maintained that the blanket had acquired its lettering at a date considerably later than 1912.
They also amused themselves with the speculation that their ancestor had escaped from the Titanic in women's clothing.
Was it not the case that Beesley's name had been omitted from the initial list of those saved, and actually included among the drowned in the final casualty bulletin?
Surely this was solid confirmation of the hypothesis that the false corpse turned mystery survivor had taken to petticoats and a high voice until safely landed in New York, where he surreptitiously discarded his drag in a subway toilet?
I supported this theory with pleasure, because it confirmed my view of the world.
In the autumn of that year I was to wedge into the mirror of my college bedsitting-room a piece of paper bearing the following lines: ‘Life's a cheat and all things shew  it/I thought so once and now I know it’.
Beesley's case offered corroboration: the hero of the Titanic was a blanket-forger and transvestite imposter; how just and appropriate, therefore, that I fed him false cricket scores.
And on a wider scale, theorists maintained that life amounted to the survival of the fittest: did not the Beesley hypothesis prove that the ‘fittest’ were merely the most cunning?
The heroes, the solid men of yeoman virtue, the good breeding stock, even the captain (especially the captain!)— they all went down nobly with the ship; whereas the cowards, the panickers, the deceivers found reasons for skulking in a lifeboat.
Was this not deft proof of how the human gene-pool was constantly deteriorating, how bad blood drove out good?
Lawrence Beesley made no mention of female dress in his book The Loss of the Titanic .
Installed at a Boston residential club by the American publishers Houghton Mifflin, he wrote the account in six weeks; it came out less than three months after the sinking it describes, and has been reprinted at intervals ever since.
It made Beesley one of the best-known survivors of the disaster, and for fifty years — right up to the time I met him — he was regularly consulted by maritime historians, film researchers, journalists, souvenir hunters, bores, conspiracy theorists and vexatious litigants.
When other ships were sunk by icebergs he would be telephoned by newsmen eager for him to imagine the fate of the victims.
Forty or so years after his escape he was engaged as a consultant on the film A Night to Remember , made at Pinewood.
Much of the movie was shot after dark, with a half-size replica of the vessel poised to sink into a sea of ruckled black velvet.
Beesley watched the action with his daughter on several successive evenings, and what follows is based upon the account she gave to me.
Beesley was — not surprisingly — intrigued by the reborn and once-again-teetering Titanic .
In particular, he was keen to be among the extras who despairingly crowded the rail as the ship went down — keen, you could say, to undergo in fiction an alternative version of history.
The film's director was equally determined that this consultant who lacked the necessary  card from the actors' union should not appear on celluloid.
Beesley, adept in any emergency, counterfeited the pass required to let him board the facsimile Titanic , dressed himself in period costume (can echoes prove the truth of the thing being echoed?) and installed himself among the extras.
The film lights were turned on and the crowd briefed about their imminent deaths in the ruckled black velvet.
Right at the last minute, as the cameras were due to roll, the director spotted that Beesley had managed to insinuate himself to the ship's rail; picking up his megaphone, he instructed the amateur imposter kindly to disembark.
And so, for the second time in his life, Lawrence Beesley found himself leaving the Titanic just before it was due to go down.
Being a violently-educated eighteen-year-old, I was familiar with Marx's elaboration of Hegel: history repeats itself, the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.
But I had yet to come across an illustration of this process.
Years later I have still to discover a better one.

WHAT WAS JONAH doing inside the whale in the first place?
It's a fishy story, as you might expect.
It all began when God instructed Jonah to go and preach against Nineveh, a place which, despite God's substantial record of annihilating wicked cities, was still — obstinately, unaccountably — a wicked city.
Jonah, disliking the task for unexplained reasons which might have had something to do with a fear of being stoned to death by the partying Ninevites, ran away.
At Joppa he embarked on a boat to the farthest end of the known world: Tarshish, in Spain.
He failed to understand, of course, that the Lord knew exactly where he was, and what's more had operative control over the winds and waters of the  Eastern Mediterranean.
When a storm of rare violence blew up the mariners, being superstitious folk, cast lots to determine which of those on board was the cause of the evil, and the short straw, broken domino or queen of spades was drawn by Jonah.
He was promptly pitched overboard and just as promptly swallowed by a great fish or whale which the Lord had directed through the waters for this especial purpose.
Inside the whale, for three days and three nights, Jonah prayed to the Lord and swore his future obedience so convincingly that God ordered the fish to vomit up the penitent.
Not surprisingly, the next time the Almighty posted him to Nineveh, Jonah did as he was told.
He went and denounced the wicked city, saying that like all other wicked cities of the Eastern Mediterranean it was about to be annihilated.
Whereupon the partying Ninevites, just like Jonah inside the whale, repented; whereupon God decided after all to spare the city; whereupon Jonah became incredibly irritated, which was only normal in one who'd been put to a lot of trouble to bring the message of destruction, only for the Lord, despite a well-known, indeed historic taste for wrecking cities, to turn round and change his mind.
as if this wasn't enough, God, tireless to prove himself top dog, now pulled a fancy parable on his minion.
First he made a gourd spring up to protect Jonah from the sun (by ‘gourd’ we are to understand something like the castor-oil plant or Palma Christi , with its rapid growth and all-sheltering leaves); then, with no more than a wave of the silk handkerchief, he sent a maggot to destroy the said gourd, leaving Jonah painfully exposed to the heat.
God's explanation of this little piece of street theatre ran as follows: you didn't punish the gourd when it failed you, did you; and in the same way I'm not going to punish Nineveh.
It's not much of a story, is it?
As in most of the Old Testament, there's a crippling lack of free will around — or even the illusion of free will.
God holds all the cards and wins all the tricks.
The only uncertainty is how the Lord is going to play it this time: start with the two of trumps and lead up to the ace, start with the ace and run down to the two, or mix them around.
And since you never can tell with paranoid schizophrenics, this element does give the narrative some drive.
But what do we make of that gourd business?
It's not very convincing as a logical argument: anyone can see there's a world of difference between a castor-oil plant and a city of 120,000 people.
Unless, of course, this is the whole point, and the God of the Eastern Mediterranean values his creation no higher than vegetable matter.
If we examine God not as protagonist and moral bully but as author of this story, we have to mark him down for plot, motivation, suspense and characterisation.
Yet in his routine and fairly repellent morality there is one sensational stroke of melodrama — the business with the whale.
Technically, the cetacean side of things isn't at all well handled: the beast is evidently as much of a pawn as Jonah; its providential appearance just as the sailors are tossing Jonah overboard smacks far too heavily of a deus ex machina ; and the great fish is casually dismissed from the story the moment its narrative function has been fulfilled.
Even the gourd comes off better than the poor whale, who is no more than a floating prison where Jonah spends three days purging his contempt of court.
God finger-flips the blubbery jail hither and thither like a war-game admiral nudging his fleet across maps of the sea.
And yet, despite all this, the whale steals it.
We forget the allegorical point of the story (Babylon engulfing disobedient Israel), we don't much care whether or not Nineveh was saved, or what happened to the regurgitated penitent; but we remember the whale.
Giotto shows him chomping on Jonah's thighs, with only the knees and the flailing feet to go.
Brueghel, Michelangelo, Correggio, Rubens and Dali emblazoned the tale.
In Gouda there is a stained-glass window of Jonah leaving the fish's mouth like a foot-passenger stepping from the jaws of a car-ferry.
Jonah (portrayed as everything from muscular faun to bearded elder) has an iconography whose pedigree and variety would make Noah envious.
What is it about Jonah's escapade that transfixes us?
Is it the moment of swallowing, the oscillation between danger and salvation, when we imagine ourselves miraculously rescued  from the peril of drowning only to be cast into the peril of being eaten alive?
Is it the three days and three nights in the whale's belly, that image of enclosure, smothering, live burial?
(Once, taking the night train from London to Paris, I found myself in the locked sleeping compartment of a locked coach in a locked hold beneath the waterline on a cross-channel ferry; I didn't think of Jonah at the time, but perhaps my panic was related to his.
And is a more textbook fear involved: does the image of pulsing blubber set off some terror of being transported back to the womb?)
Or are we most struck by the third element in the story, the deliverance, the proof that there is salvation and justice after our purgatorial incarceration?
Like Jonah, we are all storm-tossed by the seas of life, undergo apparent death and certain burial, but then attain a blinding resurrection as the car-ferry doors swing open and we are delivered back into the light and into a recognition of God's love.
Is this why the myth swims through our memory?
Perhaps: or perhaps not at all.
When the film Jaws came out, there were many attempts to explain its hold over the audience.
Did it draw on some primal metaphor, some archetypal dream known the world over?
Did it exploit the clashing elements of land and water, feeding on our anxiety at the concept of amphibianism?
Did it relate in some way to the fact that millions of years ago our gill-bearing ancestors crawled out of the pond, and ever since we have been paralysed by the thought of a return to it?
The English novelist Kingsley Amis, considering the film and its possible interpretations, came to the following conclusion: ‘It's about being bloody frightened of being eaten by a bloody great shark.’
At bottom, this is the grip which the story of Jonah and the whale still has on us: fear of being devoured by a large creature, fear of being chomped, slurped, gargled, washed down with a draught of salt water and a school of anchovies as a chaser; fear of being blinded, darkened, suffocated, drowned, hooded with blubber; fear of sensory deprivation which we know drives people mad; fear of being dead.
Our response is as vivid as that of every other death-dreading generation since the tale was first  invented by some sadistic mariner keen to terrify the new cabin-boy.
Of course, we recognize that the story can't have any basis in truth.
We are sophisticated people, and we can tell the difference between reality and myth.
A whale might swallow a man, yes, we can allow that as plausible; but once inside he could not possibly live.
For a start he would drown, or if he didn't drown he would suffocate; and most probably he would have died of a heart attack when he felt the great mouth gape for him.
No, it is impossible for a man to survive in a whale's belly.
We know how to distinguish myth from reality.
We are sophisticated people.
On 25th August 1891, James Bartley, a thirty-five-year-old sailor on the Star of the East , was swallowed by a sperm whale off the Falkland Islands:
I remember very well from the moment that I fell from the boat and felt my feet strike some soft substance.
I looked up and saw a big-ribbed canopy of light pink and white descending over me, and the next moment I felt myself drawn downward, feet first, and I realised that I was being swallowed by a whale.
I was drawn lower and lower; a wall of flesh surrounded me and hemmed me in on every side, yet the pressure was not painful and the flesh easily gave way like soft india-rubber before my slightest movement.
Suddenly I found myself in a sack much larger than my body, but completely dark.
I felt about me; and my hands came in contact with several fishes, some of which seemed to be still alive, for they squirmed in my fingers, and slipped back to my feet.
Soon I felt a great pain in my head and my breathing became more and more difficult.
At the same time I felt a terrible heat; it seemed to consume me, growing hotter and hotter.
My eyes became coals of fire in my head, and I believed every moment that I was condemned to perish in the belly of a whale.
It tormented me beyond all endurance, while at the same time the awful silence of the terrible prison weighed me down.
I tried to rise, to move my arms and legs, to cry out.
All action was now impossible, but  my brain seemed abnormally clear; and with a full comprehension of my awful fate, I finally lost all consciousness.
The whale was later killed and taken alongside the Star of the East , whose crewmen, unaware of the proximity of their lost comrade, spent the rest of the day and part of the night flensing their capture.
The next morning they attached lifting tackle to the stomach and hauled it on deck.
There seemed to be a light, spasmodic movement from within.
The sailors, expecting a large fish or perhaps a shark, slit open the paunch and discovered James Bartley: unconscious, his face, neck and hands bleached white by the gastric fluids, but still alive.
For two weeks he was in a  delirious condition, then began to recover.
In due course he was returned to normal health, except that the acids had removed all the pigmentation from his exposed skin.
He remained an albino until the day he died.
M. de Parville, scientific editor of the Journal des Débats , examined the case in 1914 and concluded that the account given by captain and crew was ‘worthy of belief’.
Modern scientists tell us that Bartley could not have survived more than a few minutes in the whale's belly, let alone the half-day or more it took the unwitting sailors on the mother ship to release this modern Jonah.
But do we believe modern scientists, none of whom has actually been inside a whale's belly?
Surely we can make compromise with professional scepticism by suggesting air pockets (do whales suffer from wind like everyone else?) or stomach juices whose efficacy was hindered by some cetacean ailment.
And if you are a scientist, or infected by gastric doubt, look at it this way.
Many people (including me) believe the myth of Bartley, just as millions have believed the myth of Jonah.
You may not credit it, but what has happened is that the story has been retold, adjusted, updated; it has shuffled nearer.
For Jonah now read Bartley.
And one day there will be a case, one which even you will believe, of a sailor lost in a whale's mouth and recovered from its belly; maybe not after half a day, perhaps after only half an hour.
And then people will believe the myth of  Bartley, which was begotten by the myth of Jonah.
For the point is this: not that myth refers us back to some original event which has been fancifully transcribed as it passed through the collective memory; but that it refers us forward to something that will happen, that must happen.
Myth will become reality, however sceptical we might be.

AT 8 PM ON Saturday, 13th May 1939, the liner St Louis left its home port of Hamburg.
It was a cruise ship, and most of the 937 passengers booked on its transatlantic voyage carried visas confirming that they were ‘tourists, travelling for pleasure’.
The words were an evasion, however, as was the purpose of their voyage.
All but a few of them were Jews, refugees from a Nazi state which intended to dispossess, transport and exterminate them.
Many, indeed, had already been dispossessed, since emigrants from Germany were permitted to take with them no more than a nominal ten Reichsmarks.
This enforced poverty made them easier targets for propaganda: if they left with no more than their allowance, they could be portrayed as shabby Untermenschen scuttling away like rats; if they managed to outwit the system, then they were economic criminals fleeing with stolen goods.
All this was normal.
The St Louis was flying the swastika flag, which was normal; its crew included half-a-dozen Gestapo agents, which was also normal.
The shipping line had instructed the captain to lay in cheaper cuts of meat for this voyage, to remove luxury goods from the shops and free postcards from the public rooms; but the captain largely circumvented such orders, decreeing that this journey should resemble other cruises by the St Louis and be, as far as possible, normal.
So when the Jews arrived on board from a mainland where they had been despised, systematically  humiliated and imprisoned, they discovered that although this ship was legally still part of Germany, flew the swastika and had large portraits of Hitler in its public rooms, the Germans with whom they had dealings were courteous, attentive and even obedient.
This was abnormal.
None of these Jews — half of whom were women and children — had any intention of revisiting Germany in the near future.
Nevertheless, in accordance with the regulations of the shipping company, they had all been obliged to buy return tickets.
This payment, they were told, was designed to cover ‘unforeseen eventualities’.
When the refugees landed in Havana, they would be given by the Hamburg-Amerika line a receipt for the unused part of the fare.
The money itself had been lodged in a special account in Germany: if ever they returned there, they could collect it.
Even Jews who had been released from concentration camps on strict condition that they left the Fatherland immediately were obliged to pay for the round trip.
Along with their tickets the refugees had bought landing permits from the Cuban director of immigration, who had given a personal guarantee that they would face no difficulties entering his country.
It was he who had classed them as ‘tourists, travelling for pleasure’; and in the course of the voyage some passengers, particularly the younger ones, were able to make the remarkable transition from despised Untermensch to pleasure-seeking tourist.
Perhaps their escape from Germany felt as miraculous as that of Jonah from the whale.
Every day there was food, drink, and dancing.
Despite a warning to crew members from the Gestapo cell about contravention of the Law for the Protection of German Blood and Honour, sexual activity continued as normal on a cruise.
Towards the end of the Atlantic crossing, the traditional costume ball took place.
The band played Glenn Miller; Jews appeared as pirates, sailors and Hawaiian dancers.
Some high-spirited girls came as harem women, with Arab dress made from bedsheets — a transformation which struck the more orthodox on board as unseemly.
On Saturday 27th May the St Louis anchored in Havana Harbour.
At 4 am the klaxon for reveille sounded, and half an  hour later the breakfast gong.
Small boats came out to the liner, some bearing vendors of coconuts and bananas, others containing friends and relatives who shouted up names to the rail.
The ship was flying a quarantine flag, which was normal.
The captain had to certify to the Port of Havana medical officer that no-one on board was ‘an idiot, or insane, or suffering from a loathsome or contagious disease’.
When this had been done, immigration officers began to process the passengers, examining their papers and indicating whereabouts on the pier to expect their luggage.
The first fifty refugees gathered at the top of the ladder, waiting for the boat to take them ashore.
Immigration, like emigration, is a process in which money is no less important than principles or laws, and often sounder than either of them.
Money reassures the host country — or, in the case of Cuba, the transit country — that the new arrivals will not be a charge on the state.
Money also serves to bribe the officials who have to take this decision.
The Cuban director of immigration had made a great deal of money from previous boatloads of Jews; the President of Cuba had not made enough money from them.
The President had therefore issued a decree on 6th May revoking the validity of tourist visas when the true purpose of travel was immigration.
Did this decree apply to those on board the St Louis or not?
The ship had sailed from Hamburg after the law had been promulgated; on the other hand, the landing permits had been issued earlier.
It was a question on which much argument and money could be spent.
The number of the presidential decree was 937, which the superstitious might have noticed was also the number of passengers on board when the St Louis left Europe.
A delay developed.
Nineteen Cubans and Spaniards were allowed to disembark, plus three passengers with authentic visas; the remaining 900 or so Jews waited for news of the negotiations which involved, variously, the Cuban President, his director of immigration, the shipping line, the local relief committee, the ship's captain and a lawyer flown in from the New York headquarters of the Joint Distribution Committee.
These talks lasted several days.
Factors to be considered were  money, pride, political ambition and Cuban public opinion.
The captain of the St Louis , while distrustful of both local politicians and his own shipping line, was convinced at least of one thing: that if Cuba proved inaccessible, the United States, to which most of his passengers had the right of eventual entry, would surely accept them earlier than promised.
Some of the marooned passengers were less confident, and became unnerved by the uncertainties, the delay, the heat.
They had spent so long reaching a place of safety, and were now so near.
Friends and relatives continued to circle the liner in small boats; a fox terrier, sent on ahead from Germany, was rowed out each day and held up towards the rail and its distant owners.
A passengers' committee had been formed, to whom the shipping company gave free cabling facilities; appeals for intercession were despatched to influential people, including the wife of the Cuban president.
It was during this time that two passengers attempted suicide, one with a syringe and tranquillizers, another by slashing his wrists and jumping into the sea; both survived.
Thereafter, to prevent further suicide attempts, there were security patrols at night; the lifeboats were always ready, and the ship was lit up by floodlights.
These measures reminded some Jews of the concentration camps they had recently left.
The St Louis was not meant to leave Havana empty after dropping its 937 emigrants.
Some 250 passengers were booked on the return trip to Hamburg via Lisbon.
One suggestion was that 250 of the Jews could at least be disembarked to make room for those on shore.
But how would you choose the 250 who were to be allowed off the Ark?
Who would separate the clean from the unclean?
Was it to be done by casting lots?
The predicament of the St Louis was not a disregarded, local issue.
The voyage was being logged by the German, British and American press.
Der Stürmer commented that if the Jews chose to take up their return passages to Germany, they should be accommodated at Dachau and Buchenwald.
Meanwhile, in Havana harbour, American reporters managed to get on board what they nicknamed, perhaps too easily, ‘the ship that shamed the world’.
Such publicity does not necessarily help refugees.
If  the shame belongs to the whole world, then why should one particular country — which had already accepted many Jewish refugees — be so frequently expected to bear it?
The world, apparently, did not feel its shame so strongly that it moved its hand to its wallet.
The Cuban government accordingly voted to exclude the immigrants and ordered the St Louis to leave the island's territorial waters.
This did not mean, the President added, that he had closed the door on negotiations; merely that he would not consider further offers until the ship had left harbour.
How much are refugees?
It depends how desperate they are, how rich their patrons, how greedy their hosts.
In the world of entry permits and panic it is always a seller's market.
Prices are arbitrary, speculative, evanescent.
The lawyer from the Joint Distribution Committee put forward an opening offer of $50,000 for the safe landing of the Jews, and was told that the sum might usefully be trebled.
But if trebled, why not trebled again?
The director of immigration — who had already received $150 a head for the landing permits which had not been honoured — suggested to the shipping line a fee of $250,000 to help get decree number 937 rescinded.
A purported intermediary of the President seemed to think that the Jews could be landed for $1,000,000.
In the end, the Cuban government was to fix on a bond of $500 for each Jew.
This price had a certain logic, being the amount of surety which each official immigrant into the country had to post.
So the 907 passengers on board, who had already paid their outward and return fares, who had bought their permits and then been reduced to an official ten Deutschmarks each, would cost $453,500.
As the liner started its engines, a group of women charged the accommodation ladder; they were repelled by Cuban police with pistols.
During its six days in Havana harbour the St Louis had become a tourist attraction, and its departure was watched by an estimated crowd of 100,000.
The captain had been given permission by his superiors in Hamburg to sail for any port which would accept his passengers.
At first he steamed idly in ever-widening circles, waiting to be recalled to Havana; then  headed north for Miami.
When the ship reached the American coast it was greeted by a US coastguard cutter.
But this apparent welcome was a rebuff: the cutter was there to see that the St Louis did not enter territorial waters.
The State Department had already decided that if the Jews were turned down by Cuba, they would not be granted entry into the United States.
Money was a less direct factor here: high unemployment and reliable xenophobia were sufficient justifications.
The Dominican Republic offered to accept the refugees for the standardized market price of $500 a head; but this merely duplicated the Cuban tariff.
Venezuela, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Argentina were all approached; each declined to bear the world's shame single-handed.
In Miami the immigration inspector announced that the St Louis would not be allowed to dock in any US port.
The liner, denied entry to the whole American continent, continued steaming northwards.
Those on board were aware that they were approaching the point at which it would have to swing east and head inevitably back to Europe.
Then, at 4.50 on the afternoon of Sunday, 4th June, a news flash was picked up.
The President of Cuba had apparently given permission for the Jews to be landed on the Isle of Pines, a former penal colony.
The captain turned the St Louis round and headed south again.
Passengers brought their luggage up on deck.
That evening, over dinner, the spirits of the gala evening returned.
The next morning, three hours' sailing away from the Isle of Pines, the ship received a cable: permission to disembark had not yet been confirmed.
The passenger committee, who throughout the crisis had been sending telegrams to prominent Americans asking them to intercede, could think of no one else to contact.
Someone suggested the Mayor of St Louis, Missouri, thinking that the consonance of names might perhaps evoke sympathy.
A cable was duly despatched.
The Cuban President had asked for a $500 surety per refugee, plus a subsidiary guarantee to cover food and lodging during the period of transit on the Isle of Pines.
The American lawyer had offered (according to the Cuban government) a total of  $443,000, but further stipulated that this sum was to cover not just the refugees on the St Louis but also 150 Jews on two other ships.
The Cuban government found itself unable to accept this counter-proposal and withdrew its own offer.
The lawyer for the Joint Committee responded by agreeing in full to the original Cuban demand.
The government in return regretted that its offer had already been terminated and could not now be revived.
The St Louis turned round and headed north for a second time.
As the ship began its return voyage to Europe, the British and French governments were informally sounded out to see if their countries might take the Jews.
The British answer was that they would prefer to view the present difficulty in the wider context of the general European refugee situation, but that they might be prepared to consider possible subsequent entry of the Jews to Britain after their return to Germany.
There had been unconfirmed or impracticable offers from the President of Honduras, from an American philanthropist, even from a quarantine station in the Panama Canal Zone; the ship steamed on.
The passenger committee addressed its appeals to political and religious leaders throughout Europe; though its messages now had to be shorter, since the shipping line had withdrawn free cabling facilities.
One suggestion made at this time was that the strongest swimmers among the Jews should jump overboard at intervals, thus forcing the St Louis to stop and turn round.
This would slow its progress towards Europe and allow more time for negotiations.
The idea was not taken up.
German radio announced that since no country would agree to accept the boat-load of Jews, the Fatherland would be obliged to take them back and support them.
It was not difficult to guess where they might be supported.
What's more, if the St Louis was forced to unload its cargo of degenerates and criminals back in Hamburg, this would prove that the world's supposed concern was mere hypocrisy.
Nobody wanted the shabby Jews, and nobody therefore had any right to criticize whatever welcome the Fatherland might extend to the filthy parasites on their return.
It was at this time that a group of younger Jews attempted to  hijack the ship.
They invaded the bridge, but were dissuaded from further action by the captain.
For his part, he conceived a plan of setting fire to the St Louis off Beachy Head, which would compel the rescuing nation to take his passengers in.
This desperate scheme might even have been tried.
Finally, when many had given up hope and the liner was nearing Europe, the Belgian government announced that it would admit 200 of the passengers.
In the days that followed, Holland agreed to take 194, Britain 350, and France 250.
After a voyage of 10,000 miles, the St Louis docked at Antwerp, 300 miles from its port of departure.
Relief workers from the four countries involved had already met to decide the distribution of the Jews.
Most of those on board possessed the right of eventual entry into the United States, and had therefore been ascribed a number on the US quota list.
It was observed that the relief workers competed for passengers with low numbers, since these refugees would leave their countries of transit the soonest.
In Antwerp a pro-Nazi youth organization had distributed handbills bearing the slogan: ‘We too want to help the Jews.
If they call at our offices each will receive gratis a length of rope and a long nail.’
The passengers were disembarked.
Those admitted to Belgium were put on a train whose doors were locked and windows nailed shut; they were told that such measures were necessary for their own protection.
Those admitted to Holland were immediately transferred to a camp surrounded by barbed wire and guard dogs.
On Wednesday, 21st June the British contingent from the St Louis docked at Southampton.
They were able to reflect that their wanderings at sea had lasted precisely forty days and forty nights.
On 1st September the Second World War began, and the passengers from the St Louis shared in the fate of European Jewry.
Their chances rose or fell depending upon the country to which they had been allotted.
Estimates of how many survived vary.

Just time for a card — we leave in half an hour — had our last night on the Johnny Walker now it's local firewater or nothing remember what I said on the phone and don't have it cut too short.
Love you your Circus Strongman.

My own darling
Just spent 24 hours on a bus with the dashboard covered in St Christophers or whatever the local version hereabouts is.
Wouldn't have minded if the driver had gone in for some stronger magic — the old Christianity didn't seem to be having much effect on his driving.
When not thinking about puking your guts up round every hairpin bend, scenery magnificent.
Great big trees, mountains — that sort of thing — I've got some postcards.
Crew all a bit over-excited at the moment — if I hear another joke about ‘I was going Caracas back there’ I think I'll strangle someone.
Still, that's normal on a job like this.
Not that I've ever done a job like this before, should be great fun.
It'd better be after all those needles they stuck in me so I won't get beri-beri and co.
It's a relief to get away from people recognizing you as well.
You know, even with the beard and glasses they still copped the face in Caracas.
At the airport, of course, but that's normal anyway.
No, it was funny.
Guess what they'd seen me in?
Not your upmarket angst number with the Pinter script that got the Palme d'Or, none of that.
No, that filthy little American soap I did for Hal Screwyouupalotodos.
It's STILL playing here.
Kids come up in the street and say, ‘Hey Mista Rick, how ya doin'?’
What about that?
The poverty here is something else.
Still, after India nothing will surprise me.
Now what have you done about your hair?
I hope you haven't gone and done anything silly to it just to get your own back for me going away.
I know what you girls are like, you say you'll just have it short to see what it looks like, and then you say Pedro at the salon won't let you grow it just for the moment, and then you say you've got to look your best for some wedding or other and you can't go with it straggly and then you end up not growing it again and if I don't mention it every week you think I've learned to like it and if I do mention it every week you think I'm nagging so I don't mention it and I'm stuck with it.
And it's not fair to say it's because of the beard because the beard's not my fault, they just didn't shave in the jungle in whatever century it's going to be when we get there and I know I grew it early but that's the way I am, I like to start thinking myself into the part as soon as possible.
You know what Dirk says, how he starts with the shoes, once he gets the shoes right he knows what the rest of the character's like, well with me it's the face.
Sorry if it's the first thing you see in the morning, still it's not everyone who can say they've been sleeping with a Jesuit.
A very old Jesuit too.
Weather very hot, laundry problems I expect.
Still taking those tummy tablets.
Had a word with Vic about the script and he says not to worry but they always say that at this stage, don't they?
I told him what I said to you on the phone about shouldn't he be given a bit more obvious humanity because priests aren't great box-office nowadays and Vic said we'd talk about it nearer the time.
Getting on well with Matt — obviously there's going to be some competition once we start work but he's not half as paranoid as I thought he'd be, a bit back-slapping, still I guess  that's Yanks for you.
I told him my Vanessa story and he told me his and we'd both heard them before!
Got stinko paralytico together on our last night in town and ended up doing the Zorba dance in a restaurant!
Matt tried plate-smashing but they said it wasn't the local custom and threw us out!
Charged us for the plates, too.
You know what they call post offices out here?
Our Lady of Communications.
You probably have to get down on your knees for next-day delivery.
Not that we've seen one of them for miles.
God knows if I'll be able to post this before the Jungle starts.
Maybe we'll come across a friendly native with a forked stick going in the right direction and I'll give him the big-screen smile and hand it over.
(Joke).
Don't worry about me.
Love you.

Letter 2
Darling
If you look in your photo album for our flat-smouldering party you'll see there's something missing.
Don't worry — I've got it.
It's the one where you've got your chipmunk face on.
You've got a bit wet out here — terrible downpour couple of days ago — but you still don't mind being kissed last thing at night.
You might get a bit crumpled from here on in as we've seen our last hotel for a bit.
Now it's all Boy Scout stuff and bivouacs and tents.
Hope I get the sleep I need.
It's so hard to work on full glow when you've only had a couple of hours kip.
Anyway we're well into the Jungle now.
Lots of delays.
Usual stuff — you arrange that on such-and-such a day you'll turn up with so many people and so much luggage and he'll transport you to the next place and when you turn up he pretends things have changed and you didn't say fifty but fifteen and anyway the price has gone up and so on and so bloody on until he gets the backhander he  wants.
God, when things like that happen I just feel like shouting I Want To Work in a very loud voice.
I did that one day when things got hairier than usual, went down to where some bandit was trying to rip us off and practically rubbed beards with him and shouted into his face I Want To Work For Christ's Sake Let Me Work, but Vic said that wasn't being helpful.
Later.
Matt was peeing in the river when one of the sparks came up and told him it wasn't a good idea.
Apparently they've got this tiny fish which is attracted by the heat or whatever and can swim up your pee as you're peeing.
Didn't sound likely at first but think of salmon I suppose.
Then what it does is swim straight into your dick and once it gets there it sticks out a couple of spines sideways and just stays there.
Ouch in spades, to say the least of it.
The sparks says you can't get it out, it's like having an umbrella opened up in there, you have to have the whole doings chopped off in hospital.
Matt didn't know whether to believe him but can you risk it?
No one 's peeing in the river at the moment, anyway.
Later.
We were puttering up river late in the afternoon and the sun was beginning to go down over these huge trees and a flight of big birds, herons or something, were taking off like pink seaplanes as someone said and the second assistant suddenly stood up and yelled out This is paradise, this is fucking paradise.
Actually, feeling a bit depressed, love.
Sorry to lay this on you, not fair I know as I'll probably be right as rain by the time you get this.
Bloody Matt getting me down.
What an ego.
You'd think no-one else had ever made a film except him and you can see him coming on all good mates with the crew so they'll make things easier for him when he gets in front of camera, so he looks five years younger and I get the shiny nose.
Vic's not tough enough for this job, to be frank.
You need one of those slave-driving old studio bosses if you ask me, not a sensitive graduate who went into movies because he liked the clouds in Antonioni and then turned himself into a nouvelle vague Deutscher all hot for Truthspiel.
I ask you, forty of us slogging into the Jungle all because we bought his line about  needing to work our way into the reality of a couple of deeply dead Jesuit priests.
How this applies to the crew as well I don't know but I expect Vic's got some theory to cover it.
Us going in on foot and then the equipment being airlifted in is about as arsy-versy as you can get.
He won't even let us use the radio-telephone until after we've made the rendez-vous.
The focus-puller's girlfriend is having a baby and he wanted to call headquarters in Caracas to see if there was any news but Vic said no.
Bloody weather.
Bloody hot all the time.
Sweating like a pig,comme un porco .
Still worrying about the script.
Think I'll have to do some rewrites on my part.
No chance of getting any laundry done unless we meet some tribe of washerwomen waiting for custom outside one of those zinc shacks like we saw in that village in Provence do you remember?
Bloody tin sign for Coca-Cola at a trading post this morning.
I ask you, hundreds of miles from bloody anywhere and the Coke reps have been there before you and shat on the landscape.
Or some chum of Matt's put it there to make him feel at home.
Sorry about this.
Love Charlie
Letter 3
Hey Good Looking!
Sorry about that whingeing on at the end of the last letter.
Everything much better now.
For one thing we've all started peeing in the river again.
We were asking Fish Sparks as we call him how he knew about the fish that swims up your pee and he said he'd seen some fat explorer fellow on the box going on about it, which sounded likely enough.
But then we asked him a bit more about it and he made his fatal mistake.
He said this explorer had said he'd had some special underpants made so that he could pee in the river safely.
He got a cricket protector, the  sparks says, and cut the front bit out and stuck a tea-strainer down it.
Well I ask you.
If you're telling fibs, keep them simple, that's the rule, isn't it?
Never over-egg the pudding.
So we all had a good laugh at the sparks and all of us unzipped our flies and peed in the river whether we wanted to or not.
The only person that didn't was Fish, who had to save face and went on claiming it was true.
So that cheered us up a bit as you can imagine but what really cheered us up was making contact with the Indians.
I mean, if the bandits on the way here were anything to go by (‘here', if you want to look it up in your schoolgirl atlas, is somewhere near the Mocapra) why should the Indians keep their word?
Matt said afterwards he'd half expected the whole thing would turn out to be a wild goose chase and I told him I thought the same.
But there they were, four of them, just where they said they'd be, in a clearing on a bend in the river, naked as nature intended, standing very upright which still didn't make them very tall and looking at us without any fear.
Without any curiosity either, in a funny sort of way, which was odd.
You expect they'll want to prod you or something.
But they just stood there as if we were the odd ones not them, which when you come to think about it is dead right.
They watched us unpack everything and then we set off.
Didn't offer to help carry anything which was a bit of a surprise but then I suppose they're not Sherpas are they?
It's about two days march apparently to the rest of the tribe and the river we're looking for.
We couldn't see the track they were following at all— amazing sense of direction they must have in the Jungle.
You'd be lost here I can tell you angel, especially given you don't know how to get from Shepherd's Bush to Hammersmith without a police escort.
* We marched for about two hours then stopped for the night and ate fish the Indians had caught in the river while they were waiting for us.
Very tired, but quite a day.
Kiss you.
* Joke (not serious)
Later.
A whole day on the move.
Glad I did all that training in the gym.
Some of the crew puffing after only half an hour or so, which isn't surprising as the only exercise they take in the  normal run of things is putting their legs under a table and aiming their snouts at the trough.
Oh yes and putting their hands up to order another bottle.
Matt's pretty fit from all those outdoor movies where they put olive oil on his pectorals (though not as fit as he ought to be) and the two of us gave the crew a bit of a hard time, said union rules didn't apply in the Jungle, and so on.
They certainly didn't want to get left behind!
Fish Sparks, who's been a bit down in the mouth since we rumbled his story, thought it was terrifically funny to start calling the Indians things like Sitting Bull and Tonto, but of course they didn't understand and anyway the rest of us sort of froze him out.
It just wasn't funny, anyway.
They're incredible, these Indians.
Walking starkers through the forest, incredibly agile, never get tired, killed a monkey in a tree with a blowpipe.
Had it for dinner, well some of us did, the squeamish ones had a tin of corned beef.
I had the monkey.
Tasted a bit like oxtail only much redder.
A bit stringy but delicious.
Tuesday.
God knows how the post system's going to work.
At the moment we just give it to Rojas — he's the fourth assistant and a local and he's been appointed postman.
All that means is that he puts the letters into a plastic bag so they won't get eaten by beetles or woodworm or whatever.
Then when we meet up with the copter he'll take the mail out.
So God knows when you'll get this.
Miss you (pause while I do my Circus Strongman howl).
Today we should have met up with the rest of the tribe but we aren't as fit as we might be.
I bet some of the crew thought there'd be wheels right into the Jungle and food trucks parked every few miles and they'd get burgers and chips served by girls wearing flower garlands round their necks.
Fat Dick the sound man probably packed a  Hawaiiiiiian shirt.
You have to hand it to Vic in a way.
Smallest crew-to-budget ratio in years.
Me and Matt doing our own stunts (good old Norman really screwed the dollars up for me on that clause).
Not even daily rushes either — the copter's only coming in every three days because Vic thinks it'll break our concentration or something no doubt posher intellectually than that.
Lab report  over the radio-telephone, the rushes with the copter.
And the studio went along with it all.
Amazing, isn't it?
No it isn't amazing, as you well know sweetie.
The studio thinks Vic's a genius and gave him as much as they could until the insurance boys dug their heels in over big-name leads falling out of a canoe and then they went down the list and found a couple of guys the industry could afford to lose.
* So I've been a bad boy at times but they reckon I can't walk out on a job if I'm in the Jungle and Matt's temperamental which means he doesn't normally work unless they give him a hamper full of white powder but he seems to have kicked it and there aren't too many dealers swinging through the trees like Tarzan out here.
And we agree to Vic's conditions because we bloody need to and deep down we probably think Vic's a genius too.
* Joke.
Well, sort of.
No real danger, I'm sure.
Wondering if it was a mistake to have the monkey last night.
It certainly slowed me down a bit today, and Matt was behind a bush a lot as well.
Later.
Sorry, Wednesday.
Met the tribe.
The greatest day of my life.
Except for meeting you, babe, of course.
They were just there, suddenly, as we came over a hill and saw a river below us.
The lost river and the lost people side by side — amazing.
They're quite short, and you'd think they were plump except it s all muscle, and they don't have a stitch on.
The girls are pretty, too (don't worry, angel — riddled with diseases).
The funny thing is there don't seem to be any old folks.
Or maybe they've left them behind somewhere.
But we did have this idea that the whole tribe went around together.
Puzzling.
Also, I've run out of mosquito stuff — the really powerful one anyway.
Getting bitten quite a lot.
Vic says not to worry — did I think Father Firmin had insect repellent all those years ago?
I said authenticity was one thing but did my devoted fans really want to see me on the big screen with spots a foot across all over my face?
Vic told me I had to suffer for my art.
I told Vic to fuck off.
Bloody Truthspiel.
Thursday.
We've set up camp now on the bank.
A couple of camps actually, one for whites (most of whom are brown with  red spots) and one for Indians.
I said why didn't we have one big camp, for Christ's sake.
Some of the crew were against this because they thought they'd get their watches stolen (I ask you) and some in favour so that they could get a closer look at the women (I ask you).
Vic said he thought two camps were a good idea because there would have been two originally and it would psychologically prepare the Indians for playing their ancestors, which I said was just a  rationalisation of elitism.
Anyway things got quite hot and eventually one of the guides was sent over to talk to the Indians and the word came back that they wouldn't share their camp with us anyway, which is quite funny I suppose.
Here comes the copter so I'll end now.
Love Charlie
Letter 4
Dear Pips,
First rendez-vous!
They coptered in the genny and the rest of the equipment.
Great excitement (except for the Indians who ignored it all).
Food, ciggies.
No mosquito stuff on board— can you believe it?
Another thing — Vic wouldn't let them bring in newspapers, which pissed me off.
I mean we're not kids are we?
Reading a two-week-old copy of The Independent isn't likely to screw up my acting, is it?
Or is it?
I'm amazed Vic allowed us letters.
None for Charlie.
I know I told you not to write except in emergency but I didn't mean it.
Hope you guessed.
Friday.
Look, I know you don't want to talk about it, but I think this spell of being apart will do us lots of good.
In lots of ways.
Really.
I'm getting too old for hellraising anyway.
‘MY HELLRAISING DAYS ARE OVER’ SAYS TV'S ‘BAD-BOY’CHARLIE.
Love you.
Pippa love, I really think it's the effect of the Indians (oh, Saturday).
They're so open, so direct.
There they are, not a stitch on them, they say what they mean, do what they want, eat when they're hungry, make love as if it's the most natural thing in the world *, and lie down to die when they reach the end of their lives.
It's really something.
I don't mean I could do it myself, not straight away, I just mean I get a great sense of comradeship with these people.
I almost feel I've been sent here so they can teach me a lesson about life.
Does that make sense?
It's all right, sweetie, I'm not coming back with a bone through my nose, but I might come back with a bit less of a bone in my head.
All that business about Linda — I know we agreed not to talk about it — but I feel such a shit out here.
Hurting you.
Not telling the truth.
Out here, with the lost river running past my feet, learning the names of birds I don't even know the names of in English, I feel good about us.
* Not personal experience.
Charlie's nose clean.
Sunday.
It's not just distance lends enchantment or whatever.
It's something about being here .
You remember the American astronauts, how they went to the moon and came back totally changed by looking at the earth and seeing it like just any old planet all small and a long way away?
Some of them got religious or went barmy I seem to remember, but the point is they were all different when they came back.
It's a bit like that with me, except that instead of going into the technological future I had to go back in time.
Actually, I don't really mean that, back in time.
All the crew here think the Indians are fantastically primitive just because they don't have radios.
I think they're fantastically advanced and mature because they don't have radios.
They're teaching me something without knowing they're doing it.
I'm beginning to see things a lot more in perspective.
God I'm damn sorry about Linda.
Monday.
A long time setting up, then it rained.
One of the girls is teaching me the language.
Don't worry, chipmunk, riddled with diseases I'm sure.
* Tried to find out what they call themselves, you know, name of the tribe.
Guess what, THEY DON'T HAVE A NAME FOR THEMSELVES!!! and they don't have a name for their language either.
Isn't that  amazing!!
Incredibly mature.
It's like, nationalism out of the window.
* Sort of catch-phrase with the crew.
If anyone starts talking about sex or looking at the Indian women, someone always says, ‘Riddled with diseases I'm sure.’
Probably not so funny in London.
Tuesday.
There's a really good feeling now we've started.
Everyone pulling together.
None of this silly bloody union rules.
Everyone contributing .
I'm sure it's the influence of the Indians.
It's how things should be.
Wednesday.
I think my accent's improving.
There's a big white stork sort of bird called a thkarni .
I think that's how you write it down.
Anyway, I say thkarni when one takes off or lands on the water, and the Indians think this is jolly funny.
They fall about laughing.
Well they aren't any better at saying Charlie.
Thursday.
Not much.
Bitten by 80000000000000 mosquitoes.
Matt makes stupid joke.
If you look closely, he's bandy-legged, I swear.
Friday.
It's amazing when you think about it.
Here's this tribe of Indians, totally obscure, don't even have a name for themselves.
A couple of hundred years ago two Jesuit missionaries trying to find their way back to the Orinoco stumble across them, get them to build a raft and then pole the two Godmen several hundred miles south while the said Godmen preach them the Gospel and try to get them to wear Levis.
Just when they get near their destination the raft capsizes, the missionaries nearly drown and the Indians disappear.
Melt into the Jungle and no-one sees them again until Vic's researchers track them down a year ago.
Now they're helping us do exactly the same thing a couple of hundred years on.
What I'm dying to know is does the tribe remember?
Do they have ballads about transporting the two white men dressed as women up to the great watery anaconda to the south, or however they might put it?
Or did the white men vanish from the tribe's memory as completely as the tribe vanished for the white man?
So many things to think about.
And what will happen when we've gone?
Will  they disappear again for another two or three hundred years?
Or disappear forever wiped out by some killer bug and all that will be left of them is a film in which they're playing their own ancestors?
I'm not sure I can get my head round that.
My blessings on thee, daughter, sin no more.
*
Love, Charlie
* Joke!!
Nothing from you Sunday or Wednesday.
Hope Rojas has something tomorrow.
Didn't mean you not to write whatever I said.
Will send this anyway.
Letter 5
Darling
This priest outfit must be the most uncomfortable garment ever invented for Jungle travel.
Makes you sweat like a pig,comme un porco .
How did old Father Firmin keep his dignity, I ask myself.
Still I suppose you could say he suffered for his religion in the same way I suffer for my art.
Sunday.
My God, guess what?
Fat Dick the sound man was peeing in the river last night when one of the Indians came up to him all agitated, making lots of gestures, sign language, sort of swimming with his hands and so on.
Dick doesn't follow him in fact he thinks the bloke is trying to get off with him which is a bit of a laugh if you've seen the Indian women, until the Indian runs off and fetches Miguel who's one of the guides.
Lots more gestures and explanations and Dick zips up his trousers pretty smartish.
Guess what?
The Indian was telling him about this little fish that lives in the river and — you can guess the rest!!!
Not much chance of this particular member of this particular tribe watching British telly the same night Fish Sparks was.
And not much chance of Fishy learning enough of the local lingo to set up a sting like this.
So we just had to accept he was right all along!
Boy did he have the last laugh.
Monday.
Here's a funny thing.
While the Indians appear to understand roughly what we're doing — they're happy to do retakes and don't seem at all put out by this great big eye being pointed at them — they don't seem to understand about the idea of acting.
I mean sure they're acting their ancestors and they're quite willing (in exchange for some Mickey Mouse presents) to build us a raft and transport us upstream on it and be filmed doing this.
But they won't do anything else.
If Vic says could you stand in a different way or use the pole like this and tries to demonstrate they simply won't.
Absolutely refuse.
This is how we pole a raft and just because a white man is watching through his funny machine we aren't going to do it any differently.
The other thing is even more incredible.
They actually think that when Matt and I are dressed up as Jesuits we actually are Jesuits!
They think we've gone away and these two blokes in black dresses have turned up!
Father Firmin is just as real a person for them as Charlie, though I'm glad to say they like Charlie more.
But you can't persuade them about what's going on.
The crew think this is pretty stupid of them but I wonder if it isn't fantastically mature.
The crew think they're such a primitive civilization they haven't even discovered acting yet.
I wonder if it's the opposite and they're a sort of post-acting civilization, maybe the first one on the earth.
Like, they don't need it any more, so they've forgotten about it and don't understand it any longer.
Quite a thought!
Wednesday.
Ought to have said more about the job.
Not going badly.
Script isn't what I remembered, but then it never is, usually because they've changed it.
Matt isn't too bad to work with.
I asked Make-Up to give him a few mosquito bites but he refused point-blank.
Said he wanted to be the pretty one for a change.
Quite funny that — I mean it's obvious that deep down he thinks he's jolly good-looking!
I suppose I'd better not tell him that thing you said about his face looking as if it was carved out of corned beef.
Thursday.
Terrible thing happened.
Quite terrible.
One of the Indians fell off the raft and was drowned.
Just swept away.
We stared at the water which was pretty choppy and waited for the Indian to surface but he never did.
Naturally we said we'd stop work for the day.
Guess what?
The Indians wouldn't hear of it.
What good old troupers they are!
Friday.
Thinking about yesterday's incident.
We were much more upset about it than the Indians were.
I mean, he must have been somebody's brother or husband or something, but there wasn't any crying or anything.
I half expected that when we pitched camp for the night there'd be some sort of ceremony — I don't know, burning a bundle of clothes or whatever.
Not so.
Same old jolly camp-fire life went on as per usual.
I wondered if they hadn't liked the fellow who went overboard, but that's too obvious.
Maybe they don't distinguish between life and death in some way.
Maybe they don't think he's ‘gone’ as we do — or at least not gone altogether.
Gone to a nicer bit of the river.
I tried this out on Matt who said, ‘Hey man I didn't know you had hippie blood.’
Matt is not exactly the most spiritual and sophisticated fellow you've ever met.
Believes in making your own way through life, walking tall, shooting straight, balling chicks as he puts it and spitting in the eye of anyone who does you wrong.
That at any rate seems to be the sum of his wisdom.
He thinks the Indians are rather cute kids who haven't yet invented the video recorder.
I must say it's pretty funny that a chap like him ends up playing a Jesuit priest having doctrinal disputes in the rain forest.
The fact is, he's one of those perfectly efficient American actors whose careers are decided by their image makers.
I told him about taking six months off and doing rep in the provinces just to get back in touch with live acting and live audiences and he reacted as if I told him I'd had a mental breakdown.
Say what you like, I think the stage is the place you learn to act.
Matt can twitch his face in any direction and crinkle up his eyes knowing that his jailbait fans will be sitting there wetting themselves.
But can he act with his body?
Call me old-fashioned, but I think a lot of American actors just do a sort of swagger and leave it at that.
Tried to explain all this to Vic, who said I was doing fine and Matt was doing fine and he thought we'd gel together on screen.
Sometimes I do wish he'd LISTEN to what I say.
Here comes the post, or rather the copter.
Nothing from you yet.
— love, Charlie
Letter 6
Pippa love
Look I know we said we wouldn't talk about it and maybe it's not fair cos I don't know what state you'll be in when you get this, but why don't we just move to the country and have babies?
No I haven't fallen in the river or anything.
You've no idea how good it's been for me out here.
I've cut out coffee after lunch and almost don't smoke at all.
Well the Indians don't, do they, I say to myself.
The Indians don't need to support the mighty firm of Philip Morris Inc. of Richmond Va.
When things get tough they sometimes chew on a little green leaf, which I reckon is their equivalent of the occasional ciggy one takes when the director is behaving like a prize muffin.
So why not cut it down like they do?
And that Linda thing.
I know you probably don't want to hear her name ever again and if that's what you want that's my promise, but it's all to do with London isn't it?
Not really to do with us at all.
Just bloody London with its grime and filthy streets and the booze.
Well that's not really living, the way we do in cities, is it?
Also I think cities make people lie to one another.
Do you think that's possible?
These Indians never lie, same as they don't know how to act.
No pretence.
Now I don't think that's primitive at all, I think it's bloody mature.
And I'm sure it's because they live in the Jungle not in cities.
They spend all their time surrounded by nature and the one thing nature doesn't do is lie.
It just goes ahead and does its thing, as Matt would say.
Walks tall and shoots  straight.
It may not be very nice some of the time but it doesn't tell lies.
Which is why I think the country and babies is the answer.
And when I say the country I don't mean one of those villages just off the motorway full of people just like us buying Australian Chardonnay from the local wine merchant and the only time you hear an ooo-aarr accent is when you're listening to the Archers in the bath.
I mean the real country, somewhere hidden away — Wales maybe or Yorkshire.
Sunday.
The baby thing.
It's to do with the Indians in a funny sort of way.
You know I said they're all fantastically healthy and yet there aren't any old folks even though we thought they travelled around together in a group?
Well, I finally got Miguel to talk to them about it and it turns out the reason there aren't any old folk around is because they don't live much longer than about 35.
So I was wrong when I thought they were fantastically healthy and a good advert for the Jungle.
The truth is it's only the fantastically healthy ones who can get by at all.
What a turnaround.
But the point is, I'm now older than most of this tribe will ever be and that feels like a chill wind.
And if we lived in the country then it wouldn't be me coming home every night whacked out and wanting to be looked after and having a squawking infant instead.
If I only took the big parts and none of this TV crap I'd just go away to film, and then when I was around I'd really be around.
See?
I could make a playpen for him and buy him one of those big wooden Arks with all the animals in and I could get one of those bags you carry babies around in like the Indians have had for centuries.
Then I'd go striding off across the moors to get the both of us out of your hair for a bit, what do you say?
By the way, I really am sorry I hit Gavin.
Monday.
Bit depressed, love.
Had this ludicrous tiff with Vic about a line.
Six bloody words, but I knew Firmin wouldn't say them.
I mean, I've been living this guy for three weeks now and Vic starts telling me how to speak?
He said OK rewrite them, so I held things up for an hour and at the end of it he said he wasn't convinced.
We tried it out all the same, because I insisted, and guess what?
Bloody Matt wasn't convinced either.
I said he  couldn't tell a line of dialogue from a line of coke and anyway his face was carved out of corned beef, and he threatened to punch me.
Stupid bloody film.
Tuesday.
Still boiling.
Wednesday.
Amazing thing.
You know I said about the Indians not understanding about acting.
Well in the last 2 days Firmin and Antonio have been getting more and more hostile (which isn't hard to do given how Charlie and Matt are currently feeling about one another) and you could really sense the Indians getting involved, following it all from their part of the raft as if their lives depended on it — which in a way they did I suppose because we were arguing about whether they had the right to be baptised and have their souls saved or not.
They sensed this somehow, I don't know.
Anyway today we had the scene where Matt had to hit me with the paddle sort of semi-accidentally.
It was best balsa wood of course, not that the Indians could know, but I duly went down poleaxed and Matt started pretending it was an accident.
The Indians were supposed to look on at what was happening as if these two white men in skirts were barmy.
That's what they'd been told to do.
But they didn't.
Lots of them came rushing over to me and started stroking my face and wetting my brow and making a sort of wailing noise, and then three of them turned on Matt looking really nasty.
Incredible!
What's more they might have done him an injury if he hadn't pulled off his cassock pretty smartish and turned back into Matt, which calmed them down.
Amazing!
It was only old Matt, and that nasty priest Antonio had gone away.
Then I slowly got to my feet and they all started laughing happily as if I wasn't dead after all.
The good thing was that Vic kept running so we didn't miss any of it.
Now he thinks he can work it in, which I'm pleased about because if this is the way the Indians react to me and Matt then maybe that's a pointer to how the fans will go.
Thursday.
Vic says the lab report on yesterday's scuffle wasn't too kosher.
Bet bloody Matt's been getting at him probably knew the camera had caught him looking shit-scared.
I said let's wait and see how it prints and Vic agreed but I didn't  get good vibes.
So much for Truthspiel: when they get it, they don't use it.
Friday.
I don't think the script's up to scratch, and the whole thing's underbudgeted, but one thing I will say for it is that it's ABOUT something.
I mean, it isn't afraid of the big issues.
Most films aren't about anything, are they, that's what I find more and more.
‘Two Priests up the Jungle’(which is what Old Fish Sparks sings from time to time to the tune of Red Sails in the Sunset)— sure, but it's about the sort of conflict running through human life in every time and every civilization.
Discipline v. permissiveness.
Sticking to the letter of the law v. sticking to its spirit.
Means and ends.
Doing the right thing for the wrong reason v. doing the wrong thing for the right reason.
How great ideas like the Church got bogged down in bureaucracy.
How Christianity starts off as the religion of peace but ends up violent like other religions.
You could say the same about Communism or anything else, any big idea.
I think this film could be really quite subversive in Eastern Europe and not because it's about priests either.
Whether they'd distribute it is another matter.
I said to Fish the film has a message for the trade unions as well if they could find it and he said he'd keep looking.
Pippa love, think about the baby thing, won't you?
Your Charlie
P.S. Funny thing happened today.
Not serious, but makes me wonder about the Indians.
P.P.S. Can't think why you haven't written.
Letter 7
Dearest Pippa
Bloody jungle.
It just doesn't give up.
Bloody clouds of flies and biting things and humming whatsits and for the first couple of weeks you think how extraordinary, well it doesn't matter  getting bitten, everyone else is, except Matt with his NASA US-Govt issue personal mosquito repellent and corned-beef face-protector.
But they just go on and on and bloody on.
After a while you just want the Jungle to take a day off.
Go on, Jungle, it's Sunday, knock it off, you want to shout as it rattles on 24 hrs per day.
I don't know.
Maybe it's not the Jungle it's the film.
You can feel the tension mounting.
Matt and me getting edgier with one another off camera as well as on.
The film's all spilling over into the rest of the time.
Even the Indians don't seem so sure that I'm not Firmin all the time and Matt's Antonio.
It's as if they think I'm really Firmin and then from time to time I just pretend to be this white man called Charlie.
Really upside down.
Sunday.
That thing about the Indians.
To tell you the truth I was a bit miffed when I found out, but now I'm beginning to see it from their point of view.
I told you I was learning the language — she's really very sweet and not a stitch on but as I said no need to worry, angel, riddled with diseases I'm sure, apart from anything else, I mean.
It turns out that half the words she's been teaching me are all wrong.
I mean, they're real words except they're not the right ones.
The first thing I learnt more or less was thkarni which means — well she said it meant — this white stork we've been seeing a lot of.
So when we saw one go flapping by I used to shout thkarni and the Indians would all laugh.
Turns out — and I learned this not through Miguel but our second guide who hasn't said much most of the trip — that thkarni is the Indians' name — well, one of their many names, to be precise — for you-know-what.
The thing up which the little fish in the river swims if you aren't careful.
Same goes for about half the words I've been learning from that little minx.
I've learnt about 60 I suppose overall and half of them are duds naughty words or words for something completely different.
I was majorly unpleased as you can imagine at the time but I think what it does show is that the Indians have got a terrific sense of humour.
So I was determined to show them I could take a joke and the next time a big stork went over I pretended not to know what it was called and asked my girl.
Thkarni she said  with a straight face.
I looked very puzzled and shook my head a lot and said No it can't be thkarni because this is thkarni (no I didn't pull it out or anything — just pointed).
And then she knew the game was up and started giggling, and so did I to show there weren't any hard feelings.
Monday.
Getting near the end now.
Just the big scene to do.
Taking two days off first.
I think that's a silly decision by Vic but I expect he's got the unions on his back.
He says it's a good idea to recharge the batteries before the big scene.
I think if you're on a roll you better go with the flow.
It's all right, honey, I don't really talk like that, I do it to irritate Matt, though it usually doesn't because he's so thick-skinned and thinks everyone else talks like that anyway, so I guess I do it for my own private amusement.
‘Hey, Matt,’ I say to him, ‘We're on a roll, let's go with the flow’, and he nods like some old prophet in The Ten Commandments.
Anyway the plan is today and tomorrow off, then two days rehearsal for the capsizing of the raft, then Friday the big deal.
Maybe Vic is right after all, we do need to be at our best.
It's not just doing it right it's covering all the angles.
We've got to have ropes on us as per contract in case anything happens.
Don't worry darling it's not really dangerous.
We're doing some covering footage on a stretch of the river where there are some rapids, but the actual capsizing which is meant to happen there doesn't really.
The crew have got a couple of machines which churn everything up to make white water and the chippie ran up some rocks which they anchor to the bottom of the river and look just like the real thing.
So no need to worry.
I'm quite looking forward to it though naturally we've had a few of the old arguments about it.
What happens is that both the priests get tipped into the water, one of them hits his head on a rock and the other one rescues him.
Point is, who does what?
I mean, here are these two, fighting tooth and nail all the way upstream, there's this huge split of doctrine going on, one of them v. authoritarian and hardline (Me) and the other very permissive and soft on the Indians (Matt).
I think it would be much more effective if the one who was meant to be the hardhat and who might be expected to let the other one drown  in fact saves the other one even though he thinks his ideas about the Indians and his plan to baptise them when they get to the Orinoco are blasphemous.
But no, it has to be Matt who saves me .
Vic says that's what's historically the case, and Matt says that's what was in the script he read back in Dudesville North Dakota or wherever he hangs his hat and that's what he's going to play.
‘Nobody rescues Matt Smeaton,’ he said.
He actually said it, can you imagine?
‘Nobody rescues Matt Smeaton.’
I said I'd remember that if ever I found him dangling upside down by one toe from a ski-lift cable.
So it's all going to go ahead as per the script.
Tuesday.
Another rest day.

Jesus Pippa.
Jesus.
I just couldn't go on with that last letter.
Jolly bits of news from each day's shooting.
Couldn't go on with it, not after what happened.
But I'm fine.
Really I'm fine.
Later.
Poor old Matt.
Shit, he was a good bloke.
Sure he could get under your skin but so would St Francis of Assisi on a job like this.
He'd have spent all his time looking at the bloody birds in the Jungle instead of reading his cue-cards.
Sorry, love.
Bad taste, I know.
Just can't find the way to put things.
Very low.
Poor old Matt.
I wonder how you'll hear the news and what you'll think.
Jesus those fucking Indians.
I think I'm going to die.
I can hardly hold this biro.
Sweating like a pig,comme un porco .
God I do love you, Pippa, I just hold on to that.
Letter 9
I get out your photo with the chipmunk face and kiss it.
That's all that matters, you and me and having babies.
Let's do it, Pippa.
Your mum would be pleased, wouldn't she?
I said to Fish do you have kids, he said yes they're the apple of my eye.
I put my arm round him and gave him a hug just like that.
It's things like that keep everything going, isn't it?
It's true what they say.
Go into the Jungle and you really find out what people are like.
Vic's a whinger, always knew it.
Whingeing on about the sodding film.
I said don't worry you can always sell your memoirs to the paper.
He didn't like that.
Why did they do it?
Why did they do it?

P.S. Wish you'd written.
Would have helped now.
Letter 10
It could have been me.
It could just as easily have been me.
Who decides?
Does anyone decide?
Hey you up there in the sky, is anyone home?
I've been having this thought all day.
I said to Old Fishy do you have kids and he said yes they're the apple of my eye and we just hugged each other right there in front of everyone and ever since I've been wondering what it means.
The apple of my eye.
What does it mean?
You say words like that and everyone knows what they mean but when you look at them you can't understand them.
The film's like that, the whole trip's like that.
You go along thinking you know exactly what everything is, and then you stop and look at it and it doesn't make any sense and you think maybe it only made any sense in the first place because everyone was pretending it did.
Does this make any sense?
I mean it's like the Indians and the fake rocks that the chippie ran  up.
They looked at them and looked at them and the more they did the less they understood.
They started off knowing they were rocks and they ended up not knowing anything.
You could see it in their faces.
I'm going to give this to Rojas now.
He walked past a few minutes ago and said that's the third letter you've written today why don't you put them in the same envelope and save postage?
I got up and you know I swear I turned into Firmin for a moment and I said, ‘Listen, Our Lady of Communications, I shall write and you will transmit as many fucking letters per day as I happen to feel like writing.’
Well Firmin wouldn't have said fuck of course, but his tone was there.
Sort of austere and pissed off with anything less than perfection in the world.
Oh well, better go and say sorry, otherwise he'll throw them all away.

Waiting for copter
Pippa love
When we get out, I'm going to do the following things.
Have the biggest fucking Scotch they can pour in Caracas.
Have the biggest fucking bath they can pour in Caracas.
Have the longest phone call I can have with you.
I can just hear your voice answering the phone, as if I've been to the shop for some ciggies and I'm back late.
Then I'm going to the British Embassy and get a copy of the Daily Telegraph and I don't care if it's weeks old and I'm going to read something I never normally look at like the nature notes if they have them.
I want to be told that the house-martins are nesting or you might see a badger if you're lucky.
Ordinary things that go on all the time.
I'll look at the cricket scores and pretend I'm some old member in from the shires with a striped blazer and a pink gin in his fist.
Maybe I'll  read the births column as well.
To Emma and Nicholas, a daughter, Suzie, sister to Alexander and Bill.
Good old Alexander and Bill, I'll say, now you've got little Suzie to play with.
You must be gentle with her, you must protect her all your lives, she's your little sister, you must make her the apple of your eye.
God I'm crying Pippa, the tears are just streaming down my face.

Letter 12
Caracas 21st July
Pippa love, I don't believe it, I mean I just don't believe it.
We finally reach what we laughingly call civilization, we finally reach a telephone which is capable of handling transatlantic calls, I finally get my turn in the queue, I finally get through to home, and you're out.
‘Number no answer, sir.’
Try again.
‘Number sti no answer, sir.’
Try again.
‘OK sir, number sti no answer.’
Where are you?
I don't want to ring anyone else.
I don't want to ring your mum and say look we had a spot of bother but now we're back in Caracas and Matt's dead, yes, you heard it on the news but I don't want to talk about it.
I just want to talk to you, honey, and I can't.
Tried again.
Tried again.
All right, so I've got a bottle of Scotch which costs about 50 quid and if the studio doesn't pay for it I'll never work for them again, and a big pile of this flimsy hotel notepaper.
The others have gone out on the town.
I couldn't face it.
I keep remembering the last night we were here — same hotel and all — and how Matt and I went out and got stinko-paralytico together and ended up doing the Zorba dance and got thrown out and Matt pointing at me and saying to the waiters Hey don't you  recognize Mista Rick from Parkway Peninsula and they didn't and made us pay for the plates.
We'd had our rest days, just three days work left.
The first morning we rehearsed in the white water, pretty gingerly I don't mind saying.
Vic and the crew were on the bank, Matt and I were on the raft with about a dozen Indians paddling and poling.
Just to be on the safe side we had a long rope attached to the raft and tied round a tree on the bank so that if the Indians lost control the rope would pull it to a stop.
Matt and I had ropes on us as per contract.
So we did a run-through in the morning which was OK, then had an afternoon in the shallows with the churning machine.
I thought we didn't need another day of rehearsal but Vic insisted.
So the second morning we all went out again only this time wearing radio mikes as well.
Vic hadn't decided whether to dub or not.
The rope was attached to the tree, the crew set up on the bank, and we got ready to do three or four runs past the camera with Matt and me so busy arguing about baptising the Indians that we couldn't see the danger behind us which the audience could see for themselves.
I've thought about what happened next a million times and I still don't know the answer.
It was on our third run.
We got the thumbs-up, started our argument and then noticed something odd.
Instead of a dozen Indians on the raft there were only two, each with just a pole at the back of the raft.
I suppose we thought Vic must have said try it this way because Matt and I were already into our quarrel and it shows what a pro he was to his fingertips that he carried on as per normal.
So did I for that matter.
Then at the end of the scene we noticed the Indians weren't doing what they normally did which was stick their poles in to stop the raft.
They were just poling away and Matt shouted ‘Hey, fellers, cut’ but they didn't take any notice and I remember thinking maybe they're testing the rope to see if it works, and Matt and I turned at just the same moment and saw where the Indians were heading us — straight into a pile of rocks and foaming water — and I knew the rope must have broken or something.
We shouted but what with the noise of the water and not knowing their language of course it wasn't any use and  then we were in the water.
I thought of you as we capsized, Pippa, honest I did.
Just saw your face and tried to think about you.
Then I tried swimming, but what with the current and the fucking cassock — and then bang I got hit in the ribs like someone had kicked me and I thought I was a goner, it must be a rock I thought and I gave up and sort of passed out.
What happened was that the rope they'd put on me suddenly pulled tight.
I don't remember anything else until I was on the bank throwing up water and puking in the mud while the sound-man thumped on my back and put his fists in my stomach.
My line held, Matt's line broke.
That's how it was, that's my luck.
Everyone was in shock, as you can imagine.
Some of the crew tried getting along the bank — you know how people are sometimes found clinging to the branches of trees overhanging the river a mile or so downstream.
But it wasn't like that.
That sort of thing is strictly for the movies.
Matt was gone, and anyway the crew couldn't get more than 20 or 30 yards beyond where they'd set up because they don't exactly have towpaths in the Jungle.
‘Why were there only two?’
Vic kept saying.
‘Why only two?’
They looked around for the Indians who'd helped them set up but they weren't there.
Then they went back to camp and the only person there was Miguel the interpreter, who'd been having a long conversation with one of the Indians and when he turned round all the other Indians had scarpered.
Then we went to see what had happened to the rope round the tree and there wasn't anything left, it had just gone.
Which was pretty odd as it was fixed with one of those fancy knots which simply can't pull out.
No doubt as per contract.
Bloody suspicious.
Then we talked to Miguel again and it turned out the Indian had started this long conversation with him before we could possibly have had the accident.
So they presumably knew what was going to happen.
And when we looked in the camp they'd taken everything — clothes, food, equipment.
What did they take the clothes for?
They don't even wear them.
It was a bloody long wait for the copter, I can tell you.
The Indians had taken the radio telephones (they'd have gone off  with the genny if they'd had a crane) and Caracas thought they'd just broken down again so came as per normal.
Two days waiting like two bloody months.
Me thinking I'd probably got some filthy fever in spite of the jabs.
Apparently when they pulled me out of the river and bashed the water out of my belly the first thing I said as I came round was, ‘Riddled with diseases, I'm sure’ and the crew broke up in this hysterical laughter.
Don't remember, but it sounds like Charlie.
Thought I might be in for beri-beri and co.
Ouch in spades, I thought.
Why did they do it?
That's what I keep coming back to.
Why?
Most of the others think they did it because they're primitive — you know, not white men, never trust a native and so on.
That's no go.
I never did think they were primitive and they always told the truth (except when they were teaching me the language) and were a damn sight more trustworthy than some of the white men we had on the job.
The first thing I thought of was that we'd offended them in some way we didn't know — done a terrible insult to their gods or something.
But I simply couldn't think of anything.
The way I'm looking at it, either there's some connection with what happened a couple of hundred years ago or there isn't.
Perhaps it's just a chance coincidence.
It so happens that the descendants of the original Indians whose raft capsized were also in charge of another raft that capsized at about the same point in the river.
Maybe these Indians can only take so much of poling Jesuits upstream and just instinctively snap and turn nasty and shove them overboard.
Not very likely is it?
Or there is some connection between the two incidents.
This is what I think anyway.
It seems to me that the Indians — our Indians — knew what had happened to Father Firmin and Father Antonio all those years ago.
It's the sort of thing that gets handed down as the women are pounding the manioc root or whatever.
Those Jesuits were probably quite big in the Indians' history.
Think of that story getting passed down the generations, each time they handed it on it became more colourful and exaggerated.
And then we come along, another lot of white men who've also got two chaps in long black skirts with them, who also want to be  poled up the river to the Orinoco.
Sure, there are differences, they've got this one-eyed machine and so on, but basically it's the same thing, and we even tell them it's going to end in the same way with the raft capsizing.
I mean, it's hard to think of an equivalent, but say you were an inhabitant of Hastings in the year 2066 and you went down to the beach one day and these longships were coming towards you and lots of people in chainmail and pointy helmets got out and said they'd come for the Battle of Hastings and would you rustle up King Harold so they could shoot him in the eye and here was a huge wallet full of money for you to play your part.
First of all, you might be inclined to do it, wouldn't you?
And then you'd get thinking about why they wanted you to do it.
And one thing you might come up with — this is just my idea, Vic isn't so sure about it — is that they (i.e. us) have come back to re-enact the ceremony for some reason that's tremendously important to their tribes.
Perhaps the Indians thought it was a religious thing, like celebrating the 500th anniversary of a cathedral or whatever.
And there's another possibility — that the Indians were actually following the argument between the Jesuits and understanding it a lot better than we thought.
They Matt and me, that's to say — were arguing about baptising the Indians, and at the point the raft capsized it looked as if I was winning the argument.
I was the senior priest, after all, and I was against baptism — at least until the Indians pulled their socks up and stopped some of their filthy practices.
So maybe the Indians understood this and tipped up the raft because they were trying to kill Father Firmin (me!) so that Father Antonio would survive and baptise them.
How about that?
Except that the first time round the Indians saw that Firmin survived and they ran away because they were afraid, and the second time round they saw they'd killed Antonio, which was quite the wrong result for them so they ran away because it had all gone wrong.
Is that right?
I just know it's more complicated than it's ever going to seem in the newspapers.
I shouldn't be surprised if Hollywood sends a plane to bomb the Indians and punish them for the death of Matt.
Or does a remake — yes, that'd be more  bloody likely.
Who gets the part of Matt?
What a career opportunity.
I ask you.
Seem to be stuck here for a week or so.
That bloody studio and its bloody lawyers.
Apparently the movie has to be officially called off in some way and that takes time.
Taking this down to Our Lady of Communications and expressing it.
Makes a change to be giving it to a real postman.

As you don't seem to be responding to telegrams for reasons best known to yourself, I am writing to say that I am not coming  home immediately.
I need time and space not just to get over the appalling things which have happened to me in which you do not seem to show much interest but also to think through where the two of us are at.
There seems no point in saying that I love you in spite of everything because that only seems to irritate you for reasons best known to yourself and which you choose neither to explain nor comment on.

RETURNING LONDON MONDAY FIFTEENTH STOP KINDLY REMOVE SELF AND POSSESSIONS FROM FLAT BEFORE THEN STOP LEAVE KEY STOP ENDIT STOP   
Parenthesis
Let me tell you something about her.
It's that middle stretch of the night, when the curtains leak no light, the only street-noise is the grizzle of a returning Romeo, and the birds haven't begun their routine yet cheering business.
She's lying on her side, turned away from me.
I can't see her in the dark, but from the hushed swell of her breathing I could draw you the map of her body.
When she's happy she can sleep for hours in the same position.
I've watched over her in all those sewery parts of the night, and can testify that she doesn't move.
It could be just down to good digestion and calm dreams, of course; but I take it as a sign of happiness.
Our nights are different.
She falls asleep like someone yielding to the gentle tug of a warm tide, and floats with confidence till morning.
I fall asleep more grudgingly, thrashing at the waves, either reluctant to let a good day depart or still bitching about a bad one.
Different currents run through our spells of unconsciousness.
Every so often I find myself catapulted out of bed with fear of time and death, panic at the approaching void; feet on the floor, head in hands, I shout a useless (and disappointingly uneloquent)‘No, no,no ’ as I wake.
Then she has to stroke the horror away from me, like sluicing down a dog that's come barking from a dirty river.
Less often, it's her sleep that's broken by a scream, and my turn to move across her in a sweat of protectiveness.
I am starkly awake, and she delivers to me through sleepy lips the cause of her outcry.
‘A very large beetle’, she will say, as if she wouldn't have bothered me about a smaller one; or ‘The steps were slippery’; or merely (which strikes me as cryptic to the point of tautology), ‘Something nasty’.
Then, having expelled this  damp toad, this handful of gutter-muck from her system, she sighs and returns to a purged sleep.
I lie awake, clutching a slimy amphibian, shifting a handful of sodden detritus from hand to hand, alarmed and admiring.
(I'm not claiming grander dreams, by the way.
Sleep democratizes fear.
The terror of a lost shoe or a missed train are as great here as those of guerrilla attack or nuclear war.)
I admire her because she's got this job of sleeping that we all have to do, every night, ceaselessly, until we die, much better worked out than I have.
She handles it like a sophisticated traveller unthreatened by a new airport.
Whereas I lie there in the night with an expired passport, pushing a baggage trolley with a squeaking wheel across to the wrong carousel.
Anyway…she's asleep, turned away from me on her side.
The usual stratagems and repositionings have failed to induce narcosis in me, so I decide to settle myself against the soft zigzag of her body.
As I move and start to nestle my shin against a calf whose muscles are loosened by sleep, she senses what I'm doing, and without waking reaches up with her left hand and pulls the hair off her shoulders on to the top of her head, leaving me her bare nape to nestle in.
Each time she does this I feel a shudder of love at the exactness of this sleeping courtesy.
My eyes prickle with tears, and I have to stop myself from waking her up to remind her of my love.
At that moment, unconsciously, she's touched some secret fulcrum of my feelings for her.
She doesn't know, of course; I've never told her of this tiny, precise pleasure of the night.
Though I'm telling her now, I suppose…
You think she's really awake when she does it?
I suppose it could sound like a conscious courtesy — an agreeable gesture, but hardly one denoting that love has roots below the gum of consciousness.
You're right to be sceptical: we should be indulgent only to a certain point with lovers, whose vanities rival those of politicians.
Still, I can offer further proof.
Her hair falls, you see, to her shoulders.
But a few years ago, when they promised us the summer heat would last for months, she had it cut short.
Her nape was bare for kissing all day long.
And in the dark, when we lay beneath a single sheet and I gave off a  Calabrian sweat, when the middle stretch of the night was shorter but still hard to get through — then, as I turned towards that loose S beside me, she would, with a soft murmur, try to lift the lost hair from the back of her neck.
‘I love you,’ I whisper into that sleeping nape, ‘I love you.’
All novelists know their art proceeds by indirection.
When tempted by didacticism, the writer should imagine a spruce sea-captain eyeing the storm ahead, bustling from instrument to instrument in a catherine wheel of gold braid, expelling crisp orders down the speaking tube.
But there is nobody below decks; the engine-room was never installed, and the rudder broke off centuries ago.
The captain may put on a very good act, convincing not just himself but even some of the passengers; though whether their floating world will come through depends not on him but on the mad winds and sullen tides, the icebergs and the sudden crusts of reef.
Still, it's natural for the novelist sometimes to fret at the obliquities of fiction.
In the lower half of El Greco's ‘Burial of the Count of Orgaz’ in Toledo there is a line-up of angular, ruffed mourners.
They gaze this way and that in stagey grief.
Only one of them looks directly out of the picture, and he holds us with a gloomy, ironical eye — an unflattered eye, as well, we can't help noticing.
Tradition claims that this figure is El Greco himself.
I did this, he says.
I painted this.
I am responsible, and so I face towards you.
Poets seem to write more easily about love than prose writers.
For a start, they own that flexible ‘I’(when I say ‘I’ you will want to know within a paragraph or two whether I mean Julian Barnes or someone invented; a poet can shimmy between the two, getting credit for both deep feeling and objectivity).
Then again, poets seem able to turn bad love — selfish, shitty love into good love poetry.
Prose writers lack this power of admirable, dishonest transformation.
We can only turn bad love into prose about bad love.
So we are envious (and slightly distrustful) when poets talk to us of love.
And they write this stuff called love poetry.
It's collected into books called The Great Lovers' Valentine World Anthology of  Love Poetry or whatever.
Then there are love letters; these are collected into The Golden Quill Treasury of Love Letters (available by mail order).
But there is no genre that answers to the name of love prose.
It sounds awkward, almost self-contradictory.
Love Prose: A Plodder's Handbook.
Look for it in the carpentry section.
The Canadian writer Mavis Gallant put it like this: ‘The mystery of what a couple is , exactly, is almost the only true mystery left to us, and when we have come to the end of it there will be no more need for literature — or for love, for that matter.’
When I first read this, I gave it in the margin the chess marking ‘!?’ indicating a move which, though possibly brilliant, is probably unsound.
But increasingly the view convinces, and the marking is changed to ‘!!’
‘What will survive of us is love.’
This is the cautiously approached conclusion of Philip Larkin's poem ‘An Arundel Tomb’.
The line surprises us, for much of the poet's work was a squeezed flannel of disenchantment.
We are ready to be cheered; but we should first give a  prosy scowl and ask of this poetic flourish, Is it true?
Is love what will survive of us?
It would be nice to think so.
It would be comforting if love were an energy source which continued to glow after our deaths.
Early television sets, when you turned them off, used to leave a blob of light in the middle of the screen, which slowly diminished from the size of a florin to an expiring speck.
As a boy I would watch this process each evening, vaguely wanting to hold it back (and seeing it, with adolescent melancholy, as the pinpoint of human existence fading inexorably in a black universe).
Is love meant to glow on like this for a while after the set has been switched off?
I can't see it myself.
When the survivor of a loving couple dies, love dies too.
If anything survives of us it will probably be something else.
What will survive of Larkin is not his love but his poetry: that's obvious.
And whenever I read the end of ‘An Arundel Tomb’ I'm reminded of William Huskisson.
He was a politician and a financier, well-known in his time; but we remember him today because on the 15th of September 1830, at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, he  became the first person to be run down and killed by a train (that's what he became, was turned into).
And did William Huskisson love?
And did his love last?
We don't know.
All that has survived of him is his moment of final carelessness; death froze him as an instructive cameo about the nature of progress.
‘I love you.’
For a start, we'd better put these words on a high shelf; in a square box behind glass which we have to break with our elbow; in the bank.
We shouldn't leave them lying around the house like a tube of vitamin C. If the words come too easily to hand, we'll use them without thought; we won't be able to resist.
Oh, we say we won't, but we will.
We'll get drunk, or lonely, or — likeliest of all — plain damn hopeful, and there are the words gone, used up, grubbied.
We think we might be in love and we're trying out the words to see if they're appropriate?
How can we know what we think till we hear what we say?
Come off it; that won't wash.
These are grand words; we must make sure we deserve them.
Listen to them again: ‘I love you’.
Subject, verb, object: the unadorned, impregnable sentence.
The subject is a short word, implying the self-effacement of the lover.
The verb is longer but unambiguous, a demonstrative moment as the tongue flicks anxiously away from the palate to release the vowel.
The object, like the subject, has no consonants, and is attained by pushing the lips forward as if for a kiss.
‘I love you’.
How serious, how weighted, how freighted it sounds.
I imagine a phonic conspiracy between the world's languages.
They make a conference decision that the phrase must always sound like something to be earned, to be striven for, to be worthy of.
Ich liebe dich : a late-night, cigarette-voiced whisper, with that happy rhyme of subject and object.
Je t'aime : a different procedure, with the subject and object being got out of the way first, so that the long vowel of adoration can be savoured to the full.
(The grammar is also one of reassurance: with the object positioned second, the beloved isn't suddenly going to turn out to be someone different.)
Ya tebya lyublyu : the object once more in consoling second position, but this time despite the hinting rhyme of subject and object — an implication  of difficulty, obstacles to be overcome.
Ti amo : it sounds perhaps a bit too much like an aperitif, but is full of structural conviction with subject and verb, the doer and the deed, enclosed in the same word.
Forgive the amateur approach.
I'll happily hand the project over to some philanthropic foundation devoted to expanding the sum of human knowledge.
Let them commission a research team to examine the phrase in all the languages of the world, to see how it varies, to discover what its sounds denote to those who hear them, to find out if the measure of happiness changes according to the richness of the phrasing.
A question from the floor: are there tribes whose lexicon lacks the words I love you?
Or have they all died out?
We must keep these words in their box behind glass.
And when we take them out we must be careful with them.
Men will say ‘I love you’ to get women into bed with them; women will say ‘I love you’to get men into marriage with them; both will say ‘I love you’to keep fear at bay, to convince themselves of the deed by the word, to assure themselves that the promised condition has arrived, to deceive themselves that it hasn't yet gone away.
We must beware of such uses.
I love you shouldn't go out into the world, become a currency, a traded share, make profits for us.
It will do that if we let it.
But keep this biddable phrase for whispering into a nape from which the absent hair has just been swept.
I'm away from her at the moment; perhaps you guessed.
The transatlantic telephone gives off a mocking, heard-it-all-before echo.
‘I love you’, and before she can answer I hear my metallic other self respond, ‘I love you.’
This isn't satisfactory; the echoing words have gone public.
I try again, with the same result.
I love you I love you — it's become some trilling song popular for a lurid month and then dismissed to the club circuit where pudgy rockers with grease in their hair and yearning in their voice will use it to unfrock the lolling front-row girls.
I love you I love you while the lead guitar giggles and the drummer's tongue lies wetly in his opened mouth.
We must be precise with love, its language and its gestures.
If it is to save us, we must look at it as clearly as we should learn to look at death.
Should love be taught in school?
First term: friendship; second term: tenderness; third term: passion.
Why not?
They teach kids how to cook and mend cars and fuck one another without getting pregnant; and the kids are, we assume, much better at all of this than we were, but what use is any of that to them if they don't know about love?
They're expected to muddle through by themselves.
Nature is supposed to take over, like the automatic pilot on an aeroplane.
Yet Nature, on to whom we pitch responsibility for all we cannot understand, isn't very good when set to automatic.
Trusting virgins drafted into marriage never found Nature had all the answers when they turned out the light.
Trusting virgins were told that love was the promised land, an ark on which two might escape the Flood.
It may be an ark, but one on which anthropophagy is rife; an ark skippered by some crazy greybeard who beats you round the head with his gopher-wood stave, and might pitch you overboard at any moment.
Let's start at the beginning.
Love makes you happy?
No.
Love makes the person you love happy?
No.
Love makes everything all right?
Indeed no.
I used to believe all this, of course.
Who hasn't (who doesn't still, somewhere below decks in the psyche)?
It's in all our books, our films; it's the sunset of a thousand stories.
What would love be for if it didn't solve everything?
Surely we can deduce from the very strength of our aspiration that love, once achieved, eases the daily ache, works some effortless analgesia?
A couple love each other, but they aren't happy.
What do we conclude?
That one of them doesn't really love the other; that they love one another a certain amount but not enough?
I dispute that really; I dispute that enough .
I've loved twice in my life (which seems quite a lot to me), once happily, once unhappily.
It was the unhappy love that taught me most about love's nature — though not at the time, not until years later.
Dates and details — fill them in as you like.
But I was in love, and loved, for a long time, many years.
At first I was brazenly happy, bullish with solipsistic joy; yet most of the time I was  puzzlingly, naggingly unhappy.
Didn't I love her enough?
I knew I did — and put off half my future for her.
Didn't she love me enough?
I knew she did — and gave up half her past for me.
We lived side by side for many years, fretting at what was wrong with the equation we had invented.
Mutual love did not add up to happiness.
Stubbornly, we insisted that it did.
And later I decided what it was I believed about love.
We think of it as an active force.
My love makes her happy; her love makes me happy: how could this be wrong?
It is wrong; it evokes a false conceptual model.
It implies that love is a transforming wand, one that unlooses the ravelled knot, fills the top hat with handkerchiefs, sprays the air with doves.
But the model isn't from magic but particle physics.
My love does not, cannot make her happy; my love can only release in her the capacity to be happy.
And now things seem more understandable.
How come I can't make her happy, how come she can't make me happy?
Simple: the atomic reaction you expect isn't taking place, the beam with which you are bombarding the particles is on the wrong wavelength.
But love isn't an atomic bomb, so let's take a homelier comparison.
I'm writing this at the home of a friend in Michigan.
It's a normal American house with all the gadgets technology can dream (except a gadget for making happiness).
He drove me here from Detroit airport yesterday.
As we turned into the driveway he reached into the glove pocket for a remote-control device; at a masterful touch, the garage doors rolled up and away.
This is the model I propose.
You are arriving home — or think you are — and as you approach the garage you try to work your routine magic.
Nothing happens; the doors remain closed.
You do it again.
Again nothing.
At first puzzled, then anxious, then furious with disbelief, you sit in the driveway with the engine running; you sit there for weeks, months, for years, waiting for the doors to open.
But you are in the wrong car, in front of the wrong garage, waiting outside the wrong house.
One of the troubles is this: the heart isn't heart-shaped.
‘We must love one another or die’, wrote W. H. Auden, bringing from E. M. Forster the declaration: ‘Because he once wrote ‘We must love one another or die’, he can command me to follow him.’
Auden, however, was dissatisfied with this famous line from ‘September 1, 1939’.
‘That's a damned lie!’ he commented, ‘We must die anyway.’
So when reprinting the poem he altered the line to the more logical ‘We must love one another and die’.
Later he suppressed it altogether.
This shift from or to and is one of poetry's most famous emendations.
When I first came across it, I applauded the honest rigour with which Auden the critic revised Auden the poet.
If a line sounds ringingly good but isn't true, out with it — such an approach is bracingly free of writerly self-infatuation.
Now I am not so sure.
We must love one another and die certainly has logic on its side; it's also about as interesting on the subject of the human condition, and as striking, as We must listen to the radio and die or We must remember to defrost the fridge and die .
Auden was rightly suspicious of his own rhetoric; but to say that the line We must love one another or die is untrue because we die anyway (or because those who do not love do not instantly expire) is to take a narrow or forgetful view.
There are equally logical, and more persuasive, ways of reading the or line.
The first, obvious one is this: we must love one another because if we don't we are liable to end up killing one another.
The second is: we must love one another because if we don't, if love doesn't fuel our lives, then we might as well be dead.
This, surely, is no ‘damned lie’, to claim that those who get their deepest satisfactions from other things are living empty lives, are posturing crabs who swagger the sea-bed in borrowed shells.
This is difficult territory.
We must be precise, and we mustn't become sentimental.
If we are to oppose love to such wily, muscled concepts as power, money, history and death, then we mustn't retreat into self-celebration or snobby vagueness.
Love's enemies profit from its unspecific claims, its grand capacity for isolationism So where do we start?
Love may or may not produce happiness; whether or not it does in the end, its primary effect is to energize.
Have you ever talked so well, needed less sleep, returned to sex so eagerly, as when you were  first in love?
The anaemic begin to glow, while the normally healthy become intolerable.
Next, it gives spine-stretching confidence.
You feel you are standing up straight for the first time in your life; you can do anything while this feeling lasts, you can take on the world.
(Shall we make this distinction: that love enhances the confidence, whereas sexual conquest merely develops the ego?)
Then again, it gives clarity of vision: it's a windscreen wiper across the eyeball.
Have you ever seen things so clearly as when you were first in love?
If we look at nature, do we see where love comes in?
Not really.
There are occasional species which apparently mate for life (though imagine the opportunities for adultery on all those long-distance migratory swims and night flights); but on the whole we see merely the exercise of power, dominance and sexual convenience.
The feminist and the chauvinist interpret Nature differently.
The feminist looks for examples of disinterested behaviour in the animal kingdom, sees the male here and there performing tasks which in human society might be characterized as ‘female’.
Consider the king penguin: the male is the one that incubates the egg, carrying it around on its feet and protecting it for months from the Antarctic weather with a fold of its lower belly…
Yeah, replies the chauvinist, and what about the bull elephant seal?
Just lies about on the beach all day and fucks every female in sight.
It does regrettably seem true that the seal's behaviour is more standard than that of the male penguin.
And knowing my sex as I do, I'm inclined to doubt the latter's motivation.
The male penguin might just have calculated that if you're stuck in the Antarctic for years on end then the cleverest thing to do is stay at home minding the egg while you send the female off to catch fish in the freezing waters.
He might just have worked things out to his own convenience.
So where does love come in?
It's not strictly necessary, is it?
We can build dams, like the beaver, without love.
We can organize complex societies, like the bee, without love.
We can travel long distances, like the albatross, without love.
We can put our head in the sand, like the ostrich, without love.
We can die out as a species, like the dodo, without love.
Is it a useful mutation that helps the race survive?
I can't see it.
Was love implanted, for instance, so that warriors would fight harder for their lives, bearing deep inside them the candlelit memory of the domestic hearth?
Hardly: the history of the world teaches us that it is the new form of arrowhead, the canny general, the full stomach and the prospect of plunder that are the decisive factors in war, rather than sentimental minds drooling about home.
Then is love some luxury that sprang up in peaceful times, like quilt-making?
Something pleasant, complex, but inessential?
A random development, culturally reinforced, which just happens to be love rather than something else?
I sometimes think so.
There was once a tribe of Indians in the far north-west of the United States (I'm not inventing them), who lived an extraordinarily easy life.
They were protected from enemies by their isolation and the land they cultivated was boundlessly fertile.
They only had to drop a wizened bean over their shoulders for a plant to spurt from the ground and rain pods at them.
They were healthy, content, and had failed to develop any taste for internecine warfare.
As a result, they had a lot of time on their hands.
No doubt they excelled at things in which indolent societies specialize; no doubt their basketwork became rococo, their erotic skills more gymnastical, their use of crushed leaves to induce stupefying trances increasingly efficient.
We don't know about such aspects of their lives, but we do know what was the main pursuit of their generous leisure hours.
They stole from one another.
That's what they liked to do, and that's what they celebrated.
As they staggered out of their tepees and another faultless day came smooching in from the Pacific, they would sniff the honeyed air and ask one another what they'd got up to the previous night.
The answer would be a shy confession — or smug boast — of theft.
Old Redface had his blanket pilfered again by Little Grey Wolf.
Well, did you ever?
He's coming along, that Little Grey Wolf.
And what did you get up to?
Me?
Oh, I just snitched the eyebrows from the top of the totem-pole.
Oh, not that one again.
Bo- ring .
Is this how we should think of love?
Our love doesn't help us  survive, any more than did the Indians' thieving.
Yet it gives us our individuality, our purpose.
Take away their joyful larcenies and those Indians would be able to define themselves less easily.
So is it just a rogue mutation?
We don't need it for the expansion of our race; indeed, it's inimical to orderly civilization.
Sexual desire would be much easier if we didn't have to worry about love.
Marriage would be more straightforward and perhaps most lasting — if we were not itchy for love, exultant on its arrival, fearful of its departure.
If we look at the history of the world, it seems surprising that love is included.
It's an excrescence, a monstrosity, some tardy addition to the agenda.
It reminds me of those half-houses which according to normal criteria of map reading shouldn't exist.
The other week I went to this North American address: 2041½ Yonge Street.
The owner of 2041 must at some point have sold off a little plot, and this half-numbered, half-acknowledged house was put up.
And yet people can live in it quite comfortably, people call it home…
Tertullian said of Christian belief that it was true because it was impossible.
Perhaps love is essential because it's unnecessary.
She is the centre of my world.
The Armenians believed that Ararat was the centre of the world; but the mountain was divided between three great empires, and the Armenians ended up with none of it, so I shan't continue this comparison.
I love you .
I'm home again, and there's no mocking echo on the words.
Je t'aime .
Ti amo (with soda).
And if you had no tongue, no celebrating language, you'd do this: cross your hands at the wrist with palms facing towards you; place your crossed wrists over your heart (the middle of your chest, anyway); then move your hands outwards a short distance, and open them towards the object of your love.
It's just as eloquent as speech.
And imagine all the tender modulations that are possible, the subtleties that can be constructed from kissing knuckles, matching palms and playful fingertips whose whorled pads bear the proof of our individuality.
But matching palms mislead.
The heart isn't heart-shaped, that's one of our problems.
We imagine, don't we, some neat  bivalve whose shape encodes the way in which love fuses two halves, two separatenesses, into a whole?
We imagine this crisp symbol scarlet with a powerful blush, scarlet also with the blood of tumescence.
A medical textbook doesn't immediately disenchant us; here the heart is mapped like the London Underground.
Aorta, left and right pulmonary arteria and veins, left and right subclavian arteries, left and right coronary arteries, left and right carotid arteries…it looks elegant, purposeful, a confident network of pumping tubes.
Here the blood runs on time, you think.
 Reverberant facts:
— the heart is the first organ to develop in the embryo; when we are no more than the size of a kidney bean, our heart is visible, pumping away;
— in a child, the heart is proportionately much larger than in an adult: th; of total body weight, as opposed to th;;
— during life the size, shape and position of the heart are subject to considerable variations;
— after death the heart assumes the shape of a pyramid.
The ox heart I bought at Corrigans weighed 2lbs 13oz and cost £2.42p.
The biggest available animal specimen; but also one with human application.
‘He had the heart of an ox’: a phrase from the literature of Empire, of adventure, of childhood.
Those pith-helmeted cavaliers who despatched rhinos with a single well-placed slug from an army pistol while the colonel's daughter cowered behind the baobab had simple natures but not, if this ox was anything to go by, simple hearts.
The organ was heavy, squat, bloody, clamped tight like a violent fist.
Unlike the railway map in the textbook, the real thing proved close and reluctant with its secrets.
I sliced it up with a radiologist friend.
‘It hadn't got long to go, this ox,’ she commented.
Had the heart belonged to one of her patients, he wouldn't have pangaed his way through many more jungles.
Our own small journey was effected with a Sabatier kitchen knife.
We hacked our way into the left atrium  and left ventricle, admiring the porterhouse heft of the muscles.
We stroked the silky Rue de Rivoli lining, poked our fingers into exit wounds.
The veins were stretch elastic, the arteries chunky squid.
A post-mortal blood clot lay like a burgundy slug in the left ventricle.
We frequently lost our way in this compacted meat.
The two halves of the heart did not ease apart as I'd fancifully imagined, but clung desperately round one another like drowning lovers.
We cut into the same ventricle twice, believing we'd found the other one.
We admired the clever valve system, and the chordae tendineae which restrain each valve from opening too far: a tough little parachute harness preventing over-deployment of the canopy.
After we'd finished with it, the heart lay on a stained bed of newspaper for the rest of the day, reduced to an unpromising dinner.
I went through cookbooks to see what I might do with it.
I did find one recipe, for stuffed heart served with boiled rice and wedges of lemon, but it didn't sound very inviting.
It certainly didn't merit the name given it by the Danes, who invented it.
They call this dish Passionate Love.
Do you remember that paradox of love, of the first few weeks and months of Passionate Love (it's capitalized, like the recipe, to begin with)— the paradox about time?
You are in love, at a point where pride and apprehension scuffle within you.
Part of you wants time to slow down: for this, you say to yourself, is the best period of your whole life.
I am in love, I want to savour it, study it, lie around in languor with it; may today last forever.
This is your poetical side.
However, there is also your prose side, which urges time not to slow down but hurry up.
How do you know this is love, your prose side whispers like a sceptical lawyer, it's only been around for a few weeks, a few months.
You won't know it's the real thing unless you (and she) still feel the same in, oh, a year or so at least; that's the only way to prove you aren't living a dragonfly mistake.
Get through this bit, however much you enjoy it, as fast as possible; then you'll be able to find out whether or not you're really in love.
A photograph develops in a tray of liquid.
Previously it's been just a blank sheet of printing paper shut up in a lightproof  envelope; now it has a function, an image, a certainty.
We slide the photo quickly into the tray of fixer to secure that clear, vulnerable moment, to make the image harder, unchippable, solid for at least a few years.
But what if you plunge it into the fixer and the chemical doesn't work?
This progress, this amorous motion you feel, might refuse to stabilize.
Have you seen a picture go on relentlessly developing until its whole surface is black, its celebratory moment obliterated?
Is it normal, this state of love, or abnormal?
Statistically, of course, it's abnormal.
In a wedding photograph, the interesting faces are not those of the bride and groom, but of the encircling guests: the bride's younger sister (will it happen to me, the tremendous thing?), the groom's elder brother (will she let him down like that bitch did me?), the bride's mother (how it takes me back), the groom's father (if the lad knew what I know now if only I'd known what I know now), the priest (strange how even the tongue-tied are moved to eloquence by these ancient vows), the scowling adolescent (what do they want to get married for?), and so on.
The central couple are in a profoundly abnormal state; yet try telling them that.
Their condition feels more normal than it has ever done before.
This is normal, they say to one another; all that time before, which we thought was normal, wasn't normal at all .
And such conviction of normality, such certainty that their essence has been developed and fixed by love, and is now to be framed forever, gives them a touching arrogance.
This is definitely abnormal: when else is arrogance touching?
It is here.
Look at the photo again: study, beneath the happy dentition, the serious self-satisfaction of the moment.
How can you not be moved?
Couples noisy with their love (for nobody has ever loved before — not properly — have they?) may irritate, but can't be mocked.
Even when there's something to make an emotional conformist smirk — some thumping disparity of age, looks, education, pretension — the couple have for this moment a lacquer finish: laughter's bubbling spittle simply wipes off.
The young man on the older woman's arm, the frump attached to the dandy, the hostess chained to an ascetic: they all feel profoundly  normal.
And this should move us.
They will be feeling indulgent towards us, because we are not so evidently, so rowdily in love; yet we should be discreetly indulgent towards them.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not recommending one form of love over another.
I don't know if prudent or reckless love is the better, moneyed or penniless love the surer, heterosexual or homosexual love the sexier, married or unmarried love the stronger.
I may be tempted towards didacticism, but this isn't an advice column.
I can't tell you whether or not you're in love.
If you need to ask, then you probably aren't, that's my only advice (and even this might be wrong).
I can't tell you who to love, or how to love: those school courses would be how-not-not-to as much as how-to classes (it's like creative writing — you can't teach them how to write or what to write, only usefully point out where they're going wrong and save them time).
But I can tell you why to love.
Because the history of the world, which only stops at the half-house of love to bulldoze it into rubble, is ridiculous without it.
The history of the world becomes brutally self-important without love.
Our random mutation is essential because it is unnecessary.
Love won't change the history of the world (that nonsense about Cleopatra's nose is strictly for sentimentalists), but it will do something much more important: teach us to stand up to history, to ignore its chin-out strut.
I don't accept your terms, love says; sorry, you don't impress, and by the way what a silly uniform you're wearing.
Of course, we don't fall in love to help out with the world's ego problem; yet this is one of love's surer effects.
Love and truth, that's the vital connection, love and truth.
Have you ever told so much truth as when you were first in love?
Have you ever seen the world so clearly?
Love makes us see the truth, makes it our duty to tell the truth.
Lying in bed: listen to the undertow of warning in that phrase.
Lying in bed, we tell the truth : it sounds like a paradoxical sentence from a first-year philosophy primer.
But it's more (and less) than that: a description of moral duty.
Don't roll that eyeball, give a flattering groan, fake that orgasm.
Tell the truth with your body even if— especially if — that truth is not melodramatic.
Bed is one of the  prime places where you can lie without getting caught, where you can holler and grunt in the dark and later boast about your ‘performance’.
Sex isn't acting (however much we admire our own script); sex is about truth.
How you cuddle in the dark governs how you see the history of the world.
It's as simple as that.
We get scared by history; we allow ourselves to be bullied by data.
In fourteen hundred and ninety-two Columbus sailed the ocean blue
And then what?
Everyone became wiser?
People stopped building new ghettoes in which to practise the old persecutions?
Stopped making the old mistakes, or new mistakes, or new versions of old mistakes?
(And does history repeat itself, the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce?
No, that's too grand, too considered a process.
History just burps, and we taste again that raw-onion sandwich it swallowed centuries ago.)
Dates don't tell the truth.
They bawl at us — left, right, left, right, pick 'em up there you miserable shower.
They want to make us think we're always progressing, always going forward.
But what happened after 1492?
In fourteen hundred and ninety-three He sailed right back across the sea
That's the sort of date I like.
Let's celebrate 1493, not 1492; the return, not the discovery.
What happened in 1493?
The predictable glory, of course, the royal flattery, the heraldic promotions on the Columbus scutcheon.
But there was also this.
Before departure a prize of 10,000 maravedis had been promised to the first man to sight the New World.
An ordinary sailor had won this bounty, yet when the expedition returned Columbus claimed it for himself (the dove still elbowing the raven from history).
The sailor went off in disappointment to  Morocco where, they say, he became a renegade.
It was an interesting year, 1493.
History isn't what happened.
History is just what historians tell us.
There was a pattern, a plan, a movement, expansion, the march of democracy; it is a tapestry, a flow of events, a complex narrative, connected, explicable.
One good story leads to another.
First it was kings and archbishops with some offstage divine tinkering, then it was the march of ideas and the movements of masses, then little local events which mean something bigger, but all the time it's connections, progress, meaning, this led to this, this happened because of this.
And we, the readers of history, the sufferers from history, we scan the pattern for hopeful conclusions, for the way ahead.
And we cling to history as a series of salon pictures, conversation pieces whose participants we can easily reimagine back into life, when all the time it's more like a multi-media collage, with paint applied by decorator's roller rather than camel-hair brush.
The history of the world?
Just voices echoing in the dark; images that burn for a few centuries and then fade; stories, old stories that sometimes seem to overlap; strange links, impertinent connections.
We lie here in our hospital bed of the present (what nice clean sheets we get nowadays) with a bubble of daily news drip-fed into our arm.
We think we know who we are, though we don't quite know why we're here, or how long we shall be forced to stay.
And while we fret and writhe in bandaged uncertainty — are we a voluntary patient?— we fabulate.
We make up a story to cover the facts we don't know or can't accept; we keep a few true facts and spin a new story round them.
Our panic and our pain are only eased by soothing fabulation; we call it history.
There's one thing I'll say for history.
It's very good at finding things.
We try to cover them up, but history doesn't let go.
It's got time on its side, time and science.
However ferociously we ink over our first thoughts, history finds a way of reading them.
We bury our victims in secrecy (strangled princelings, irradiated reindeer), but history discovers what we did to them.
We lost the Titanic , forever it seemed, in the squid-ink depths, but  they turned it up.
They found the wreck of the Medusa not long ago, off the coast of Mauretania.
There wasn't any hope of treasure, they knew that; and all they salvaged after a hundred and seventy five years were a few copper nails from the frigate's hull and a couple of cannon.
But they went and found it just the same.
What else can love do?
If we're selling it, we'd better point out that it's a starting-point for civic virtue.
You can't love someone without imaginative sympathy, without beginning to see the world from another point of view.
You can't be a good lover, a good artist or a good politician without this capacity (you can get away with it, but that's not what I mean).
Show me the tyrants who have been great lovers.
By which I don't mean great fuckers; we all know about power as an aphrodisiac (an auto-aphrodisiac too).
Even our democratic hero Kennedy serviced women like an assembly-line worker spraying car bodies.
There is an intermittent debate, in these last dying millennia of puritanism, about the connection between sexual orthodoxy and the exercise of power.
If a President can't keep his pants on, does he lose the right to rule us?
If a public servant cheats on his wife does this make him more likely to cheat on the electorate?
For myself, I'd rather be ruled by an adulterer, by some sexual rogue, than by a prim celibate or zipped-up spouse.
As criminals tend to specialize in certain crimes, so corrupt politicians normally specialize in their corruption: the sexual blackguards stick to fucking, the bribe-takers to graft.
In which case it would make more sense to elect proven adulterers instead of discouraging them from public life.
I don't say we should pardon them — on the contrary, we need to fan their guilt.
But by harnessing this useful emotion we restrict their sinning to the erotic sphere, and produce a countervailing integrity in their governing.
That's my theory, anyway.
In Great Britain, where most of the politicians are men, there's a tradition among the Conservative Party to interview the wives of potential candidates.
This is, of course, a demeaning occasion, with the wife being vetted by the local members  for normality.
(Is she sane?
Is she steady?
Is she the right colour?
Does she have sound views?
Is she a tart?
Will she look good in photos?
Can we let her out canvassing?)
They ask these wives, who dutifully vie with one another in supportive dullness, many questions, and the wives solemnly swear their joint commitment to nuclear weapons and the sanctity of the family.
But they don't ask them the most important question: does your husband love you?
The question shouldn't be misunderstood as being merely practical (is your marriage free from scandal?) or sentimental; it's an exact enquiry about the candidate's fitness to represent other people.
It's a test of his imaginative sympathy.
We must be precise about love.
Ah, you want descriptions, perhaps?
What are her legs like, her breasts, her lips, what colour is that hair?
(Well, sorry.)
No, being precise about love means attending to the heart, its pulses, its certainties, its truth, its power — and its imperfections.
After death the heart becomes a pyramid (it has always been one of the wonders of the world); but even in life the heart was never heart-shaped.
Put the heart beside the brain and see the difference.
The brain is neat, segmented, divided into two halves as we imagine the heart should obviously be.
You can deal with the brain, you think; it is a receptive organ, one that invites comprehension.
The brain looks sensible.
It's complicated, to be sure, with all those wrinkles and frowns and gulleys and pockets; it resembles coral, making you wonder if it might be surreptitiously on the move all the time, quietly adding to itself without your noticing.
The brain has its secrets, though when cryptanalysts, maze-builders and surgeons unite, it will surely be possible to solve those mysteries.
You can deal with the brain, as I say; it looks sensible.
Whereas the heart, the human heart, I'm afraid, looks a fucking mess.
Love is anti-mechanical, anti-materialist: that's why bad love is still good love.
It may make us unhappy, but it insists that the mechanical and the material needn't be in charge.
Religion has become either wimpishly workaday, or terminally crazy, or merely businesslike — confusing spirituality with charitable donations.
Art, picking up confidence from the decline of  religion, announces its transcendence of the world (and it lasts, it lasts! art beats death!), but this announcement isn't accessible to all, or where accessible isn't always inspiring or welcome.
So religion and art must yield to love.
It gives us our humanity, and also our mysticism.
There is more to us than us.
The materialist argument attacks love, of course; it attacks everything.
Love boils down to pheromones, it says.
This bounding of the heart, this clarity of vision, this energizing, this moral certainty, this exaltation, this civic virtue, this murmured I love you , are all caused by a low-level smell emitted by one partner and subconsciously nosed by the other.
We are just a grander version of that beetle bashing its head in a box at the sound of a tapped pencil.
Do we believe this?
Well, let's believe it for the moment, because it makes love's triumph the greater.
What is a violin made of?
Bits of wood and bits of sheep's intestine.
Does its construction demean and banalize the music?
On the contrary, it exalts the music further.
And I'm not saying love will make you happy — above all, I'm not saying that.
If anything, I tend to believe that it will make you unhappy: either immediately unhappy, as you are impaled by incompatibility, or unhappy later, when the woodworm has quietly been gnawing away for years and the bishop's throne collapses.
But you can believe this and still insist that love is our only hope.
It's our only hope even if it fails us, although it fails us, because it fails us.
Am I losing precision?
What I'm searching for is the right comparison.
Love and truth, yes, that's the prime connection.
We all know objective truth is not obtainable, that when some event occurs we shall have a multiplicity of subjective truths which we assess and then fabulate into history, into some God-eyed version of what ‘really’ happened.
This God-eyed version is a fake — a charming, impossible fake, like those medieval paintings which show all the stages of Christ's Passion happening simultaneously in different parts of the picture.
But while we know this, we must still believe that objective truth is obtainable; or we must believe that it is 99 per cent obtainable; or if we can't believe this we must believe that  43 per cent objective truth is better than 41 per cent.
We must do so, because if we don't we're lost, we fall into beguiling relativity, we value one liar's version as much as another liar's, we throw up our hands at the puzzle of it all, we admit that the victor has the right not just to the spoils but also to the truth.
(Whose truth do we prefer, by the way, the victor's or the victim's?
Are pride and compassion greater distorters than shame and fear?)
And so it is with love.
We must believe in it, or we're lost.
We may not obtain it, or we may obtain it and find it renders us unhappy; we must still believe in it.
If we don't, then we merely surrender to the history of the world and to someone else's truth.
It will go wrong, this love; it probably will.
That contorted organ, like the lump of ox meat, is devious and enclosed.
Our current model for the universe is entropy, which at the daily level translates as: things fuck up.
But when love fails us, we must still go on believing in it.
Is it encoded in every molecule that things fuck up, that love will fail?
Perhaps it is.
Still we must believe in love, just as we must believe in free will and objective truth.
And when love fails, we should blame the history of the world.
If only it had left us alone, we could have been happy, we could have gone on being happy.
Our love has gone, and it is the fault of the history of the world.
But that's still to come.
Perhaps it will never come.
In the night the world can be defied.
Yes, that's right, it can be done, we can face history down.
Excited, I stir and kick.
She shifts and gives a subterranean, a subaqueous sigh.
Don't wake her.
It seems a grand truth now, though in the morning it may not seem worth disturbing her for.
She gives a gentler, lesser sigh.
I sense the map of her body beside me in the dark.
I turn on my side, make a parallel zigzag, and wait for sleep.

‘The greatest man in England, except Lord Mansfield’
THEY HAD STOPPED IN ARBROATH, to view the Abbey.
‘I should scarcely have regretted my journey,’ claimed Johnson, ‘had it afforded nothing more than the sight of Aberbrothick.’
The cobbled forecourt has been defiled with intimidating NO PARKING notices, a mote in the eye of the Abbey's red calm.
Inside, peace reigns, even in driving rain.
Johnson found it full of weeds; today it is tailored and fitted.
A close lawn laps the feet of the giant church's ancient heights, and some of the long-departed community's living quarters are as smoothly preserved as an abbot's jowls.
All such buildings resemble huge ships, the gaping walls like spars awaiting rigging.
Arbroath's south transept even looks as if it has smelt the wind under which it will sail; it is a tall, bare, one-shouldered hulk with a single blank eye at the high gable top where a rose window used to be.
The guidebook, which speaks of lancets, arcades and cusps, says the locals call the eyeless window, with tautological logic, ‘the round O’.
Flemish illuminations in the abbot's house, now a museum, recall the teeming peasantry of Avercamp and Breughel paintings.
On Christmas Eve, 1950, nationalists stole the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey and laid it in the grounds of Arbroath Abbey.
In their protest they sought to restore some political coals to Newcastle: the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320 committed the lay and ecclesiastical nobles of Scotland to support Robert Bruce, who stood against proud Edward's army, and sent him homeward to think again.
Always touch the walls of an old abbey — for the currents of  ancient idea coming through from learned men, and for the systems that housed them.
Arbroath's walls offer a well-groomed feel, powdered silk, which must have as much to do with the history of the place as with Historic Scotland's care.
The Abbey was dedicated to the dead Thomas à Becket by William the Lion, King of Scotland, in thanks for the Canterbury saint's supernatural rescue of William from enemies at Alnwick.
The air in these places must be invisibly thick with the old sounds of monks, and their thoughts, and their cloistered politics.
Arbroath was founded in 1178 by an order descended from Abbot Bernard who left Poitiers for Tiron; monks from this Benedictine reform group of Tironensians established Kelso down on the Borders, and two friars came thence to Arbroath.
Did those scribes care for their hands, tend their fingers, in the way classical musicians are reputed to?
If so, would that have been vanity to the point of sin — or merely preserving the Lord's gift?
Did they get excited when a new supply of lapis lazuli came in from Afghanistan?
Who among them caught the badgers and squirrels from which they made their fine paint brushes?
Did the women of the locality — and/or the imagination — constitute a perennial problem?
Perhaps only if you did not have power: Beaton from St Andrews came to Arbroath in 1524: the Abbey contributed to the lifestyle and wellbeing of his mistress, a fecund Miss Ogilvy, and their seven bastards.
The restorers have thoughtfully provided viewing platforms from which to contemplate the fabric of Arbroath, and search for such things as a volute capital, or a corbel; the guide-book mentions an ‘aumbry in the west wall’: it must mean ‘ambry’, a small cupboard, or closet.
In the life-givingness of words, Architecture and Building possess the loveliest vocabularies: chamfer, aedicule, caryatid, quoin, hammerbeam, oriel, newel, mandorla, garth — a music unto itself.
The Arbroath guidebook's glossary has some of these —‘clearstorey: the range of windows in the upper part of a building; Frater: a monastic refectory or dining hall [alas not taken from the Latin for ‘brother’, but from a French reduction of ‘refreshment']; Gablet: a decorative design in the form of a small gable, often above a window; Pend: a vaulted passageway [several pends in St Andrews]; Slype: a passage; Triforium: the arcaded  gallery between the main arcade and clearstorey; Tympanum: the enclosed space within the head of an arched doorway [does that mean it has a space behind like a drumhead — an open space inviting impressions to be made upon it?]’
And always listen to old walls.
Creatures may live within —; small birds, ticking beetles, crickets: no cheeping, nor any active sounds here, just the passive sound of silence.
All is not lost — old walls appeal to four of the five senses, taste alone being inadvisable.
Their antique regularity, the sense that the insides of those outer courses were last touched by human hand eight hundred years ago, reads like a time-travelling adventure story.
They smell of dry dampness, not a readily marketable perfume in the salons of Europe, but an affirming odour, not of sanctity, nor of history — more of the earth, of the quarries from which they were hewn, to be shaped by men who could cut stone as other monks cut the cloth for their grey robes.
Touch, definitely, brings the most rewards: these walls handle like human beings, inviting those with a weakness for the elegiac to enjoy them, and continue rubbing a hand along them.
Johnson wrote to Mrs Thrale that however ruined he found it, the Abbey's ‘fabrick was once of great extent, and stupendous magnificence’.
He may have meant the general composition of what had been the whole great building: who is to say that he did not also intend the look, smell, feel and silence of these stones?
It becomes easy to picture himself and Boswell here, their servant outside holding the horse's head, while Johnson's taxi, his post-chaise, waited: ‘The arch of one of the gates is entire, and another only so far dilapidated as to diversify the appearance,; Sam himself with his famous stick prodding in the weeds, gauging the cut of the stone as he might examine the shoulders of a friend's new frock-coat, measuring distances, tracing nave, crossing, choir, transept — inhaling meaning and implication, and converting it into judgment and knowledge.
How noble these pillars, and how good for the imagination.
Sometimes, people in ancient places, in flashes of paranormal imagination, see once again the Forum in Pompeii as it must have been a few days before Mount Etna's eruption; or — was it Freud's or Jung's story?— musicians in a Rhenish Schloss, playing  clavichords for a duke and his family.
‘Its ruins,’ said Johnson of Arbroath, ‘afford ample testimony of its ancient magnificence.’
The twelfth abbot, according to the guidebook, was the subject of complaints to the Pope, that he had treated his flock, ‘not like a gentle shepherd, but like a ravening wolf, harrying it ‘with the stings of affliction, and the bites of persecution’, bestowing its property upon his kinsfolk and driving from the monastery those who dared to oppose him'.
How it rained in Arbroath; trying to see through curtains of falling water makes a nonsense of note-taking.
Yet, Boswell must have written on the hoof, and in fat detail — a diligence requiring either unstoppable ambition, and an almost morbid discipline — or both.
The Life of Johnson makes plain how Boswell had been staking out the ground since their early acquaintance, making notes immediately after each meeting of what he himself was eventually to ‘consider the peculiar value’ of the Life, ‘that is, the quantity it contains of Johnson's conversation’.
In September 1764, eighteen months after they first met, Boswell told Johnson in a letter from Saxony, ‘It shall be my study to do what I can to render your life happy; and, if you die before me, I shall endeavour to do honour to your memory.’
He grew less oblique — as in May 1768, five years before the Hebrides tour.
Boswell finding Johnson ‘in the kindest and most agreeable frame of mind’ asked him ‘explicitly whether it would be improper to publish his letters after his death.
His answer was, ‘Nay, Sir, when I am dead, you may do as you will.’’
The celebrated modus operandi was more or less specified by Johnson himself.
There is an entry in the Life for Tuesday, 31 March 1772, recounting a conversation the pair had in Boswell's lodgings at Conduit Street in London, having lunched with General Paoli, an Italian military statesman, another of Boswell's scalps, to whom he had introduced Johnson.
Boswell does not say which of them raised the question of biography, and somewhat out of context he leads into a comment from Johnson: ‘Nobody can write the life of a man, but those who have eat and drunk and lived in social intercourse with him.’
I said, that if it was not troublesome and presuming too much, I would  request him to tell me all the little circumstances of his life; what schools he attended, when he came to Oxford, when he came to London, &c., &c., He did not disapprove of my curiosity as to these particulars; but said, ‘They'll come out by degrees as we talk together.’’
A year later, on Tuesday, 13 April 1773, Boswell ‘again solicited him to communicate to me the particulars of his early life.
He said, ‘You shall have them all for twopence.
I hope you will know a great deal more of me before you write my Life.’’
So, by the time they went to Scotland, Boswell had visibly engaged with the project, which accounts for the everyday discipline he displayed in writing his Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides.
At eleven o'clock that Friday night they arrived in Montrose.
The travellers regarded their inn, The Ship (long eroded), as no more than a functional staging-post, an ill-mannered house, too, run by William Driver — an Englishman, as Boswell pointed out to Johnson with some glee.
Johnson's account discusses the hostelry's unsavouriness by contrast with the generally strong composure of the town, which he found ‘well built, airy and clean’, but at the inn ‘did not find a reception such as we thought proportionate to the commercial opulence of the place’.
Some dirty-finger business again took place with the sugar in the lemonade, as had happened in Boyd's at Edinburgh.
The pair then sat and talked desultorily.
For ‘proposing to carry lemons with us to Sky [sic]that he might be sure to have his lemonade’, Johnson ticked off Boswell — on two counts: that he, Sam, did not wish to be viewed as someone who could not do without his preferences; and that it was ‘very bad manners to carry provisions to any man's house, as if he could not entertain you.
To an inferior it is oppressive; to a superior it is insolent.’
They discussed two histories of music recently advertised, and Boswell believed each would suffer from the other.
Johnson contradicted this, believing the comparisons would talk both books into greater prominence.
The intrusive Boswell then took another liberty —; that of pointing out to Johnson ‘that he very often sat quite silent for a long time, even when in company with only a single friend’, at which Johnson reminded Boswell of an acquaintance who had  once observed, ‘Sir, you are like a ghost: you never speak till you are spoken to.’
Boswell's biographical method pulls a double bind: he irritates while he rewards.
On the one hand, his invasiveness of Johnson triggers an immediate cringe: on the other, were not Boswell so crass so frequently, his readers could not get so close to Johnson.
Modern biographers suffer many accusations: that they trawl too widely and deeply; that they pick over entrails insensitively, confirming Dr Arbuthnot's definition of biography as ‘the new terror of death’; that they invade their subject's most intimate quarters and lay all bare, regardless, it is said, of relevance or the feelings of surviving kin.
Boswell conducted his invasiveness while Johnson was still alive, and even though the result seems not overtly lurid, I doubt whether many areas of Johnson remained uncombed.
In general, Boswell's Life of Johnson provides an immortal Pepysian and aromatic sweep of eighteenth-century literary society, recounted in Boswell's lovely candour and flawedness.
The essential triumph comes from the assembly of details, and the most valuable of these is revealed where contradictoriness is introduced, at which point the picture of Johnson always grows clearer.
Thus, at Montrose, Boswell took a sharp likeness, in which we see the other side of the opinionated, often pompous, astonishingly patronising Johnson, the man with a statement on everything, the clumping, farting, knob-faced denouncer; Johnson was also a thoughtful man of good manners and pensiveness, a quiet, reflective, astute man who had been knocked around.
When he arrived in London from Lichfield, Johnson had to use his strapping muscles and burliness: he became a porter in Covent Garden in order to subsist.
Now, the elderly man who endured a waiter's dirty fingers in his lemonade at Montrose could hardly have been more famous or respected, and there he sits in a dirty inn, happy to enjoy a little quiet, and quite at ease to do so, even in the company of one of the most garrulous men in the realm whose nature abhorred a conversational vacuum; Johnson even expressed a simple delight in being thought as silent as a ghost.
A further gloss on this quieter side of his character appears during Johnson's own reflection in (rather than upon) Montrose — where he comments that he has by now had an opportunity to  compare Scotland's beggars with others he has seen.
He makes two points: one, that they are as numerous proportionately in Edinburgh as in London, but in Scottish towns more plentiful than in comparable English locations; and two, on the whole he finds them more quiet, and modest.
He wonders if this be a drawback, perhaps, to their ultimate aim?
‘Though their behaviour may strike with more force the heart of a stranger, they are certainly in danger of missing the attention of their countrymen.’
Next morning, the pair took the air of Montrose; they saw the church, since replaced with another; the town hall had ‘a handsome fabrick with a portico’, wrote Johnson (it still has), while Boswell noted that it had a ‘good dancing-room, and other rooms for tea-drinking’.
Today, it houses municipal authorities, and at ten o'clock last night a bell rang continuously from that direction —‘The curfew,’ said the hotel porter this summer morning in 1991.
A neat museum houses military uniforms of the Johnsonian period alongside a park as tailored as Scottish prudence.
Johnson went into an apothecary's with a prescription he filled out for himself; on account of the Latin, and perhaps on account of his title, the chemist's counter-hand took Dr Johnson for a medical man.
For all his invasive tendencies, Boswell does not tell us why Johnson needed medicine.
The journey from Montrose to Laurencekirk, ten and a half miles, takes three hours and a quarter on foot, on the undulating and awkward A937.
Hugh MacDiarmid, who lived at Montrose, and edited the local newspaper while enjoying a fruitful period of his literary life, described Montrose as ‘a very attractive small burgh with a wide agricultural hinterland’, and these fields now began to materialise.
Distant, forested hills to the left and smaller hills on the right contributed their surges to the surface of the countryside, and these undulations across the land ran under the roadway like energy cables, sapping the strength from the legs.
Johnson found the terrain ‘still naked’ but bountiful, with land so utterly ploughed that he wondered where the grass grew to feed the plough-horses.
Before they headed onwards, Boswell wrote a note at their unappetising inn.
Monboddo was one of eighteenth-century Britain's quirks.
A judge and landlord, he throve on amateur metaphysics and early anthropology, purveying monkey theories almost a century ahead of Darwin.
A tinch less rigorous, though: Monboddo believed that monkeys became men when the practice of sitting down eventually eroded their tails.
An etymologist too: in a study called Origin and Progress of Language, which appeared in six volumes between 1773 and 1792, Monboddo dismissed Johnson's most singular achievement in the same field, saying Johnson ‘had compiled a dictionary of a barbarous language, a work which a man of real genius, rather than undertake, would choose to die of hunger’.
Johnson held a not dissimilar reciprocal opinion, comparing Monboddo to another of his own bugbears, Rousseau.
Four years earlier he told Boswell that the difference between the two was that whereas Rousseau talked nonsense and knew he did — because he talked it so well — Monboddo, who talked an inferior brand, did not know he was talking nonsense.
In other words, for a man to talk lowgrade nonsense, at any time, much less constantly, and never know he was doing it…?
What, thus, may we infer exactly from Johnson's remark that he would go two miles out of his way to meet Monboddo?
Only two?
Laurencekirk has another of those long, long streets; home for four years and by then long gone, of Thomas Ruddiman the grammarian, mentioned by Boswell and admired by Johnson.
They called on the minister in Laurencekirk, who at first refused to  respond to the announcement of their arrival, until Boswell sent in his name.
Then the minister deigned to appear and defended himself by saying he had once come out to a stranger who called, but the man proved to be ‘a little worth person’.
Lord Monboddo's eccentric grandeur has disappeared.
A speculative developer rearranged the ancient house, and in the grounds built several modern houses, so that the original configuration of the mansion's direct surroundings has almost been obscured.
Over the cream pebble-dash and olive grey windows of the great house, some turrets may yet be seen beneath what I take to be the original small roof-slates; and a plaque high on the wall —; ‘1635 RE’ with what looks like ‘ID’; and a couple of lions guarding the door.
No reply from the down-a-step hall door: the new owners have raised a fine hedge of thick honeysuckle; an enormous monkeypuzzle dominates the immediate skyline.
‘Monboddo,’ says Boswell, ‘is a wretched place, wild and naked, with a poor old house; though if I recollect right,[he did]there are two turrets which mark an old baron's residence.’
En route across this bare land, Johnson recited Macbeth's speech on meeting the witches.
‘Say from whence you owe this strange intelligence? or why upon this blasted heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting?’
His Lordship Monboddo, wearing a little round hat and a farmer's suit, met them at the gate.
The area surrounding Monboddo must have contained an aerodrome at some stage, perhaps during wartime, as evidenced in a few remaining Nissen huts, now filled with old packing cases and pallets, and undistinguished, domestic timber artefacts of all sorts.
Although the landscape did not disappoint me nearly as severely as it did Johnson — subsequent farmers have grown many trees, and in the distance a great house still touches the sky — Monboddo may no longer be considered a classical Scottish fortified house.
Nigel Tranter, in volume four (published 1966) of his series The Fortified House in Scotland, claims that Monboddo merits attention, even if‘decayed’ and ‘in a bad state structurally’.
Since Tranter's description, the renovator has removed any possibility of seeing, for instance, a gaunt and wild building like the House of Shaws in Kidnapped, where David Balfour almost met his death at the hands of his scheming uncle.
Tranter found something like six  hundred of these fortified houses across Scotland, and attributes their presence to a combination of national character and links with France.
When tall, angled, high-gabled and firm, they have perfected the art of looming, and some of their gateways are arched with stone, and some of their tower windows might still have a Mary, Queen of Scots, or a tartan Lady of Shalott roaming soulfully behind their small winking panes, or a Rapunzel leaning out into the sunshine.
They symbolise ‘Adventure-Scotland’, with that certain Gothic-ness of Stevenson again, and Scott even more.
What imagination anywhere could not respond to the image of strangers galloping hard on a moonswept night towards such high turrets?
Not so in Monboddo today.
When Greek met Greek here, they talked of a Greek, Homer —; and of other things, farming, and Virgil, and cider-making, and emigration, and manners, and biography, and learning.
The conversation flowed with the current of many Johnsonian exchanges — a topic raised, a little amplification and a final exegesis, leading to a brief conclusion, in which Johnson habitually dangled one of his bright flashes of learning, catching the sun.
His capacity for controversy in such social encounters had gained Johnson a great deal of his divinity in English letters, but in Scotland, with the good manners of a visitor necessarily prevailing, such intercourse invariably proved pleasant, Lord Monboddo's house typically thus.
Neither man liked the other, but they had strewn eggs in their own pathways towards each other and they walked on them all afternoon.
Except at the beginning, when the eccentric lord immediately clashed with Johnson, even though Johnson says that the magnetism of Lord Monboddo's conversation ‘easily drew us out of our way, and the entertainment which we received would have been a sufficient recompense for a much greater deviation’.
Monboddo opened the game with his belief that our ancestors were greater than ourselves.
Johnson disagreed: ‘No, no my lord.
We are as strong as they and a great deal wiser,’ which, as Boswell points out, ‘was an assault upon one of Lord Monboddo's capital dogmas, and I was afraid there would have been a violent altercation in the very close, before we got into the house’.
Fortunately Monboddo's ‘ancient politesse’ stirred itself, and thereby was social  catastrophe averted.
Johnson thereafter responded to his host's familial hospitality with courtesy and agreeableness.
This is how the afternoon proceeded.
Monboddo led them in, saying that since he was dressed like a farmer, they should have with him a farmer's family dinner.
Remarking that he would not have forgiven Boswell had he not brought Johnson to Monboddo, he showed the travellers a stalk of corn, his laetas segetes, his abundant crop, and remarked that Virgil, to judge from his writings, seemed an equally practical and enthusiastic farmer.
Whereupon Johnson observed that it did not necessarily follow ‘that a man who has written a good poem on an art, has practised it’, citing excellently instructive verses on cider by a man never known to have made any.
Boswell raised the topic of emigration: Johnson distinguished between its value to ‘a man of mere animal life’ and ‘a man of any intellectual enjoyment’: the former content to wait for the earth to produce, the latter unlikely to wish barbarism upon himself and his descendants.
In the next exchange — or, rather, Boswell's footnote to it —; comes another part of the answer to that literary-sleuth question of Boswell's Physical modus operandi.
Today he would have had a tape recorder: did he, like Dickens, at least have shorthand, a not unknown writerly aid since Cicero's time?
In London he sat beside Johnson in their various venues; now he rode beside him in the post-chaise taking them up through eastern Scotland; next he would canter along beside him to the Western Isles.
Did he pause to note the whole lot, or did he have extraordinary recall, writing in his room late at night or next morning, or did he get the bones down on paper, and afterwards flesh out the rest with Johnson's consultations?
Given the unevenness and venereal adventure in Boswell's private life, any recollection in tranquillity would, in general, seem likely to be patchy.
Nowhere so far in my limited knowledge of the pair has evidence of shorthand materialised —; although at law he may have had some awareness of the skill.
But surely too many conversations are recorded in the Life for Boswell to have checked them all in literal detail?
Roadside reading at Monboddo in pleasant  sunshine begins to provide answers to these questions.
‘He and my lord spoke highly of Homer.
Johnson: ‘He had all  the learning of his age.
The shield of Achilles shews a nation in war, a nation in peace: harvest sport, nay stealing.’’
At this point Boswell inserts an asterisk, and his footnote begins, ‘My note of this is much too short.
Brevis esse laboro, obscurusfio.’
(‘I labour to be brief, I make myself unclear.’)
Declaring that he wishes to offer to the public ‘the very Journal which Dr Johnson read’, he says he will not ‘expand the text in any considerable degree, though I may occasionally supply a word to complete the sense as I fill up the blanks of abbreviation in the writing’.
So that is how he did it: as I fill up the blanks of abbreviation in the writing — with ‘wd’, and ‘wl’, and ‘sd’, and ‘J’, and ‘Ld M’, and ‘ystdy’, and ‘Abrdn’, and ‘Mntrse’, and ‘Ednbro’, or some such?
It casts a new light (well — a farthing candle) on Boswell's recordings of Johnson's aphorisms: ‘Whn a mn is tired of Lndn he is trd of lfe.’
And what about that remark —‘the very Journal which Dr Johnson read’?
Surely he meant that Johnson read it all the time, as Boswell wrote it?
Or, since Johnson was dead when the Journal was published, did he mean that Johnson read the later stages of the manuscript as Boswell worked his way through it?
Other questions — did he have a quill pen, and therefore a supply of ink?
Did he have lead and a slate?
Later we learn that he used a pencil: Faber in Germany were already making graphite rods.
All this leads to another question (thesis students, please note)—; the relationship, if any, between the physical form and intellectual product of a writer's trade.
The American novelist Thomas Wolfe wrote standing at a tall refrigerator — a chair and table being too cramped for the big mountain man — and he dropped unnumbered sheets, each with a few scrawled words, into a cardboard box at his feet.
Churchill also stood, at a tall writing desk.
Edgar Wallace dictated at speed.
James Joyce wore a dentist's white jacket in the hope that the reflected light would make the words brighter to his poor hurting eyes.
John Betjeman scribbled verses on the backs of envelopes and read them aloud in his car.
Nigel Tranter writes his novels on small cards while out walking.
Roald Dahl sat in a garden shed with an array of pencils and erasers on a board across his knees.
Vladimir Nabokov squeezed tiny writing on small record or filing cards.
Alan Ayckbourn leaves his new play until  the last terrible moments when the cast has been assembled and the theatre booked and the tickets sold.
No matter how Boswell did it physically — and later it will transpire that he wrote some of it in a notebook Johnson gave him; no matter how he proceeded editorially, whether through a combination of this abbreviated writing, then checking afterwards what was said, and finally choosing — or agreeing — how much of Johnson's commentary and observation he should release, Boswell achieved something at least as important as a legally accurate record — he created, above everything, the feel of a full account.
The conversation at Monboddo that afternoon exemplifies it; they considered how Homer never describes his characters, but permits them to develop themselves.
Such were the exchanges that Boswell, with his (by our standards) imperfect means of record, noted down — and even had time to comment that the two men had begun to ‘agree like brothers,.
They next moaned about the decrease of learning in England, with Monboddo complaining of, in Scotland, not learning's mere decrease, but its extinction.
Johnson attributed such decline in England to the fact that the bishops were now using other, more political rather than intellectual, methods of gaining preferment.
Johnson then ‘examined young Arthur, Lord Monboddo's son, in Latin.
He answered very well.’
Monboddo and Johnson debated ‘whether the Savage or the London Shopkeeper had the best existence,: unamazingly, no firm conclusion was reached, apart from Boswell's recurring delight at how well the encounter went between the two men.
Johnson went to the lavatory — at least, that is presumably what Boswell means when he says, ‘having retired for a short time’—; and Boswell and Monboddo engaged cordially with each other .
Johnson returned, and as the ladies left the table, Johnson, a man who ‘insisted that politeness was of great consequence in society’, stood.
‘Depend upon it,’ he said, ‘the want of it [politeness]never fails to produce something disagreeable.’
Boswell concludes the account of their visit by satisfying a little further his search for concord between Johnson and Monboddo — each had a black servant.
Johnson, having established that Monboddo's servant, Gory, had been baptised — and even confirmed by the Bishop of Durham — gave the man a shilling.
At this point Boswell records having experienced a qualm regarding Johnson's continuance of the journey, because the previous night Johnson had said, ‘If we must ride much, we shall not go, and there's an end on't.’
Seeing him in good spirits now, Boswell teased him for his earlier  hesitancy , called him ‘a delicate Londoner…a macaroni’, and Johnson defended himself with an unserious disingenuousness by saying he had only feared not finding a horse able enough to carry him.
Boswell employs over a thousand words to describe the Monboddo visit, which began around mid-day, and ended when they had to leave for Aberdeen which they did not reach until late that night.
Johnson flits over it all in a sentence, and in his letters to Mrs Thrale he came forth only a little more, alluding only to the success of the visit, and to the debate as to whether the savage or the shopkeeper had the best life.
‘Our opinions were, I think, maintained on both sides without full conviction; Monboddo declared boldly for the savage, and I perhaps for that reason sided with the Citizen.’
This accords with a remark Johnson made to Boswell as they drove towards Aberdeen: ‘I might have taken the side of the savage equally, had anybody else taken the side of the shopkeeper.’
Not a savage nor a shopkeeper to be seen on this windy, sunny afternoon, great clouds pillowing across the sky.
Across the scrubby ground past the Nissen huts runs a main road, with a bus service to Stonehaven on the A94, where it would again pick up  the A92.
Warm scents rose from a honeysuckle hedge at Monboddo, the much-changed home of a man who, according to Sir Walter Scott, went out at night with a candle to inspect his turnips growing in the fields; who, hating to sit behind a horse's backside, would not travel in a carriage and therefore — he was in his eighties — rode to London on horseback; who took a cold bath every day and damaged his children's health by insisting they did the same; and who, when in residence at Edinburgh, gave dinner parties at which his wine-flagons were wreathed in garlands of roses.
‘We came somewhat late to Aberdeen,’ wrote Johnson, ‘and found the inn so full, that we had some difficulty in obtaining admission, till Mr Boswell made himself known.
His name overpowered all objection, and we found a very good house and civil treatment.’
Mr Thrale had written to Johnson care of Boswell at Aberdeen; probably a refreshing fact to Sam who in his final illness observed to his servant, ‘An odd thought strikes me — we shall receive no letters in the grave.’
Handing over the envelope from Mr Thrale, the waiter at the New Inn recognised Boswell's name and likeness to his father: Lord Auchinleck stayed there on circuit.
Thus, Boswell and Johnson found a room at the crowded New Inn, which no longer exists: the corner where it stood, and which it once shared with the city jail, is now occupied comprehensively by a bank.
They stayed in Aberdeen from the night of Saturday, 21 August, to the morning of Tuesday the 24th, venturing forth from the New Inn to see and be seen, to be entertained and, in Johnson's case, to be honoured by the body municipal.
‘As Scotland is little known to the greater part of those who may read these observations, it is not superfluous to relate that under the name Aberdeen are comprised two towns standing about a mile distant from each other, but governed, I think, by the same magistrates.’
Johnson was human too: in writing to Mrs Thrale he contradicted this point and stated more correctly that both towns had separate civil and academic identities.
There are still two towns — in effect, however, the new Aberdeen has all but completely superseded Old Aberdeen, which now exists only in the way many international cities have a Latin Quarter or a Chinatown, only somewhat smaller and — as becomes all  Aberdonians and most east-coast Scots — very discreet.
Johnson's report otherwise remains applicable, with Old Aberdeen the ‘ancient episcopal city’, possessing ‘the appearance of a town in decay’, and New Aberdeen the location of bustling commerce: ‘the houses are large and lofty, and the streets spacious and clean.
They build almost wholly with the granite used in the new pavement of the streets of London…
It is beautiful and must be very lasting.’
Insofar as their Scottish adventure was concerned, Boswell the diarist and biographer, and Johnson the man of letters and lexicographer, had become travel writers.
Aberdeen, whatever its staging-post status in their plans, received the same attention as their eventual western destinations, and Johnson approached it with the attitude he later brought to the Highlands and the west, with Boswell, for his part, consistent in the manner and style of his own reportage — observing Johnson as he observed Scotland.
These arrangements would not have differed had they been in the Fens, or watching Scandinavia's hot springs: Johnson went to inspect the landscape he described: Boswell took his landscape, the lumpy Dr Johnson, with him.
Johnson thereby validated the journey in his reports, and, true enquirer that he was, did not accordingly neglect to report on such a major place as Aberdeen.
Even if it were not a leading objective of his tour, his natural intelligent curiosity, and his conscientiousness on behalf of his readers overcame any notional hierarchy of information.
Scotland he had gone to see, and Scotland they would receive from his eyes and words.
Thus, the Aberdeen report in his book, however he anticipated his Hebridean travels, is the largest so far, with St Andrews a close second: his longest passages are naturally reserved for Skye and the islands.
In so measuring him, another consideration must be taken into account.
Johnson was a proportionate man: his language and thought had balance in them, as had his own spirit.
It is possible to argue that he wrote in the proportion to which each location claimed or received his spans of time and attention — and as he spent more than twice the length of time out on the islands as he did getting there, the greater part of his book addresses the west.
For Sunday, 22 August, Boswell once more makes available their timetable and (almost unrelievedly academic) personnel record.
Professor Thomas Gordon joined them for breakfast at the New Inn, after which they went to a Service at the ‘English chapel’, that is to say, the Episcopalian, that is to say , the Anglican church in Scotland.
The congregation was ‘respectable’, the organist, a Mr Tait, ‘admirable’.
After service they strolled down to the waterside, where they talked about stockings and the weaving of plaid; ‘What particular parts of commerce are chiefly exercised by the merchants of Aberdeen, I have not inquired,’ wrote Johnson.
‘The manufacture which forces itself upon a stranger's eye is that of knit-stockings, on which the women of the lower class are visibly employed.’
Turn to Boswell for the gloss — that it was ‘Cromwell's soldiers taught the Aberdeen people to make shoes and stockings, and to plant cabbages.’
At which information Johnson laughed.
One of Boswell's invaluable moments occurs here.
From time to time in the Life, he describes Johnson's voice as manly, or deep, or sonorous, or loud.
Others have chosen to describe not so much the sound, as the use — to harangue, to interrupt, to hold the floor, to declaim.
Johnson, as he did at Montrose, also employed much silence, and many who had come to one social occasion or another expecting to hear the grand disquisitioner, found him disappointingly reticent and withdrawn, even if making little antic noises to himself.
Perhaps in those preceding silences he took himself through some sort of editing process, preparatory to making an entrance in which not a word would be wasted.
When he chose to speak, he used his voice to argue fiercely and with great precision, and now, on a Sunday morning ramble in Aberdeen, Boswell suddenly became aware, ‘to an extraordinary degree, of Dr Johnson's excellent English pronunciation.
I cannot account for its striking me more now than any other day, but it was as if new to me; and I listened to every sentence he spoke as if to a musical composition.’
Given that Boswell does not record any singularly new form of felicity in Johnson's speech, perhaps he was struck with the contrast between Johnson's mode of speech and the Doric accents of Aberdeen.
Strolling, they pondered public education versus private  schooling; Johnson wondered why boys from England had been sent as far as Aberdeen to be educated, with ‘so many good schools in England’, and they went back to the New Inn, to be joined there by Sir Alexander Gordon, an old friend of Johnson's, who had sent a card in advance, and through Boswell we join their conversation as it drifts back to the stocking-making.
Sir Alexander, Professor of Medicine at the King's College, revealed that in peacetime Aberdeen exported a hundred thousand pounds' worth of stockings a year, and in wartime a hundred and seventy thousand.
When Johnson enquired the cause of the difference, Sir Alexander claimed that there was ‘more occasion for them in war’, but Professor Thomas Gordon (no relation, Boswell?) said, ‘Because the Germans, who are our great rivals in the manufacture of stockings, are otherwise employed in time of war.’
Johnson ate ‘several plate-fulls of Scotch broth, with barley and peas in it, and seemed very fond of the dish’.
When Boswell, hearing his praise of it, said, perhaps enquiringly, ‘You never ate it before,’ Johnson replied that he had hot but did not care how soon he ate it again.
(In a long letter to Hester Thrale on 30 September, written from Ostig on Skye, he remarked with a different emphasis: ‘Barley broath [sic]is a constant dish, and is made well in every house.
A stranger, if he is prudent, will secure his share for it is not certain that he will be able to eat any thing else.’)
In the afternoon they all had tea with the ‘lively, cheerful, sensible’ wife of an Episcopalian minister — Mrs Riddoch, Boswell's cousin, the former Miss Dallas: her husband was unwell and stayed in his sick room.
Johnson met Mrs Riddoch's little niece, Stuart Dallas, and, with his voice deliberately booming and hollow, told her he was a giant, that he slept in a cave, ‘and had a bed in the rock, and she should have a bed cut opposite it’.
Throughout their journey several topics remained alive between them, to be returned to again and again, not so much as if the first discourse had not resolved matters — more as it they remained as life issues, or questions of the day.
These included — in broad, and in aspects — politics, religion, and, one of Johnson's favourite subjects, the law.
On the night he came to Edinburgh, sitting up with Boswell in James's Court until two o'clock in the morning, they talked of a recent case in which a murder, committed twenty years before, became a legal talking-point when the judges of Scotland allowed, as a plea, the length of time elapsed.
Johnson returned to this case now in Aberdeen, saying that even though he understood how difficult it would be to ensure accurate evidence, it still did not make it right that a murderer should go unpunished.
Then, as he frequently did, he took a moral line, based on what he saw as natural law, and said he would not blame, and might even assist, the victim's relatives in such a case, should they wish to exact retribution and then hide.
Then, Boswell and Johnson returned to the New Inn and sat quietly all evening, and (it being Sunday presumably) discussed Christ and Christianity.
‘Never,’ writes Boswell, ‘did I see him in a better frame; calm, gentle, wise, holy’— with Johnson opining that the essence of the Crucifixion lay in showing to the world that even the Son of God suffered on account of sin, and in doing so, displayed how heinous a thing sin must be.
On the evidence of the many religious interpolations reported by Boswell, Johnson could have been a divine, a mystic.
His faith comprised curiously disparate elements — the rough, frightened, humility of the countryman; the thoughtful worshipper; the vigorous enquirer; and even though not a micro-molecule of disrespect ever enters his attitude towards his Deity, his natural radical-ness stood so near at hand one can almost feel its heat.
It never broke out above the surface: he feared heresy and blasphemy too much.
On Monday, more academics swam in Johnson's travelling aquarium: Principal Campbell, Professor Ross and a Dr Gerard, who had ‘come six miles from the country on purpose’.
First of all, they viewed the Marischal College, and at one o'clock went to the Town House, or Town Hall, where the magistrates waited to honour their distinguished visitor.
The place of this ceremony has also disappeared, but a contemporary record describes a fine, high-ceilinged, large-windowed room, hung with candle sconces and more than one crystal  candelabrum.
Johnson took enormous pleasure in the honour, and reported it in both his book and, more touchingly, in his correspondence with Mrs Thrale: ‘I had the honour of attending the Lord Provost of Aberdeen, and was presented with the freedom of the city, not in a gold box but in good Latin.
Let me pay Scotland just one praise.
There was no officer gaping for a fee; this could have been said of no city on the English side of the Tweed.’
He mentions this ‘fee’ in his book, too; he may not have relished the idea of paid officials cadging tips.
Part of the honour in Aberdeen included the conferee's right to wear his citation, or burgess-ticket, all day in his hat.
When the parchment had been read aloud — Samuel Johnson, L.L.D.
receptus et admissus fuit in municipes et fratres guildae prefat burgi de Aberedeen — it was then sealed, rolled like a diploma and fastened to Johnson's hat with a red ribbon.
‘I wore my patent of freedom,’ he told Mrs Thrale, ‘in my hat from the New town to the Old, about a mile.’
Boswell amplifies in a way which casts a slightly different glow on the affair: he comments on how striking it was to hear all the aldermen of Aberdeen drinking Johnson's-health with much exclamation of the great man's name.
Neither Boswell nor Johnson would have been so damningly ungracious as to suggest (as other Scottish cities accused), that in the interests of free drink Aberdeen's city fathers were promiscuous with their honours.
After the walk to Old Aberdeen, Boswell and Johnson ate lunch.
The following seven people sat around the table — both Gordons, that is, Professor Thomas and the host Sir Alexander; Provost Jopp, he of the conferring; Professor Ross and Professor Dunbar; Boswell and Johnson.
After they had eaten, Dr Gerard arrived, as did Professor Leslie and Professor MacLeod.
It all seems to have lacked sparkle; Johnson told Mrs Thrale, ‘Boswell was very angry that the Aberdeen professors would not talk,’ while Boswell says they were afraid to, and as a consequence he and Johnson round themselves ‘barren’— having already spent a morning in which they had scant conversation with anyone.
For whatever reason, they all now sat in some dumbness at Sir Alexander Gordon's table, and it is the only meal so far recorded by Boswell  in which he has no conversation to report, nor argument, nor words of Johnson.
Dr Gerard, from six miles out, he who had come in specially, did try to sling something in.
He told Johnson that Warburton (the combative English divine and man of letters, whose generally controversial national presence made him a common topic of Johnsonian conversation) had a close relationship with an unnamed ‘eminent printer’.
Johnson, never under an obligation to generate social ease, dismissed that by saying ‘The intimacy is such as one of the professors here may have with one of the carpenters who is repairing the college,’ Johnson's point being that the printer, having printed some of Warburton's works, might perhaps have bought the copyright in one or two of them.
Dr Gerard fought back, by saying that he had seen a letter from Warburton to the printer, complaining that one half of Scotland's clergy were fanatics, and the other half were infidels, but Johnson still gainsaid him; Warburton, he believed, wrote as he spoke — without thinking; ‘Sir, the very worst way of being intimate, is by scribbling.’
Other than this exchange, and a desultory extension of it, in which Boswell tried to get his Bear to perform by raising the quality of genius as a conversational topic, lunch and its aftermath proceeded to a dull conclusion.
Unlike Edinburgh, Aberdeen did not groom the fur of Ursa Major.
After lunch they walked in Sir Alexander's garden ‘and saw his little grotto, which is hung with pieces of poetry written in a fair hand’.
Johnson complained of having been rendered exhausted by Sir Alexander's over-zealous efforts to entertain him.
They visited two booksellers' shops, looking for a volume of poems by the Aberdonian Latin poet, Arthur Johnson, who had been Principal of the Marischal College.
They called on the unwell clergyman Mr Riddoch, and again finding the conversation wanting — the poor man was unable to tell Johnson how much a university education cost at Aberdeen — the couple resisted all invitations to supper.
Back at their inn, they sat quietly reflecting how little Aberdeen had offered them in terms of conversational or intellectual stimulation — or, as Boswell reported Johnson's remark, ‘that the Aberdonians had not started a single mawkin [the Scottish word for hare]for us to pursue’.
Fingers across the map to retrace their journey — from the New Inn they went to the English chapel, walked to the shore, saw the Marischal College, were welcomed at the Town House, viewed Old Aberdeen, looked at the Old College, visited the King's College where Sir Alexander Gordon was professor of Medicine, and visited two bookshops.
Not a challenging or penetrating tour of enquiry, especially as the population of Aberdeen at the time must have been not less than twenty thousand.
In Johnson's report, the education offered by the city takes precedence over any popular descriptions or concerns, beginning with an interest in the fact that Hector Boece or Boethius became the first President of the King's College, in 1494, at the instigation of Bishop William Elphinstone, effectively the founder of Aberdeen University — whose tomb may still be seen.
Johnson admired Boece, not for his historical accuracy, but for his prose and intellectual style, ‘formed with great diligence upon ancient models, and wholly uninfected with monastic barbarity’.
He excuses Boece's historical inventions — on account of which his Latin History of Scotland and others have been long dismissed, and now have only curiosity value — by saying that Boece wrote in an age when all men, owing to lack of true knowledge, were credulous, and, dazzled with the light of discovery after such long dark ages, could not see distinctly.
Johnson also enjoyed catching sight of ancient texts in Aberdeen — a Hebrew manuscript ‘of exquisite penmanship’, and ‘a Latin translation of Aristotle's Politicks by Leonardus Aretinus, written in the Roman character with nicety and beauty, which, as the art of printing has made them no longer necessary, are not now to be found’.
He also interested himself in the administration of this seat of learning, the colours of the students' gowns — scarlet; and the professors' — black.
The eating and sleeping arrangements of the students, whether in college or abroad about the town, caught his attention; the length of the courses; the kind of degree available, and all the curricular paraphernalia of learning.
He had addressed such matters in Edinburgh, St Andrews, and would in Glasgow, with an awareness that he was reporting Scotland for an English audience as he might have reported Bavaria or Sweden.
Johnson  therefore knew in advance the principal social and economic demography of his readership — the professional and/or wealthy classes in and around London.
Aberdeen has a feeling of true foreign-ness, a different flavour —; Scottish, undoubtedly, and therefore brisk and organised, but not without a feel of Norse and beyond.
The quayside had as many ferries lined up as a Greek port, big-snouted vessels bound for Orkney or the Shetland islands, and perhaps distant Ophir.
It feels more like Trieste, though, than Piraeus: the sounds of the voices in the streets murmured similarly of exotica.
In Trieste a number of nations converge — Albanian and Yugoslavian, as well as Italian and Venetian; here the Scandinavians and the Calvinists and the hard Canadian men of the oil lift the city's atmosphere out of a local milieu.
All things sparkle in bright light: a dowdy creature will gleam in a ballroom.
The stone they used to build Aberdeen may be built for endurance rather than seduction, but when it catches the sun it offers a lively spirit as well as a safe haven.
Much of the Aberdeen they saw is now no more.
The strongest and oldest main parts of the current Granite City suggest Victorian wealth, not-very-old money — long Union Street, and Albyn Place and Albyn Terrace, Queens Gardens, Prince Arthur Street: behind these façades live a class who, a century and more ago, would have populated the novels of an Aberdonian Trollope or Thackeray.
The firmness of the houses has not changed; a few may have become offices, or been sub-divided into what must surely be splendid apartments, but the depth of the society persists.
Stout merchant and professional cash built these statements of position and status all over these islands.
If one may suspend conscience, and forget the conditions and costs of labour which allowed them to create this wealth, then these streets — as they do in London and Edinburgh, and still to be seen in Dublin — define the comfort of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century middle classes.
With haughtily reassuring windows, tall, regular, gleaming, discreet, and vivid brass bellpulls, and deep steps of extraordinary cleanliness, a poor man might walk here as a Dickensian child put its face to a windowpane.
Turn left at the end of Union Street for the Marischal College, a tall and wide building of white-grey stone, with many windows and pinned down by several bus-stops.
Other than at Oxford and Cambridge, educational buildings seem generally to have become disappointing.
Their great preserved facades give way to the necessities of low-budget modern living — poor furniture, inhibited taste, as at St Andrews, and a disappointing lack of the glories of old lecture theatres.
The Marischal College has an attractive staircase, and that curious atmosphere of university colleges — a busy air, yet with few people in evidence.
A person, perhaps a porter, said there was not a lot to see at the Marischal College.
Any College treasures, any old manuscripts for example?
He said, no, nothing like that, all gone, that occasionally the place held exhibitions of Mankind and so-forth and they were quite interesting.
Any portraits of interest?
No, no.
Any beautiful rooms?
That would be a matter of opinion; he had a newspaper which he kept looking at, and shaking out.
How many students attended the Marischal College?
Quite a lot, but they come and they go.
Anybody to whom one could talk about the place?
Depends on what you want to find out.
Any record of Dr Johnson's visit?
He doubted that.
Well, maybe somebody would know.
But he's away.
‘We often get tourists here,’ he said.
Well — Boswell and Johnson found Aberdeen a place where conversation had not proved stimulating.
Then, like a host who becomes most animated when his guests are leaving, this leader of the campaign against garrulousness gave me succinct directions to Old Aberdeen.
Johnson's ‘about a mile’ takes twenty minutes on foot, quite a downhill journey, and, if Old Aberdeen be small, it is also pleasing.
Colleges on one side, sweet-cheeked houses on the other, and ahead an old municipal building; the architecture of the larger properties, though varied, is still Sir Walter Scott-gothic.
The stretch called College Bounds becomes High Street, crosses the busy St Machar's Drive and forks: to the right, Don Street, to the left, the discreet Chanonry.
Both rows converge upon St Machar's Cathedral, and then wander their separate ways through Seaton Park to the River Don, and eventually the Brig o' Balgownie —; although Johnson does not seem to have walked that far.
He did visit the King's College and Boswell name-dropped regarding the chapel, wherein lies the fifteenth-century Bishop Elphinstone, ‘of whom I shall have occasion to write,’ declared Bozzy, ‘in my history of James IV of Scotland, the patron of my family’: Auchinleck was granted to the Boswells in return for favours rendered.
The delightful chapel had no other callers; the afternoon light turned the stained-glass windows to kaleidoscopes, and outside, the westering sun gilded the tiles and eyebrows of the roofs and high old buildings.
A wedding had begun at St Machar's — gowned shenanigans and excitements, the cars, and the relatives, and the best feet forward.
Brides do not tremble, they fuss; bridesmaids even more so, and men stand about sheepishly, collies waiting for a whistle telling them what to do.
How was Johnson at Aberdeen?
Bored, and humane, and gentle with the little Dallas girl, to whom he said he was a giant.
His capacity for addressing children impressed all who saw it.
When the Thrale children played games he participated — racing them barefoot, or pleased to be cast as the elephant in their zoo of animals.
He retained many child qualities of his own, including a liking for an excellent roll downhill, witnessed by one of his friends, a Mr Langton, who had walked with Johnson to the top of a very steep height.
‘When we understood what he meant to do, we endeavoured to dissuade him; but he was resolute, saying he had not had a roll for a long time; and taking out of his pockets whatever might be in them — keys, pencil, purse, or pen-knife — and laying himself parallel with the edge of the hill, he actually descended turning himself over and over till he came to the bottom.’
At night, the streets of the Granite City proved astonishingly full.
Crowds of people roistered along, chattering and sometimes cheering, of all ages and types.
A waitress in the hotel said they all remembered the day of the big Piper Alpha rig disaster ‘in the same way that we remembered where we were when Kennedy was shot’.
The police, patrolling numerously, said this midnight populousness was not uncommon in Aberdeen, but was perhaps unique in Scottish cities.
No such nightlife or streetlights here in August 1773; moments in Boswell's Life fix a fleeting glimpse: ‘When he walked, it was like the struggling gait of one in fetters’— even in Aberdeen?
Even with a diploma pinned to his hat, its red ribbon-seal fluttering in the breeze?
This large man, ‘whose countenance was the cast of an ancient statue’, says the concluding passage of the Life, tolerated unstimulatedly the hospitality of the silent professors, and wandered through Old Aberdeen looking for a book of poetry, then back to his inn.
The ear being the truest witness, Boswell's remark about Johnson's voice is very arresting.
It introduces the thought that in his speech as well as in his writing, Johnson understood that the essence of art lies in the perfect marriage of form and content, therefore, Boswell may have reached for an accuracy beyond sycophancy.
If Johnson did speak as he wrote — economically, pithily and with a gift of great accuracy — Boswell's Aberdeen observation means that he also sounded beautifully.
But again the questions — was Boswell telling the truth about Johnson, or was he presenting him in the best possible light?
Did this biographical relationship grow out of Johnson himself?
Who was manipulating whom?
Boswell had by now made it plain over a number of years that he wished to write Johnson's Life.
Ought we to think less of Johnson for agreeing because he knew full well that he could influence Boswell?
Another question: did Boswell write so glowingly of Johnson in Scotland in order to obtain Johnson's biographical blessing?
When Johnson, as we know he did, dipped into Boswell's Hebrides Journal, its tone cannot have put him off the notion of Boswell writing a Life.
In a footnote to an observation made in Mull, Boswell writes, ‘It is no small satisfaction to me to reflect, that Dr Johnson read this, and, after being apprised of my intention, communicated to me, at subsequent periods, many particulars of his life, which probably could not otherwise have been preserved.’
Johnson, however, fully aware of the likely number of biographers he might attract before and after his death, found here a biography in which he could have a say, thus not only securing his immortality, but controlling it.
They left Aberdeen at eight o'clock on the morning of Tuesday, 24 August, and, climbing to high ground above the city, headed north-east along the coast through insignificant country —‘naked’, observed Johnson, ‘of all vegetable decoration’.
Coastal erosion, the advance of the sands, had interested him insofar as it had destroyed the estate of a landowner who then chose to relinquish the property rather than pay the requisite taxes.
At Ellon, where the modern road forks right over the bridge on the A92, and a pretty walk runs along by the river Ythan, the landlady of an inn where they breakfasted wished she had remembered to show to this great doctor (of whom they had heard) a child of hers with a chronic lump in his throat.
Useless for Boswell to point out that notwithstanding the title ‘Doctor’, physick did not belong in Johnson's otherwise comprehensive repertoire, and here it was that the landlord made a distinction which so pleased Johnson: ‘They say he is the greatest man in England, except Lord Mansfield.’
Without the qualification, Johnson felt the remark would have been devoid of enjoyable meaning.
He understood the depth of the compliment: the landlord had compared him favourably with that greatest of heroes, a local boy made good (so long, of course, as he makes good far away).
Mansfield, from Perth, progressed through the law to a political career of unusual prominence at Westminster.
Some miles beyond Ellon, the A92 bifurcates: the right-hand fork becomes the A952 which eventually leads to Peterhead and its gaol by the sea.
Boswell and Johnson took this road to Cruden Bay, in order to fulfil an invitation put in train by a lady they had met at worship in Aberdeen on Sunday morning.
Lord and Lady Errol owned Slains Castle, a wide pile on the land's edge: the pair arrived as the dinner bell rang at three in the afternoon.
This timing gives some idea of how long their travelling habitually took: still in a post-chaise, and allowing an hour, say, for breakfast, they required seven hours or so to travel a distance of about twenty-eight miles.
The variations within that calculation are not extreme — perhaps an extra half-hour at breakfast; perhaps they did not leave Aberdeen precisely (Boswell says ‘about eight in the morning’), perhaps the road wound around to make thirty miles.
Even with the wind of generosity at their back, why did they travel at a man's walking pace?
It seems likely that the condition of the roads had begun to grow uneven after Aberdeen: today, upon leaving the main road, the castle, now ruined, may  only be approached on pockmarked and muddy lanes, and if these approximate to the surfaces upon which Johnson had to travel once he entered a remoter Scotland, his pace may be understood and excused, and his courage further applauded.
Whether viewed from the high road, or across the low fences and stone ditches and grassy banks of the surrounding farms, the ruin of Slains looks familiar.
Not so much in appearance as in mood, a fact which could owe to the Gothic-ness of another literary association.
This is where Bram Stoker reputedly completed his novel Dracula, which was published in 1897.
His lore says that Abraham Stoker, a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, had given faithful service as general amanuensis to Sir Henry Irving, the fearsome Victorian actor-manager — for whom Stoker had given up his civil service career.
When Stoker approached him with a play intended for his master, Irving, taking no thought of the devotion shown by his factotum, reacted along a scale from dismissiveness to contempt.
Whereupon Stoker, gifted with Dublin's malice, wrote instead a novel — about a bloodsucking, ennobled gentleman whose business was carried on at night, in or around grand dramatic buildings.
If the cap fitted Irving, presumably he could wear it.
Slains may be approached in two ways: comfortably by means of a long quiet climbing lane from the trees on the edge of Cruden, or more adventurously, once alighted from the bus on the upper road, between stone walls, along that wide lane of sticky brown clay, perilously full of holes.
As I walked by, someone's car stuck there and would not move, and a neighbouring farmer, irritably habituated to such incident, hauled it to the road with his tractor.
Just inside the entrance proper, the sea slices a vicious swathe inland, describing almost a half-circle.
Boswell says, ‘We walked round the house till stopped by a cut made by the influx of the sea.
The house is quite built upon the shore; the windows look upon the main ocean, and the King of Denmark is Lord Errol's nearest neighbour on the north-east.’
Note — the King of Denmark, not a farmer, or a Danish crofter: Boswell the consistent upward aspirant.
Confusion may arise regarding Slains, where two castles exist.
One, a little farther up the coast, is called ‘Old Slains’ and was built several centuries earlier: it is now ruined far beyond the one in which Boswell and Johnson stayed.
Old Slains stands even more perilously close to the North Sea cliffs, and in high weather the waves climb and spray the windows of the people who live in the houses under the shadow of Old Slains's remaining high wall.
A cannon or two have been placed around a modern Scandinavian-type house, more for ornament than effectiveness.
At that eighteenth-century mid-afternoon table in ‘new’ Slains, sat Lady Errol, Charles Boyd — Lord Errol's brother whom the visitors first mistook to be the earl — and some of the Errol children with their tutor and governess.
Acquaintance was renewed between Mr Boyd and Dr Johnson: they had met ‘at Cumming the Quaker's’(whose principles Johnson once called upon to illuminate an argument with Boswell.
Tom Cumming, on account of his religious denomination, said he would not fight in the 1745 Rebellion, but would drive an ammunition cart: Johnson's point had to do with the difference between religious texts meant to be taken literally, and those intended for general guidance.)
After lunch, Lady Errol paraded all her children — six girls, two boys.
Johnson soon wished to leave, and pressed Boswell, who, of his very nature, did not want to go until he had met the Earl.
Lady Errol intervened through her brother-in-law, informing Johnson, in the hyperbole of hospitality, that she would never allow him to enter Slains again if he left now, and, with the daylight of the long summer evening available, she provided her coachman so that the travellers could view a couple of local geological curiosities, the Buller of Buchan and the rock of Dunbui.
When his Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides appeared, Boswell's reflections caused him some trouble, including threats of actual bodily harm from people he mentioned.
As all third parties do, we may delight in his indiscretions — but Charles Boyd did not, nor did any Scots of allied sympathies.
‘Mr Boyd was engaged, in 1745 — 6, on the same side with many unfortunate mistaken noblemen and gentlemen’— meaning he was among those on the Stuart side at Culloden and elsewhere.
Nor did Boswell the North Briton confine himself to political toadying to London, as he swung from compliments to conveyed slights: ‘[Mr Boyd]entertained us with great civility.
He had a pompousness or formal plenitude in his conversation, which I did not dislike.
Dr Johnson said ‘there was too much elaboration in his talk.’’
Mr Boyd had escaped to France after the ‘45, had married a French wife, who now lived with him in Aberdeen, and he tried his best to cure the local people using the knowledge he had gained from some medical text-books he found in a house on the island of Arran while on the run.
The wind coming off the North Sea along here can skin your lips, even on a day when the sun appears to be shining.
Some of the fields surrounding Slains castle had unkempt crops in them, awaiting tending, prior to lifting.
The sea's cut into Slains's yard is as deep and threatening as a wound, and on the far side, only a little sward exists between the front of the castle and the cliff standing over the water.
Inside, the ruin is elaborate, a warren of old rooms and passages.
The house's former importance can be measured according to its size, exquisite, courageous location, and the remains of huge fireplaces.
‘From the windows’ wrote Johnson, ‘the eye wanders over the sea that separates Scotland from Norway, and when the winds beat with violence must enjoy all the terrifick grandeur of the tempestuous ocean.
I would not for my amusement wish for a storm; but as storms, whether wished or not, will sometimes happen, I may say, without violation of humanity, that I should willingly look out upon them from Slanes [sic]castle.’
This is a formidable ruin.
From here, Norse longboats were sighted, ever before a castle was raised: fishing-boats must have perished within earshot; the sunlight on the water (to paraphrase Louis MacNeice's poem) hardened and grew cold.
It is possible to see the weather from a long way off, but as the people at Old Slains know, the weather then arrives at such speed over the surface of the North Sea that seeing it approach seems hardly sufficient warning.
Bram Stoker may have been a genial enough fellow externally, but he knew how to find a place which would match the chill in the soul of his novel.
When they drove out from the castle, Johnson found little in Dunbui's yellow rock to engage his attention, other than the remarkable fact that the Guillemot, known locally as the Coot, while as small as a duck, lays eggs as large as those of a goose.
The Buller of Buchan had more appeal, and he summarised it with glittering accuracy: ‘It has the appearance of a vast well bordered with a wall.’
Here, the sea has eroded a cavity, which could only be refilled with a deep plug of rock, a column pegged into the hole.
Johnson wrote, ‘The edge of the Buller is not wide, and to those that walk round, appears very narrow.’
Johnson braved the walk.
‘He that ventures to look downward sees, that if his foot should slip, he must fall from this dreadful elevation upon stones on one side, or into water on the other.
We however went round, and were glad when the circuit was completed.’
Boswell felt discomfort, albeit at the sight of Johnson striding irregularly along.
Johnson then insisted on descending to the shore and boating into the basin itself, which was entered by means of vigorous rowing to the very entrance, then, oars shipped, by Gliding the rest of the way, as the extended oars would not squeeze through the opening — although they might today, after two centuries of further erosion.
Mr Boyd told them that the name ‘Buller’ derived from the French bouloir, reduced by local folk to ‘the Pot’, in which cauldron Dr Johnson now gambolled with a certain heartiness, speculating upon the depth of the caves, and their uses for smugglers and pirates, or shelters for boatmen: Mr Boyd also told them of people from Peterhead holding picnics in one of the caverns.
They returned to the castle for tea and coffee in the drawing-room.
Mr Boyd had patients waiting, a fact I do not quite understand, since he had just told Boswell and Johnson the story of one of Lord Errol's tenants.
Too far from Aberdeen for convenient medicine, the Earl, in order to have his own surgeon, had the son of one of his tenants thus educated.
Came a day when the man revealed that he had kept an exact account of all the money laid out on him, and could now, in his unexpectedly good situation in life, Pay every penny back to his benefactor.
‘The earl,’ reports  Boswell, ‘was pleased with the generous gratitude and genteel offer of the man; but refused it.’
By the bow-window Johnson, probably inspired by the potential fury of the sea, recited Horace's ode Iam satis terris.
I wish Boswell had thought fit to quote as much as Johnson uttered, if only to observe Johnson's intimate, word-perfect familiarity with Horace, and whether he also added a translation.
How far did he go?
The entire fifty-two lines?
Or only down as far as the moment when the Tiber is hurled back violently from the Etruscan shore?
The glimpse of Johnson reflecting on the position of Slains Castle in relation to the perilous sea, displays a man with a capacity for the learned mot juste, surely a gift which Johnson polished, having discovered how he might impress with it.
With Mr Boyd ministering, and Lady Errol attending to her children, Boswell and Johnson passed the time — it will have been close to, or even after, seven o'clock by now— chatting quietly, admiring the sea view, inspecting the pictures, including a portrait of Lord Errol by their ‘amiable and elegant friend’, of whom Johnson observed, concluding some complimentary remarks, ‘Sir Joshua Reynolds is the most invulnerable man I know; the man with whom if you should quarrel, you would find the most difficulty how to abuse.’
Being in a noble house, they discussed inheritance of land by means of‘entails’, the settling of land upon members of a family in a predetermined order to prevent any one owner or inheritor bequeathing it outside the family.
Three years later, this question would much trouble Boswell.
When his father raised the question of who should inherit the estate after him, and whether he should choose ‘heirs general’, that is to say, include females in the vexed question — in an earlier generation, four sisters had been passed over in favour of a Boswell nephew — Boswell consulted Johnson repeatedly, before the matter was resolved to Boswell's general satisfaction.
(He subsequently became an excellent landlord at Auchinleck.)
It also troubled Peggie Boswell, and arose in those memorable letters between herself and Johnson.
Johnson declared himself in favour of such prescribed succession: ‘His opinion was that so much land should be entailed as that families should never fall into contempt, and as much left free as to give them all the advantages in case of any emergency.’
In this cake-and-eat-it arrangement, no one possessor could sell off the estate, yet in Johnson's view, the landowner should have enough over and above the inheritance to bargain with, should he need to raise cash by sale or mortgage, but never so much as to disinherit his succeeding generations.
Works by Hogarth hung in the gallery at Slains: the library contained ‘a valuable numerous collection’, and Boswell renders one of his usual excellent off-the-cuff services to our understanding of eighteenth-century domestic arrangements: ‘The noble owner has built of brick, along the square on the inside, a gallery, both on the first and second story, the house being no higher; so that he has always a dry walk, and the rooms, to which formerly there was no approach but through each other, have now all separate entries from the gallery.’
The noble owner returned around nine o'clock, and renewed his acquaintance with Dr Johnson, with whom he had once dined in London.
Here, Boswell raises again the widest of smiles, at the sight of his heart, pulsating with snobbery, on his sleeve: ‘I was exceedingly pleased with Lord Errol.
His dignified person and agreeable countenance, with the most unaffected affability gave me high satisfaction.
From perhaps a weakness, or, as I rather hope, more fancy and warmth of feeling than is quite reasonable, my mind is ever impressed with admiration for persons of high birth, and I could, with the most perfect honesty, expatiate on Lord Errol's good qualities; but he stands in no need of my praise.’
(Just as well in all the circumstances.)
Time to leave Slains.
Even a warm sun could not mellow the North Sea breeze, and falling stones here and there warned against following the outlines of the gallery too closely.
On that night, Tuesday, 24 August 1773, they talked of murderers being hanged — Lord Errol must have had a fund of such stories: he was the Lord High Constable of Scotland; then they drank port, and were seen to their rooms by their host himself.
Boswell had a fire in his ‘most elegant’ room overlooking the sea, but he did not sleep well because the sea made its wild noises, and the pillows were stuffed with the feathers of ‘some sea-fowl, which had to me a disagreeable smell’.
He also called to mind the noble Earl's father, Lord Kilmarnock, beheaded in London for his part in the '45; the son who hosted Boswell and Johnson broke with the family's rebellious tradition and sided with the King and London.
On the field at Culloden, the last of the Boyd clan horse had been disarrayed and the strength reduced to footsoldiering.
The old earl had raised his army on account of a personal admiration for Bonnie Prince Charlie, and Kilmarnock's Horse Grenadiers rode south with the Jacobites on their foray to Derby.
One of his two sons who served in the British Army fought on Culloden Moor with the Royal Scots Fusiliers.
Kilmarnock was held in reserve, but, as the day collapsed, he rode forward into the Stuart Second Line, which soon became a bedraggled ribbon neither in the van nor the rear.
The Earl lost his men in the mist and the smoke, and mistakenly appealed to those near him — not only Cumberland's soldiers, but Scots Fusiliers, who took him prisoner.
The old man had lost his hat, and wept tears of shame at his forced surrender.
In one of Culloden's many poignant legends, a tall and impressive Fusilier officer came forward and, bowing low, offered the Earl his own hat; it was, of course, his own son, James, the noble Lord Errol who entertained Boswell and Johnson.
A Gothic castle on the edge of the cold waters, on treeless cliffs where boats founder, where villages vanish ghostlily in shifting  sands, and a reef where once a year appear the ragged bodies of all ever wrecked thereon — it begets legend.
How it suited Bram Stoker for his Transylvania.
The red stone gleamed in the sun; the white birds floated on the thermals, wheeling in silent inspection; on the rocks below, other birds screamed now and then.
Reconstruction in Victorian times may have rendered the building even more forbidding.
Wolves may not howl here in the moonlight, as they did in the journal of Jonathan Harker, but I have no difficulty in seeing Slains as he saw Count Dracula's castle in Bukovina, the tall black windows from which not a glimmer of light came, and the jagged battlements glimpsed when the moon came out from behind the fitful clouds.
Stoker had a poorly childhood in Dublin, and he grew up in the city of Sheridan Le Fanu who took opium and drank green tea, and wrote a truly dreadful tale about a lamia by name of Carmilla, who, as lamias often do, set out to suck the blood from a virginal girl called Laura.
It interests me not a little that Sheridan Le Fanu should have found in Dublin sufficient inspiration to write the story of a horrendous shark-like sorceress: Carmilla's real name was, with appropriate euphony, Countess Karnstein, and when her grave was excavated, her body was found to float in many inches of blood.
Anything else would have been inappropriate.
Before he wrote Dracula, Stoker, by then a civil servant, published a rather different book: Duties of Clerks of Petty Sessions in Ireland, and in the year of its publication, 1878, began his business association with Irving.
Whatever influence Le Fanu's works may have had on Stoker, the young Dublin boy must have known that in the prevalent Celtic legends the graves open all over the Irish  countyside on All Souls’ Night and the dead walk across the fields — and Irving's performances and demeanour sealed the future of his fictional imagination.
Stoker watched Irving on stage night after night.
Contemporary accounts recorded Irving's capacity for the eerie.
Prone to throwing the stage into complete darkness, he then allowed a single candle, or dancing firelight, to illuminate his face, while the stage manager cast a white calcium beam on the actor's head.
Max Beerbohm described Irving as having ‘an incomparable power for eeriness, for stirring a dim sense of  mystery; and not less masterly was he in invoking a dim sense of horror’.
Having seen all of this, Stoker, they say, told Irving he wished not only to administer Irving's theatrical affairs, but to write for the great man.
Hence the laughter, hence the wounded feelings, hence the novel about a man who works in darkness and lives off the lifeblood of others.
A guest of the Errols at Slains, Stoker later retired to Whinnyfold, southwards a little along the coast.
The original ‘new’ castle began here at the end of the sixteenth century; developments a century later added the bow window in which Johnson stood looking out at Norway, and repeating the words of his ancient star, Horace — in the same room as Boswell wished for an introduction to the King of Denmark.
Its outline may still be traced despite the extensive Victorianisation of 1836, which clad the original structure with granite facings and extended upwards and sideways.
From 1925, when the roof was taken away, ruin took over and spread throughout.
It was just past mid-day, and noon does not dim the ruin's eeriness.
The journey immediately ahead held little of interest from the Johnson and Boswell point of view, and nothing much, therefore, to look forward to until the Forres of Macbeth's witches.
Along the road, another glimpse of the Buller of Buchan: they claim that in stormy weather the waves crash over the top of the Buller, a full two hundred feet.
Now the slanting sun struck deep into the Buller's shark-angled mouth, and a tongue of almost Mediterranean blue slavered at the rocks far below.
‘All was rudeness, silence and solitude’
JOHNSON FOUND THE LAND after Slains ‘neither uncultivated nor unfruitful: but it was all still arable.
Of flocks or herds there was no appearance.’
Playing his new-found tune, he wrote, ‘I had now travelled two hundred miles in Scotland and seen only one tree not younger than myself.’
Many lands in Scotland may then have lain more fallow than they should; however, new, post-Culloden initiatives led to ever greater cultivation in this quiet territory north-west of Slains towards Inverness.
‘We dined this day,’ writes Johnson, ‘at the house of Mr Frazer of Streichton, who shewed us in his grounds some stones yet standing of a druidical circle, and what I began to think more worthy of notice, some forest trees of full growth.’
Boswell has a different spelling —‘Strichen’, and so it is today: and he gives a direction to the place: ‘we went four miles out of our road, after passing Old Deer, and went thither.’
Which means that from Slains they took some old route perhaps across the Moss of Cruden, then crossed where the A92 runs now, and from the modern A950, or a comparable road, went up to Strichen through the Forest of Deer: today's byroads may have been old lanes or drovers' trails.
Strichen, so orderly and serene, was a ‘planned village’, established to lure tradesmanship and manufacturers to Lord Strichen's estate.
Newspaper advertisements hailed the convenience and amenities of the place; specifications were laid down as to the length and style of houses.
The imposed regularity of the architecture gives the village its still pleasant air, an unexpected oasis of prosperous history, almost a tiny Edinburgh among the trees.
Odd that Johnson did not take note of Strichen, whose  development was in full swing when he called there for his Wednesday lunch.
That a village should be created, rather than grow from an organic root, such as a river ford, or a crossing of forest paths, would surely have drawn a mot from him.
In the early eighteenth century, rural management in Scotland had begun to change.
The estate owners tightened their systems, with a view to greater productivity — new breeds, crops, implements and methods.
They founded two germane organisations in the 1720s — the Honourable Society of Improvers in the Knowledge of Agriculture, and the Board of Trustees for Fisheries and Manufactures in Scotland.
So the ‘planned village’ emerged — designed to keep people within the realm of the estate but not necessarily dependent on it.
Estate owners had begun to find the grazing of animals more profitable per acre than the tenanting of farmers.
In theory, the planned village would absorb the people displaced by the new, more commercial economics of farming; the population would be kept in the countryside, thereby impeding an early flight from the land.
Instead of tenanting, the locals would become the focus of rural manufacturing.
Village foundation was to be yet another example of developing the total resources of the estate, and in such enterprises the landowner was supposed to display concern for his former tenants newly displaced.
The broadest classification of this development fell into three categories of village — estate, textile and fishing.
Estate villages provided houses for tradesmen, foresters, and other estate workers; they would be paid wages rather than be allowed to take their own living from estate lands, no more grazing of their own sheep and cattle.
Textile villages (the most numerous) and factory villages were founded on water-power sites.
Flax mills and handweavers — also useful generally because they helped at the harvest and other farm-intensive moments — came to these villages which were advertised as having little plots of land, enough to sustain a cow, and enough peat to keep a family fireplace burning, and enough life in general to support those married, or intending to marry.
The advertisement placed by Lord Strichen in an Aberdeenshire newspaper in November 1763 offered stone to build with; lime for the land; ‘a weekly market and four great fairs annually; the  situation is within six miles of nine fish towns and would be a most convenient receptacle for all persons concerned in the linen manufactureys, and there is already plenty of yarn spun in the country…’
When Johnson and Boswell visited Strichen, Mr Fraser had a wealthy and palatial mansion.
Its Victorian replacement, with long drives and a portico of columns, has fallen into disuse.
The druidical temple which Johnson saw would have proved extremely difficult for me to find, were it not for the presence in Strichen of one of the most useful guiding systems on earth — a group of local schoolboys idling on their bicycles.
One boy had been taken there by his grandfather, and he knew the way exactly.
The formal directions of a local guide book say, ‘Turn off A981 Fraserburgh/New Deer Road 1.3 km S of Strichen and fork right in 250m.
Park on track to cottage and pass along right hand side of house and uphill for 400m.’
Technically speaking, this will certainly lead to the semi-recumbent stone circle of Strichen in the district of Banff and Buchan — but the dry guidebook makes no mention of a long, glorious stone wall, part of an old kitchen garden boundary; in the distance loomed the huge ruined house of the Frasers.
The gardens are gone; herds of cattle grazed in the forecourt.
Erected in the third or second century B.C., the circle now sits in its original position once again.
Not long after Johnson saw it, a tenant farmer demolished it, wishing, perhaps, to use the stones for his own building, like the Greeks who lived near Delphi, or the old villagers of Avebury — but the landowner, presumably the same Mr Fraser, had him rebuild it.
The farmer cannot have known of ancient alignments, and his reconstruction did not accord with the circle's original orientation on the southern moon.
In due course, another demolition took place, and then in the late 1970s, archaeologists on an excavation returned the stones to their original precise locations.
On the cold hill, a fence now surrounds the circle, and it interferes not at all with the mood or countenance of the rocks.
They march in a track of the moon, and one flat stone, shaped like a tall and very thin rhinoceros, lies between two uprights.
Strichen  circle is a smaller, domestic version of the great stone rings.
A few men at a time could have manipulated each of these stones into position, yet the collective force of the place feels not reduced accordingly.
This owes as much to the location of the ring, as to the size of the stones: given the view across the countryside, with nearby lower hills, and distant smooth green fields, a full moon over Strichen will have conveyed powerful mystery.
Neither Boswell nor Johnson recorded much here.
It may be that depredations had occurred before they got to Strichen; Boswell, who had visited fifteen years earlier, clearly expected more from the druidical circle, although whether to impress Johnson further, or to avoid being thought an inaccurate provider of anticipations, is difficult to tell, as he does not expand beyond saying, ‘…
But I had augmented it in my mind; for all that remains is two stones set up on end, with a long one laid upon them, as was usual, and one stone at a little distance from them.
That stone was the capital one of the circle which surrounded what now remains.’
Strichen lies a little way down from the left shoulder of Scotland along which they travelled to reach Inverness.
After they left the druids' circle at Strichen, Boswell and Johnson exchanged a number of observations, the first of which had been an expression of compassion for Mr Fraser.
Boswell here lets fly with a breath-taking assumption that country folk had a lonely, miserable time: ‘I had a most disagreeable [that is to say distressing]notion of the life of a country gentleman,’ and he left Mr Fraser, he said, ‘as one leaves a prisoner in a jail’.
Johnson, who should have known better, believed Boswell right in assuming such folk unhappy, ‘for that they had not enough to keep their minds in motion’.
They seem to have disregarded one immediately evident aspect of Mr Fraser's life; it being Fair Day at Strichen he had guests at lunch, one of whom had at least been sufficiently energetic to have attended a lecture Dr Johnson gave at Lichfield.
To enliven their dull stretch to Banff, Boswell had started a conversational entertainment, into which Johnson entered merrily — that their famous Literary Club in London should take over St Andrews university, and thereby rebuild the city.
Founded in  1764, the Club was not (as is often assumed) Johnson's brain-child: Boswell's Life makes it clear that the idea came from Joshua Reynolds; and once a week they met at seven in the evening, in the Turk's Head, a Soho hostelry.
The original dozen members, who included Goldsmith and Edmund Burke, grew to thirty-five members by 1773, and, according to Boswell's footnote, had moved premises more than once — but always to a place where liquor could be had.
They also changed their rules of gathering, confining themselves to a fortnightly meeting during Parliament's sessions.
The membership comprised lords, writers, debaters, academics, men of opinion and strong mind, some bishops, dukes and gentlemen.
Garrick joined, and Adam Smith, thereby ensuring that Johnson did not always have the discourse his own way.
Now, on the chaise to Banff, Boswell planned with Johnson that they would regenerate the University of St Andrews according to the abilities or conceits of the Club members, each of whom would be granted a Faculty or two.
Garrick would teach public speaking; ‘Goldsmith, poetry and ancient history…
Reynolds, painting, and the arts which have beauty for their object.’
Johnson at first declared ‘I'll trust theology to nobody but myself,’ then gave way a little to Bishop Percy, but held on to logic, metaphysics and scholastic divinity.
This was not a conversation they could safely have had within earshot of any educated Scot.
After Strichen, Banff, where verification of their visit takes little time; a plaque on a wall reads: ‘Site of the Black Bull Inn visited by Johnson and Boswell, 1773’.
Although Johnson twice found the hillocky little town lacking —‘At night we came to Bamff [sic], where I remember nothing that particularly claimed my attention’; and ‘Finding nothing to detain us at Bamff, we set out in the morning’— he yet managed to write a short exercise in observation of Scottish small borough architecture.
Intrigued by the means of domestic entrance —‘often by a flight of steps, which reaches up to the second story, the floor which is level with the ground being entered only by stairs descending within the house,— lie compares their dwellings with the architecture of England, and inevitably, when he draws such comparisons, a little bee flies into his bonnet.
In Banff, he sounded off about windows.
He did not like that  leaded panes rarely featured here; nor that, instead of hinges, they had a sash-and-pulley arrangement, meaning the windows did not easily stay open.
Ever a man for taking the particular to exhibit the general, this allowed him a global crack at the Scots: he claimed that they were not interested in doing anything unless it had natural awkwardness in it: ‘What cannot be done without some uncommon trouble or particular expedient, will not often be done at all.
The incommodiousness of Scotch windows keeps them very closely shut…even in houses well built and elegantly furnished, a stranger may be sometimes forgiven if he allows himself to wish for fresher air.’
Too sniffy and cursory for today's friendly Banff with its many tractors and willing hospitality: the hotel being closed, the lady behind the counter in the newsagents offered to make me Dr Johnson's pleasure, a cup of tea.
Johnson and Boswell both pay little attention to this leg of the journey, and skip quickly on.
At breakfast next morning in Cullen the Great Bear met Arbroath smokies.
When served with ‘dried haddocks broiled’, Boswell reports, ‘Dr Johnson was disgusted at the sight of them, so they were removed.’
From Cullen, where they got a fresh chaise ‘and very good horses’, to Elgin is a distance of about twenty-five miles, through whiskified Speyside.
It rained upon them at Elgin and Johnson again ran into culinary difficulty with a lunch he could not eat at the Red Lion inn.
He complained, not at length: ‘This was the first time, and except one, the last, that I found any reason to complain of a Scotish [sic]table, and such disappointments, I suppose, must be expected in every country, where there is no great frequence of travellers.’
Boswell echoed briefly; ‘We fared but ill at our inn here.’
When Johnson's Journey appeared, sensitivities combusted spontaneously in Scotland.
His negative comments, however accurate, were converted into slights, compounded by Johnson's nationality and famous stature.
Reactions divided typically — between outright rebuttal, angry repudiation of the invader, and reasoned explanation.
Elgin became a good example of the reaction to Johnson in Scotland.
Regarding the Red Lion lunch, the town searched its soul, and more than a century later was still justifying the inedible  meal.
It seems that the landlord of the Red Lion, called Leslie, and held up as an elegant fellow, instigated enquiries as to how such food came to be served to Johnson, and the following explanation emerged.
One of the inn's habitués, a commercial traveller named Thomas Paufer, bore an uncanny resemblance to Johnson.
This Paufer preferred drinking to eating, and spent his slim budget proportionately.
The staff of the Red Lion became habituated to Paufer's arrangements; accordingly they mistakenly served Johnson the kind of secondary food doled out to drunken Paufer.
That is their story.
The faithful in Scotland called Elgin Cathedral ‘The Lanthorn of the North’, drawing them to the peace and Christian power of the place, and its light still shines through the ruined windows and stone crosses: moss, whether on old garden walls, or as here, in ancient grounds, encourages reflection.
Johnson pondered the ruin of the building: ‘The church of Elgin had, in the intestine tumults of the barbarous ages, been laid waste by the irruption of a highland chief, whom the bishop had offended.’
Two centuries later, a second dilapidation occurred, when the roof leads were stripped to make coinage for military upkeep.
In later times, castles and great houses in Ireland, the possession of absentee landlords, suffered likewise when local plunderers exploited the international need for lead in the manufacture of munitions.
Elgin's roof-leads, with those of Aberdeen Cathedral, went to the bottom of the sea when the ship foundered on a voyage to Holland, and Johnson invited every reader to ‘rejoice that this cargo of sacrilege was lost’.
Notwithstanding the former grandeur of the Cathedral, Johnson wrote no more than a page on Elgin, concluding with an attractive clue to a traveller in his wake: ‘In the chief street of Elgin, the houses jut over the lowest story, like the old buildings of timber in London, but with greater prominence: so that there is sometimes a walk for a considerable length under a cloister, or portico.’
Although, long before Johnson, Daniel Defoe found Elgin ‘a very agreeable place to live in’— those gentry not wishing to venture as far as Edinburgh or London came in from the Highlands  for the winter — Elgin's time came later: a half-century after our heroes' visit, it became a little classical Victorian market town whose streets and suburbs echoed Edinburgh's New Town in elegance and spaciousness.
Boswell dismisses Elgin in a couple of paragraphs, partly though boredom, partly embarrassment at Johnson's bad meal there; but again — the invaluable gloss on Johnson's version —; Boswell liked the jutting arcades, which he called ‘piazzas’; he approved of ‘such structures in a town, on account of their conveniency in wet weather’, and then reports Johnson's dislike of them on account of the way in which they made ‘the under story of a house very dark, which greatly over-balances the conveniency, when it is considered how small a part of the year it rains.
In the grounds of the Elgin Cathedral, I mentioned to a passing man, a local, with whom I had fallen into conversation, ‘Dr Johnson had a meal here, that was so bad he couldn't eat it.’
‘When was that?’ he asked.
‘In August 1773.’
‘Ach,’ he said.
‘He could have had the same yesterday.’
On the road from Elgin to Forres, about twelve miles long, Johnson quoted: Boswell says that Johnson's recitation —‘he repeated a good deal more of Macbeth’— was ‘grand and affecting’, after which Johnson, in a parody of the witches, aimed a pleasant dart at Boswell.
‘I had purchased some land called Dalblair; and, as in Scotland it is customary to distinguish landed men by the name of their estates, I had thus two titles, Dalblair and Young Auchinleck.
So, my friend in imitation of ‘All hail Macbeth! hail to thee Thane of Cawdor!’ condescended to amuse himself with uttering ‘All hail Dalblair! hail to thee, Laird of Auchinleck!’’
Johnson treats the same Thursday afternoon as follows: ‘We   was travelling, when he met the weird sisters on his way.
This to an Englishman is classic ground.
Our imaginations were heated, and our thoughts recalled to their old amusements.’
Shakespeare transfixed Johnson all his life.
When he was nine he read Hamlet, no doubt a copy from his father's bookshop, and, as he told Mrs Thrale later, when he came to the ghost scene he left the kitchen fireside and stood reading at the street door in Lichfield in order to ‘have people about’.
Fanny Burney said to Johnson that Shakespeare ‘could never have seen a Caliban’, and Johnson told her that having seen a man Shakespeare knew how to vary one; ‘A man who would draw a monstrous cow, must first know what a cow commonly is; or how can he tell that to give her an ass's head or an elephant's tusk will make her monstrous?’
On his deathbed, he quoted to his physician Macbeth's own words to the doctor attending Lady Macbeth for her ‘thickcoming fancies’; Johnson never loved uncritically.
‘Shakespeare,’ he told Boswell in 1769, ‘never has six lines together without a fault.’
He had studied the plays exhaustively, and published in 1765 a new edition whose Preface has been called the most famous Shakespearean essay ever written.
To equip the definitions in his Dictionary, one third or so of nearly a hundred and twenty thousand quotations come from Shakespeare — many, it seems, chosen as much for their philosophical or moral point as for their usage value.
Of the plays, Macbeth appears to have received his greatest attention, and, in 1745, while still in his thirties and making his literary way, he produced his ‘Miscellaneous Observations on the Tragedy of Macbeth’, which begins: ‘In order to make a true estimate of the abilities and merit of a writer it is always necessary to examine the genius of his age and the opinions of his contemporaries.’
It is an astonishing essay, full of large generosity to the reader, delivered by way of glosses and fearlessly-held, warmly-offered opinions.
It contains no pretentiousness, has scarcely dated, and throws out many lessons — not least Johnson's writerly good manners: if he uses a Greek tag he gives the translation.
The Preface fetches information from other ages and brings it forward, and hands it to us, cleansed and ready for consumption, and presented in a style that makes it clear Johnson wished to be read.
Through it all runs the most noble assumption — that no human need be daunted by the stature even of a genius such as Shakespeare, that his wisdoms and magics are for us all and that Johnson himself is an eager and willing guide.
If, in Nabokov's assertion, a writer may be a storyteller, a teacher, or an enchanter, and a great writer all three — Dr Johnson, even in this academic territory, long rendered prosaic and often inaccessible by other writers, was already a great writer at the age of thirty-five.
To read Macbeth with Johnson's ‘Miscellaneous Observations’ open alongside is a great pleasure.
Example: ‘The arguments by which Lady Macbeth persuades her husband to commit the murder afford a proof of Shakespeare's knowledge of human nature.
She urges the excellence and dignity of courage, a glittering idea which has dazzled mankind from age to age and animated sometimes the housebreaker and sometimes the conqueror.’
To this gloss on the idea that even a thief should have to screw his courage to the sticking-place, Johnson adds the argument that if all else he had written were lost, Shakespeare should have become immortal for the way in which he shows Macbeth ‘distinguishing true from false fortitude in a line and a half’: In Johnson's footsteps, these roads across Scotland's shoulder become Shakespeare country.
The travellers each commented only on the ‘admirable’ inn where they stayed overnight in Forres.
‘At Fores,’ writes Johnson, ‘we found good accommodation, but nothing worthy of particular remark, and next morning entered upon the road on which Macbeth heard the fatal prediction; but we travelled on not interrupted by promises of kingdoms.’
Sueno's Stone, or ‘King Duncan's Monument’, as Boswell calls it, stands on the edge of the bypass.
Once thought to commemorate a Viking encounter, but now believed to be a Class III Pictish monument, centuries older, Sueno's Stone has panels and friezes of headless corpses, horsemen, battles or skulls.
I saw nothing of them: the eight-yard-high obelisk was swathed in wooden bandages, as impenetrable as Scott's Monument had been in Edinburgh.
Beyond Forres, in the open countryside, stands Brodie Castle, now a National Trust property, a tall sixteenth-century building on a long-inhabited site, direct from the frames of a Disney film of Rob Roy or Alan Breck.
Groves of trees, carefully planted, give shelter.: Brodies of Brodie date back nine centuries.
Turn right off the road to Nairn, by the castle, then past woods by a duck-thronged mere, turn to the west, that is, left, off the lane into a similarly tight by-road and, around a corner, stands Macbeth's Hillock.
Macbeth fought King Duncan in 1040, and killed him, perhaps near Elgin, not far from Lossie Forest.
Presumably Shakespeare researched his play in Holinshed's histories — but how could he have known of the eeriness of atmosphere available all around here?
The folk of these towns and villages took their convicted witches, stood them in pitch-filled barrels and set them afire: in Forres stands a witches' stone, site of such burnings — in thunder, lightning, or in rain?
At Macbeth's Hillock, the grue rises a little cold on the nape of the neck.
A round, gradual, shallow cone, the Hillock has, at first sight, no context: it stands in the middle of a field, growing scrabby grass, an egregious lone breast.
Unlike the ‘fairy forts’ in Ireland, it bears no evidence of fortification, and seems not to have been inhabited.
From its easily-reached little summit not much of a view — therefore, it cannot have been a hill-fort: in the tradition of Maiden Castle, or the great Heuneberg in Danubian Germany, this is not even a bungalow.
Yet, to the north, a couple of hundred yards away, lie a series of long, barrow-like earthworks.
Maybe they are recent, agricultural bulldozings — or, in this gathering dusk, antiquities, entirely consistent in shape, length and intensity with ancient burial places from Poland to Galway, early European shapes.
Which would mean that Shakespeare had Macbeth meet the witches in as moody a place as a writer could conceive — an ancient cemetery.
Locally this area is known as the ‘hard muir’, with the term ‘Macbeth's Hillock’ thought to be a Victorian fancy.
Might a dig at Macbeth's Hillock, in concert with textual sleuthing, yield exotic fruit — the skeletons, perhaps, of three witches in one coffin, with a shrivelled newt or toad nearby?
Whatever the reticence of archaeologists on the matter — perhaps they fear being thought fanciful by their academic colleagues — excavations have begun to confirm the details in legends and myths.
The ‘Celtic Tutankhamun’ in Stuttgart Museum, a chieftain from the fifth century B.C., was decked out head to foot in the kind of gold hero-gods wear in Celtic myth.
In Shakespeare too, the art mirrors the life.
Sir Peter Hall, researching a new production of The Merchant of Venice, discovered in the archives that the Bard's father was prosecuted twice for usury.
‘At Nairn we may fix the verge of the Highlands, for here I first saw peat fires and heard the Erse language.’
To reach this point Johnson has taken up a third of his Journey to the Western Islands, and one can now sense the lift of excitement in him, a man about to broach the exotic.
So unlike the attitude of his equally famous French contemporary: nine years earlier, Boswell ‘mentioned our design to Voltaire.
He looked at me, as if I had talked of going to the North Pole.’
Johnson said of the royal burgh of Nairn, ‘If once it flourished,[it]is now in a state of miserable decay.’
It has evidently come on since then.
I intended to stay longer than their short breakfast stop — because this is the town of David Thomson, who spent part of his childhood here; his late adolescence and young manhood in Ireland; his maturity as a writer and BBC radio producer.
The fascination of writing is the attempt to render personal experience into objective beauty and understanding, how to take the fleeting run of life and suspend it, turn it to something tangible, capable of being perused, of being learnt from by others, beginning with the passionate subjective, ending in the dispassionate objective.
Discovering Johnson raises the issue of whether this is best done in fiction, where the imagination would seem to have freer rein, or in non-fiction, a more finite, circumscribed form.
In Samuel Johnson and David Thomson, Nairn created a happy conjunction of two men who turned the factual stuff of their lives into beauty: not by great timeless plot, nor by intricate, archetypal and immortally-spoken characterisation, as Shakespeare did, but by felicity of spirit and language.
Thomson, born in India in 1914, had Scottish parents, and until 1929 spent fourteen years of summer holidays and many other times in his grandmother's family home, Newton, now a hotel, on the edge of Nairn.
He grew to be a knobby-faced, large-headed, academic-looking man, loving and thoughtful, who overcame great difficulties in his inner life — depressions and other emotional waylayings — to produce a small body of-exquisite and delicate work in print and on radio.
The focus of his concerns seem to have lain close to tradition, and although what he wrote may be called natural history and social history, such definitions trammel  him.
When he wrote about seals, as in The People of the Sea; and when he discussed the personality of the hare; and when, in books such as Woodbrook and Nairn in Darkness and Light, he traced the fading and departing of old ways — he might have been writing poems or novels.
He was an artist who viewed the passing of wider tradition as part of his own, and the century's, ageing process.
I met him once, in the late 1980s, a year or so before his death, in a pub in Camden Town: he was a quick, if ageing, inquisitive and half-bolting creature: more for his thick spectacles than his literary associations, other drinkers in the pub called him ‘The Professor’.
In an obituary, Seamus Heaney wrote, ‘There was about him a delicate wildness, and he often thought that the hare, about which he had gathered so many entrancing stories, was his proper, total animal.
Shy, vivid and capable of swift epiphanies.’
In common with Johnson, Thomson had poor eyes.
Their first soreness and troubles led him to Nairn.
After a robust game of rugby football in London — although his sight had never been excellent — his family sent him to his grandmother's up here to give him some rest.
The Newton Hotel is quite easily found, and from Thomson's book I had anticipated its view of the sea, if not quite the shaggy russet Highland cattle grazing in front of the Victorian house.
Before that, I recognised the building under the trees, de luxe bedroom suites now, but still the same structure, on the left-hand side of the drive, just before the sweep around to the hotel steps: ‘The stables which formed part of the rectangle of low buildings out of which that archway to the henyard led, had long been disused but somebody swept them now and then, dusted the curved metal hay racks, wiped manger and woodwork and shone the brass tethering rings so brightly than whenever we pushed a door open and looked into the dusky twilight we were welcomed by a small round gleam of light.’
Light was where he found it: in my room I open Nairn in Darkness and Light at random: windows, lamps, doorways, the sky, night, fire.
And things that mean, or attract, light — flowers, clouds, uniforms with shiny buttons, horse-harness, railway  stations, the waves on the shore, the kettle dancing on the stove.
And things that shut out light: small boxrooms, closed doors; ‘when I snuffed out my bedside candle’; a local history of appalling sandstorms; unfriendly adults of grim, dour mien, with tight acerbic mouths, the ‘grey granite’ stare of a harsh grandmother: he says, ‘I cannot remember ever hearing her use my Christian name in the vocative.’
A colour brochure I picked up in the hall speaks of the ‘27 acres of secluded grounds with magnificent views over the Moray Firth and the Ross-shire hills beyond…imposing combination of Georgian and Scottish Baronial architecture…four course table d'hôte menu of very high class plus an à la carte menu including a range of steaks charcoal grilled…’: no mention of David Thomson.
I also found a modest typed item: ‘Newton or Easter Newton, as it was sometimes designated, was a possession of a branch of the Roses of Kilravock, having been rebuilt in about 1650…’
A bit more promising, it traces the possessors of Newton — Colonels, and Lords, and then the Thomson connection, but this I glean only from Nairn in Darkness and Light: ‘In 1887 Newton was acquired by R. B. Finlay, Q.C.’:
this must be Uncle Robert who said ‘a lengthy grace in Latin, perfectly enunciated’: clearly the same Mr Finlay who was ‘a generous friend to the Golf Club, the new clubhouse, as well as the Newton ground being given to the club in free occupancy’.
The hotel leaflet ends a few paragraphs on: ‘The Newton has had many celebrities who have stayed with us over the years, including the late Harold Macmillan and Charlie Chaplin…’
No mention still of dear David Thomson: the world of publicity does not quickly recognise celebrities (and celebrants) of the inner life.
The hotel is a large, rambling building and I strain my ears to hear the laughter and running feet of the young Thomson, the boy version of the man with the thick glasses and the white cantilever-domed head.
Nairn in Darkness and Light gives us Thomson set in his own history, a man observing his personal continuity in the context of his ancestral surroundings.
He quotes from local antiquarians and contemporary records; ‘Alexander Brodie of Brodie, the Laird of the lands adjoining the Barony of Culbin, kept a detailed diary throughout the years from 1651 until 1680, when he died.
His  public interests were religion, politics and law’; leading to ‘In 1640, on Thursday December the 28th, this Alexander Brodie was one of a party which included my ancestor, the Laird of Innes, that came to the grand old cathedral of Elgin and destroyed every object in it.’
When I first read Nairn (it was published in 1987) I had not been contemplating Johnson: now, in the late sunlight coming through my bedroom window, I rushed to him and Boswell.
No, not enough of a clue as to whether these were the same depredations Johnson had deplored: Elgin had suffered marauders more than once.
A pity: I should have been delighted if the two writers, Johnson and Thomson, could achieve a time-machine meeting over the vandalising of Elgin Cathedral.
In fact, had Johnson been made aware, in any sort of detail, of the destructiveness of Thomson's ancestor, he would have written much more heatedly: Thomson's account continues, ‘They tore down and ripped medieval paintings, smashed the screen which was beautifully carved, probably gilded like most ancient screens, and adorned in patterns of blue, red and green.
The screen and the ornamental woodwork of pulpit, font lid and choir stalls they chopped up for firewood.
All this they did to please God, who had since the foundation of the Christian Church, been plagued by the gaudy contrivances of man.’
In the 1930s, at the age of eighteen, David Thomson went to tutor the children of an Irish ‘Great House’, Woodbrook, on the road between Carrick-on-Shannon and Boyle, in County Leitrim.
All those lands have water, either acknowledged as lakes, or in winter pools throughout the poor, snipe-grass farmland; how lovely the light must have been to his eyes.
Down the road from Woodbrook lay a little affinity.
In Kilronan churchyard lies the blind harper who, it is said, wrote the music for the tune that became ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’— Turlough O'Carolan, led across Ireland on a white horse by his servant, and sleeping with his harp in the bed so as not to let the instrument's wood warp in damp rooms.
In Leitrim, David Thomson began twin love affairs that took his life along a particular direction — with Phoebe Kirkwood, his young charge; and with Ireland, later the focus of many of his  broadcasts.
He arrived when the life of the Anglican gentry such as the Kirkwoods was changing forever, as the newly independent nation called in all its old slights and insults, and willingly saw off ‘the Protestants’.
In a miniature echo of Tsarist Russia, those of the Ascendancy who were dwindling, Goldsmith's children, and Swift's, were permitted to carry on fading; those more vigorous were not made to feel welcome in the new Ireland of ‘the Risen People’.
Secondly, at the time when the flight from the land became a cultural European fact, a time evoked in rural England by Laurie Lee in Cider with Rosie, David Thomson witnessed the same poignant development in Ireland, but with undertones of old scores and the curious mixture of religion and politics that has taken so long to biodegrade.
The Kirkwoods had to sell their horses, had to endure the slow oncoming tread of gentility in all its shabbiness, to watch the encroaching, ever-drawing-near of the Irish natives who had long been in the tenure and service of the Great House, and now never would be again.
It matters not that these natives were the people who had the original rights, and Thomson's own humanity would never let his reader forget that fact; all he lamented, as he always did, was the passing of an old way, especially when the future replacing it felt less sound.
The book he gleaned from all of this, Woodbrook, his masterpiece, draws a beautiful parallel between personal destiny and ineluctable social forces.
As David watches events that can never take place again, such as the Woodbrook dance, and observes the cloaked distress of the family at their growing impecuniousness, he falls deeper and deeper in love with Phoebe, his Venus rising up through adolescence into womanhood.
All ends in tragedy: David's tragedy, the Kirkwoods' tragedy, above all Phoebe's, and by implication, tragic loss of all the old Irish ways.
Nairn, as a holiday resort, has the name ‘the Rye of the North’, and along the shore and near the golf clubs — one of them built on that land donated by David Thomson's great-uncle — people park caravans hoping for mildness from the Moray Firth.
The ‘small hard town’ as Thomson called it, whatever his loving reminiscences of its Fishertown or nearby magic streams, has, alas, no  Johnsonian or Boswellian relevance, and therefore no reason — this time anyway — to linger.
They did visit Cawdor Castle, which lies about six miles south-south-west of Nairn, reached by the B9090 and linking with the B9191 to the village of Cawdor.
Unexpectedly peaceful gardens with Delphinium called Johnson's Blue , some mauve-white and cobalt Campanula ; peonies; poppies; trefoils in brilliant mauve; scents of lavender and musk rose; four phallic cypress bushes, two of acid-green-yellow, two of dark green; on the tower, eyeless turrets each with a little pennanted wind-vane, the wind is from the west and the flag flies, brilliant yellow predominating, a ship with sails filled, a cross in black and red, and an antlered deer's head; in the bright, southern lee of the castle's core, long buildings roofed with tiny slates, stepped corners; the comfort of a loosely-enclosed, highly aromatic rose-garden; a peony walk, a wall of Euphorbia; in the reaches of the garden, oasal recesses, stone steps leading up to stone seats; a bee visited along thick heavy honeysuckle; rectangular stone troughs, abundant and velvet with flowering plants; old walls placid with centuries of absorbed heat from the sun; a holly tree: did Cawdor once contain all the seven sacred trees from the Celtic grove?
Somewhere, they told me in Nairn, is a hawthorn tree carbon-dated 1372 which I must find, because Boswell mentions it; the ‘hawthorn-tree, which rises like a wooden pillar through the rooms of the castle; for, by a strange conceit, the walls have been built around it’.
I count again the different growths: Hosta, Ehryngum, Thalictrum, giddy lupin, Astilbe, goldenrod.
‘The draw-bridge is still to be seen,’ wrote Johnson, ‘but the moat is now dry.
The tower is very ancient: its walls are of great thickness, arched on the top with stone, and surrounded with battlements.’
Sir Dracula Irving, Bram Stoker's boss, copied the entrance façade for a production of Macbeth.
The Thane of Cawdor's family name is Campbell, and they own other estates in south Wales, at Bosherston, where ponds with a curiously cool water temperature from the underground springs, breed lovely expanses of water lilies.
Boswell failed to have them meet the Earl: presumably the ‘prosperous gentleman’ was examining his  water-lilies in Wales when they called.
Nevertheless, Boswell enlightened his readers regarding ‘The thickness of the walls, the small slaunting windows, and a great iron door at the entrance to the second story as you ascend the stairs, all indicate the rude times in which this castle was erected.’
A sage advised a northern Thane to load his donkey with gold; the castle of Cawdor should be built where the animal stopped from fatigue — by a hawthorn-tree, as it happened: hence its preservation.
Sleekness, an attention to detail, and obvious continuing care have made Cawdor a model property.
This, regrettably, is not the castle where Lady Macbeth did her sleepwalking.
Shakespeare gave the play five castles: Forres; Inverness in which the assassination of Duncan ‘were done quickly’ with the dagger Macbeth saw before him; Macduff's castle in fife; the King's palace in England, and Dunsinane where —‘Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper: Out, out damned spot! out, I say!’
In Forres that morning, Johnson and Boswell argued about evil.
Johnson: Moral evil is occasioned by free will, which implies choice between good and evil.
With all the evil there is, there is no man but would rather be a free agent, than a mere machine without the evil; and what is best for each individual, must be best for the whole.
If a man would rather be the machine, I cannot argue with him.
He is a different being from me.
Boswell argues back that ‘A man, as a machine, may have agreeable sensations; for instance he may have pleasure in music.’
With the usual kindly swat, and again directing his intellectual energy towards moral concerns, Johnson replies, ‘No sir, he cannot have pleasure in music, at least no power of producing music; for he who can produce music may let it alone; he who can play upon a fiddle may break it: such a man is not a machine.’
At the end of the avenue, the village of Cawdor looks as kempt as a pinafore.
Johnson and Boswell, who both called the village ‘Calder’, stayed at the manse, now burnt down.
Their host, the Rev Kenneth MacAulay, great-uncle of Thomas Babington of that name, had sent a letter explaining that he could not meet them in Nairn: his priestly duties detained him in Cawdor — to which Boswell adds a footnote.
When they arrived at the manse, between  twelve and one o'clock on the Saturday, the Reverend, according to Mrs MacAulay, had gone to the church distributing tokens —; ‘little pieces of tin, stamped with the name of the parish’.
Each token, a seal of approval awarded by the minister to those of whom he approved morally that week, had to be handed up on Sunday; those without tokens could not receive the sacrament.
Boswell adds a tantalising footnote: ‘This is a species of priestly power, and sometimes may be abused.
I remember a lawsuit brought by a person against his parish minister, for refusing him…’
Facts, Boswell!
What case?
The name, the name!
Give us dates!
Places!
Boswell had two fears for the sociability of their stay at Cawdor: that his eminent companion might quarrel with their host who had revealed a penchant for speaking ‘slightingly of the lower English clergy’, and that ‘a whole evening at Calder-manse might be heavy’.
Neither materialised.
A neighbouring minister joined them, a Mr Grant (his grandson, Captain James Grant, accompanied John Hanning Speke to trace the source of the Nile): ‘intelligent and well-bred’ sniffs Boswell of Reverend Grant.
They talked of hereditary occupations in the Highlands; the rigour of church rules and creeds; they looked at Latin books, and tiptoed around a delicate matter — whether Johnson the Anglican might wish to hear Mr MacAulay say their Presbyterian prayers in the household, which Boswell doubted.
The Reverend offered to forgo the proceedings, and Boswell advised Johnson of the ‘over-delicate scrupulosity of our host’.
Johnson tushed, and so the other clergyman, Mr Grant (being well-bred), said the prayers, evoking a comment from their distinguished visitor who upbraided him just a little for not including the Lord's Prayer.
The stay of Johnson and Boswell at Cawdor manse captures Johnson in a neat capsule.
We see his professional disdain: before he arrived he spoke disparagingly of his impending host, doubting that Mr MacAulay had himself authored the history of the island of St Kilda, which bore his name.
Johnson's superiority complex goes on show: while there, he used the power of his frown and his supervening wit to silence MacAulay's disregard for the English clergy: ‘This is a day of novelties: I have seen old trees in Scotland, and I have heard the English clergy treated with disrespect.’
Intellectual snobbery: he dismissed the bookshelves of the manse upstairs as ‘rather a lady's library, with some Latin books in it by chance’.
A liberal spirit: he listened courteously and placidly to Presbyterian prayers.
And, a definition of the excellent guest, one who keeps promises given during the hospitality: as well as giving the lad his own Sallust, Johnson promised to create the introductions by which young MacAulay could enter university, and he kept his word, although the boy eventually chose not to avail himself of it.
They stayed at Cawdor from Friday lunchtime to Saturday late morning.
The village can have changed little, although many of the houses feel Edwardian rather than Georgian, and the new manse is Victorian.
On Friday night, the factor of the estate, drinking tea with them, wrote a letter of introduction to nearby fort George.
Their detour to Fort George crossed what is how the main road from Nairn to Inverness, and they arrived some time in the late morning.
A gossipy exchange developed between Boswell and a Major Brewse, or Bruce, of the Engineers, regarding the Major's surname.
At this point, ‘Dr Johnson observed that there had been great disputes about the spelling of Shakespear's [sic]name: ‘At last it was thought it would be settled by looking at the original copy of his will; but, upon examining it, he was found to have written it himself no less than three different ways.’
Touring the fort, commanded by Sir Eyre Coote of the 37th Regiment, an unexpected knowledge surfaced: ‘Dr Johnson talked of the proportions of charcoal and salt-petre in making gunpowder, of granulating it and of giving it a gloss’— although he admitted to Boswell afterwards that he had ‘talked ostentatiously’.
Boswell enjoyed the martial ambience of the fort: ‘At three the drum beat for dinner.
I, for a little while, fancied myself a military  man, and it pleased me.’
If the flavour of his text so far is to be believed, Bozzy was as much a soldiering man as Coleridge, which is saying less than very little.
At dinner a military band played; the governor's wife was ‘a very agreeable woman, with an uncommonly mild and sweet tone of voice’, and the governor told Johnson and Boswell that ‘the Arabs could live for five days without victuals, and subsist for three weeks on nothing else but the blood of their camels, who could lose so much of it as would suffice for that time, without being exhausted.’
Discussion moved to matters of the stage, to comparisons of great performers, to criticism of Garrick's pronunciation of certain words in Hamlet, and the qualities of Mrs Cibber's expression.
The conversation, the ‘dinner of two complete courses, variety of wines and the regimental band of musick playing in the square’ all enchanted Boswell, and according to him, Johnson too, whom he reports as saying, ‘I shall always remember this fort with gratitude.’
Johnson, however, devotes one mere paragraph to a description — or rather a non-description — of their visit.
‘Of Fort George I shall not attempt to give any account.
I cannot delineate it scientifically, and a loose and popular description is of use only when the imagination is to be amused.
There was every where an appearance of the utmost neatness and regularity.
But my suffrage is of little value, because this and Fort Augustus are the only garrisons that I ever saw.’
By visiting Fort George, and by going straight from there to Inverness — they said goodbye to the officers between six and seven o'clock — Johnson and Boswell made a revealing choice.
They elected to bypass Drummossie Moor, site of the battle of Culloden in 1746, twenty-seven years earlier.
Neither mentions the battlefield.
It seems impossible that they could not have known where they were; they can only have ignored it deliberately, and therefore perhaps for political reasons of their own.
Boswell needed the good opinion of the Establishment as a lizard needs the heat of the sun.
Johnson was receiving a pension from the King whose brother was the Duke of Cumberland, the butcher of the day.
Yet Boswell and other Johnsonians report that, long  before the pension, Johnson wondered aloud if holding up his right hand would have secured victory for the Stuarts at Culloden to Prince Charles's army, he was not sure he would have held it up; so little confidence had he in the right claimed by the house of Stuart, and so fearful was he of the consequences of another revolution on the throne of Great Britain'.
Had Johnson walked Drummossie he would have had to contemplate the events there, and the long reverberations of 1746, and the gloatings and celebrations that took place annually in Inverness long afterwards, and since he was chronically and constitutionally unable not to give an opinion, whatever he said would have landed him in difficulty with somebody.
Again, I hear the smack of collusion between Johnson and Boswell in their separate accounts of their Highland jaunt.
It may simply be the case that Boswell, seeing that Johnson chose not to mention Culloden, took the same course of action.
After all, Boswell's Life of Johnson derives from what Johnson said: but do we know what proportion Boswell reported of what Johnson said?
And I cannot believe that the two did not exchange at length here, passing the very threshold of such a dominant historic occasion, an event which still burnt into the consciousness of all Scots at the time.
In Sir Walter Scott's time — and he was, after all, born twenty-five years after Culloden — Scotland still uttered the name Cumberland ‘with an infant hatred’.
Johnson was in his thirties in 1745, and well aware that the Duke of Cumberland mustered his armies on Clapham Common, while London waited and wondered whether the Stuart Pretender would truly drive on south and attack the capital.
A year later, in that one heart-wrenching day at Culloden, Scotland capitulated.
Yet many subjects throughout the whole island of Britain retained an affection — partly romantic — for the Stuarts.
Johnson's writings and conversations indicate a highly politicised man, and nobody, unless an apolitical hermit, could have been uninterested in, unaware of, the Stuart Rebellion of 1745 — 6, and the Cause behind it.
Furthermore, Boswell reports Johnson's clear sympathy with Jacobitism.
In the Life, he makes a number of references — to Johnson's high regard for a man he knew to be in hiding in London  on account of having borne arms in the ‘45; to the curious fact that Johnson wrote almost not at all during the year 1745 — though Boswell, a windblown reed at best where politics were concerned, attributes this to preparation for the great Dictionary, rather than to any politically-induced melancholia.
He also refers to Johnson's condemnation in 1760 of the fashion for defaming and decrying the House of Stuart; and he reports a violent argument between Johnson and a Whig called Taylor, during which Johnson not only insisted that the Stuarts owned the true right to the throne of England, but that people disliked the Hanoverians (as Johnson himself did) and were so disaffected by them that they had generally lost interest in the monarchy altogether.
Again, observing the conversation of a rainy night in July 1763, Boswell wrote of Johnson's perceivable affections, ‘He no doubt had an early attachment to the House of Stuart; but his zeal has cooled as his reason strengthened…
Yet there is no doubt that at earlier periods he was wont often to exercise both his pleasantry and ingenuity in talking Jacobitism.’
This was the same evening on which Johnson wryly said that now the Hanoverian King had given him a pension, he could hardly drink Stuart health with the wine thus bought.
‘I think that the pleasures of cursing the House of Hanover, and drinking King James's health, are amply over-balanced by three hundred pounds a year.’
Incontrovertibly, therefore, Johnson had embraced Jacobitism to some degree of sympathy at some stage, and perhaps even quite vehemently, and perhaps for quite a long period of his life — but, as with the formation of many political tastes and stances, the dalliance owed as much to what he disliked (the Hanoverian kings) as to what he espoused and idealised.
A traditionalist, he was guided by the natural right of succession and in his view, ‘the house of Stuart succeeded to the full right of both the houses of York and Lancaster, whose common source is the undisputed right.’
So how can it be that Johnson and Boswell passed this woeful and apocalyptic place, faces averted?
Although the story has been long and widely recounted (John Prebble's heartbreaking book, Culloden, brings the event to life), nothing compares with walking the field, seeing the small cairns  marking where clansmen fell, measuring the rides of the horse-troops.
Wednesday morning, 16 April 1746, rained, it was chilly, and the citizens of Inverness came out from the town to view this spectator sport.
The armies saw each other for the first time at just after eleven o'clock.
Another heavy shower swept across the marshy ground.
The English with their Scottish support had breakfasted well; the Highlanders had left their supplies at Nairn, and were cold and unfed.
They had no chance — perhaps they had no chance from the beginning.
Right cause, wrong leader: Prince Charles has come to be viewed as a drunken, disorganised fop.
Departing Brest on a French frigate on 16 July 1745 he landed on the island of Eriskay saying, ‘I am come home.’
Alexander MacDondald of Boisdale, the Highland chief who met him on arrival, begged him to go back to Europe.
Bonnie Prince Charlie refused, and many of the clans rallied to his support; others ratted and joined the King's forces.
Although the romance has powered many a writer, notably Stevenson, some latter-day Scots take the harder, colder view of the pretender — such as the novelist and poet Iain Crichton-Smith, who, in his novel The Dream, has one of his characters muse, ‘He was an evil ghost who had drifted into the Highlands, like some kind of vaporous poison, with his powdered hair and his boyish rapacity for adventure, intoxicated by the new air, the mountains, the lochs, the heather, and by his selfish opportunism he had brought tragedy on the Highlands.
And later he was cruel, a wife-beating drunkard, after he had destroyed the Highlands in a storm of hailstones and fire.’
Bonnie Prince Charlie was also a Catholic, another of the facts for which he was never forgiven and another contribution to the ambivalence he excites.
Charles and Cumberland were as ill-matched personally —; the unrealistic poseur versus the eighteen-stone professional soldier — as they were ill-matched militarily.
The Duke had powerful artillery and trained soldiers; the Prince had lesser firepower and undisciplined goodwill.
prebble quotes the Chevalier de Johnstone who fought with the Glengarrys: ‘What a spectacle of horror!
The same Highlanders who had advanced to the charge like lions, with bold and determined countenance, were in an instant seen flying like trembling cowards in the greatest disorder.’
Such blood, and the mud of Culloden, were the last Gaelic colours to fly over Scotland; the clans looked straight into the mouths of Cumberland's cannon and died, and with them expired a way of life — the Stewarts of Appin, and the Maclarens, and the Camerons, and the Atholl Brigade, and behind them Ogilvies, and behind them the prince himself.
The wind was blowing hard at the Highlanders' faces, according to the literature given out at the Culloden Visitors' Centre, and the two armies were in position at one o'clock, approximately four to five hundred yards apart.
‘The battle was over in less than an hour,’ says the leaflet, and eventually the Prince's message went out, ‘Let every man find his own way to safety the best way he can.’
Two days later seventeen Highland officers, held prisoner at Culloden House (where the Prince slept the night before the battle), were murdered: Cumberland lost five hundred men: the Jacobites two and a half times as many.
It is a wide field, and a road crosses part of it; there is no shelter here and the ground is still soft, especially in the winter.
In the summer, even when the sun is shining, it can still be cold, whether from the weather or the ghosts of the dead.
Paraphrasing Tacitus and Byron, the Visitors' Centre has the last word on Bloody Cumberland: ‘he created a desert and called it peace.’
All tragedies have cruel footnotes.
An unreliable horseman on the Stuart side, witnessing the first charge of the clans on the Cumberland army, believed no troop could withstand such an onslaught, and he rode south to Edinburgh declaring victory, causing the Jacobites of the city to dance and sing.
Their position was reversed when the truth circulated; they went into hiding — as did Scots and Catholics in London: not only did the King's supporters crow and celebrate, they also took revenge.
Inverness, a likeable city, is visible from a distance.
In this town of bridges, Johnson stayed at Mackenzie's Inn, now a supermarket, and on Sunday morning went to the English chapel, long since gone: it was a coarse little place anyway, and Mr Tait preached a sermon on Love Your Enemies.
Boswell felt depressed for a brief time, and homesick: no letters had arrived for him, the cause of a little worry.
In Inverness, Johnson held forth on the  benefits Scotland had derived from the Union, and after church they saw the Quay and Macbeth's Castle, and had lunch with Mr Keith, the excise collector, whose wife quizzed Johnson about his ‘drinking water’.
Johnson volunteered some information about the size of the excise duty his friend Thrale the brewer in Streatham had paid the previous year and, says Boswell, ‘after this there was little conversation that deserves to be remembered.’
One interesting nugget gleams on this page of Boswell's Journal of a Tour.
When he and Johnson got back to their inn, Boswell ‘begged permission to leave him for a little while, that I might run about and pay some short visits to several good people of Inverness’.
Boswell does not divulge any names or addresses: was he in search of sport among the streetwalkers of the north?
If he had bumped into anyone worthy of half a mention he would have told us.
Johnson said to him, ‘You have all the old-fashioned principles, good and bad.’
That night, Sunday, Mr Grant, the well-bred reverend gentleman they met at Cawdor manse, joined them, and Mr Keith the excise man, and they ate roasted kid ‘which Dr Johnson had never tasted before.
He relished it much.’
Maybe they should have collaborated on a book, instead of writing separate accounts.
In Johnson's company, you leave Inverness with a full impression of its contemporary military, social and commercial importance.
He asserted that the good people of Inverness owed all they had to the previous conquest and occupation by Cromwell.
‘Yet what the Romans did to other nations, was in a great degree done by Cromwell to the Scots: he civilized them by conquest, and introduced by useful violence the arts of peace.’
Interesting euphemism: ‘useful violence’— leading perhaps to the creation of terms such as‘constructive murder’ or ‘helpful massacre’?
Johnson had travelled hopefully and was about to arrive: the following day he would leave the comparative comfort he had hitherto enjoyed, and head into the wilds, and not in a coach but on horseback.
He wondered, in his Inverness passage, whether it was ‘peculiar to the Scots to have attained the liberal, without the manual arts, to have excelled in ornamental knowledge, and to have wanted not only the elegancies, but the conveniences of common life’.
He goes on to make the point that the Scots  possessed advanced tastes and understanding in literature, with a Latin poetry that ‘would have done honour to any nation’, but then ponders aloud — no wonder he offended them so — why ‘men thus ingenious and inquisitive were content to live in total ignorance of the trades by which human wants are supplied, and to supply them by the grossest means.
Till the Union made them acquainted with English manners, the culture of their lands was unskilful, and their domestic life unformed; their tables were coarse as the feasts of Eskimeaux, and their houses as filthy as the cottages of Hottentots.’
Thus did, and do, travellers in other countries offer huge insult.
He continued even more offensively: ‘Since they have known that their condition was capable of improvement, their progress in useful knowledge has been rapid and uniform…
But they must be for ever content to owe to the English that elegance and culture, which, if they had been vigilant and active, perhaps the English might have owed to them.’
In his account of their two-night stopover at Inverness, Boswell left out of his Journal of a Tour one enchanting detail.
An incident at dinner on Sunday night became part of the Reverend Mr Grant's conversational furniture, a story he told for many years later.
Johnson, it seems, began to regale the table concerning some extraordinary creature recently discovered in New South Wales, and began to imitate the animal, the kangaroo.
Suddenly, he stood upright, held out his hands like paws, then bunched up the tails of his huge brown coat in front of his stomach to convey an impression of the kangaroo's pouch, and began to bounce about the room.
What a pity the kangaroo had been discovered too late for Johnson s Dictionary: Captain Cook makes the first reference to it three years earlier, in his Journal for August 1770.
I like to think Johnson would have gloried in the most likeable derivation of the word ‘kangaroo’, even if lacking evidence for its provenance.
The philological folklore claims that the animal was named when an English explorer (Cook himself?) asked an Aboriginal, ‘What in Heaven's name is that?’ as the exotic animal bounced across his view.
To which he allegedly received the reply, ‘Kangaroo’—; native tongue for ‘I don't understand what you are saying.’
When they left Mackenzie's Inn at Inverness early on Monday, 30 August, two Highland guides ran along ahead of them, John Hay and Laughland Vass; Johnson told Mrs Thrale they were ‘active, officious, civil and hardy’.
Other than a girl he had seen at a spinning-wheel and singing a song in the Gaelic at Nairn, this was Johnson's first true contact with the Scots of the west.
The timbre of his text begins to alter just east of Inverness: his explorations were about to begin.
On their right, Loch Ness beamed at them: a glorious day.
Johnson reported the lake water, so often gunmetal and brooding, as remarkably clear and pleasant, and is imagined by the natives to be medicinal'.
This, in itself, ought to quieten speculation about a Loch Ness monster; the water's reputation for healing clearly belongs to ancient traditions, and when a place so powerfully atmospheric generates one legend, it is surely capable of throwing up several more.
When he gets to Iona, Johnson will walk for the second time in footsteps he does not yet know about, those of the man who caused the folklore — Columba was here.
In 565 he came down from the islands to try and convert a Pictish king.
On the way, he met a distressed group of Picts: one of their number had just been eaten alive by a monster in the lake.
Columba sent one of his companions into the water, and just as the creature opened its jaws for its second course, Columba with a wave of his hand banished it: Nessie, all humps and coils, fled whining.
Boswell says, ‘The scene was as sequestered and agreeably wild as could be desired, and for a time engrossed all our attention.’
Johnson's ‘low trees’— or their grandchildren — are now grown to great green heights.
They ignored a Druid's temple — Johnson said, ‘one is quite enough’— and then came to ‘a little hut, with an old looking woman at the door of it.
I thought, here might be a scene that would amuse Dr Johnson; so I mentioned it to him.
‘Let's go in,’ said he.’
Johnson devotes a long paragraph to the old woman's but as Dr Livingstone might have described an African kraal.
His word-picture also describes the typical Bronze- and Iron-Age European small dwelling developed from the wooden buildings of the Hallstatt and La Tène periods, from 700 B.C.: ‘The wall, which is commonly about six feet high, declines from the perpendicular  a little inward.
Such rafters as can be procured are then raised for a roof, and covered with heath, which makes a strong and warm thatch…
No light is admitted but at the entrance, and through a hole in the thatch, which gives vent to the smoke.
This hole is not directly over the fire, lest the rain should extinguish it; and the smoke therefore naturally fills the place before it escapes.’
The woman was boiling a goat, one of her herd of sixty, when the riding party arrived; the two Highland guides interpreted her Gaelic.
She had an interesting marital structure.
Johnson calls her an ‘old woman’, and true, her husband was eighty years old.
But the eldest of her five children was thirteen — therefore Boswell's observation of ‘an old looking woman’ had a truer ring.
She invited them to be seated and offered them a drink.
Their reports of this encounter highlight the difference between Johnson and Boswell as human beings.
Johnson's account acknowledges the woman's pastoral existence, and he dignifies her with a detailed report, pointing out that her circumstances were by no means on the lowest and most impoverished social scale.
He does his readers the service of conveying to them the life and living of a family they might never encounter, or have had occasion to consider.
Boswell struggles, sometimes unsuccessfully, against an instinct to disparage.
He calls the hut ‘a wretched litle hovel of earth’, and makes comparisons only on a social scale, as distinct from Johnson's genuine anthropology.
He even manages a lewdness.
‘Dr Johnson was curious to know where she slept…
She answered with a tone of emotion, saying she was afraid we wanted to go to bed with her.
This coquetry, or whatever it may be called, of so wretched a being, was truly ludicrous.’
Johnson and Boswell later bantered on the matter, each playfully accusing the other of being the one the woman feared —‘the wicked young fellow, the wild dog’ or the ‘terrible ruffian’fortunately accompanied by ‘a civil decent young man’.
As he so often does, Boswell missed the point — or two.
How natural for a woman sensible of her humble circumstances not to wish to unveil the total intimacy of her house to passing strangers.
Secondly, he ignored folk memory of the English and the noble Scottish and their depredations: à propos, a story came to light  much later, and recurs in local annals and in the works of many Johnsonian students
In 1746, one of Cumberland's officers on his way back from victory at Culloden had invaded the very same hut and raped a girl (his troopers held her down) then strangled the grandmother to command her silence.
The ‘old looking’ woman whom Boswell and Johnson met took over that house the following year, by which time the crime had been punished.
Even though the story reverberated through the Highlands, there is no evidence that either Boswell or Johnson knew the tale — had they done so, Boswell might have been less merry with his lubricious reasons as to why the woman would not show them the bedroom.
Indeed, Boswell's insensitivity went further.
Against the woman's express wishes, he lit a piece of paper and went into her bedroom anyway, and reported a ‘bedstead of wood with heath [heather]upon it by way of a bed; at the foot of which I saw some sort of blankets of covering rolled in a heap’.
Johnson did not drink her proffered dram, but Boswell and the two guides did, and when she asked them for snuff, her great luxury, they had none, but gave her money instead.
Boswell's rendering of the Loch Ness day skips ahead to lunch in a pub then their overnight stay with the deputy Governor of Fort Augustus.
Johnson's account pauses at the Fall of Fiers, today called Foyers, a little more than halfway down the south-eastern length of the Loch.
Opposite a café and shop, a tall, sparse wood leads down to a dramatic view of the Falls, a cataract powerful enough to feed a local hydro-electricity station.
Johnson observes that ‘the country at the bridge strikes the imagination with all the gloom and grandeur of Siberian solitude.’
Not today; two pathways, both of soft going, lead to the Falls — the right-hand one for a good, distant view, the left-hand, less comfortable and over risky stones, for a close-up.
Johnson took this latter and soon ‘began to wish that our curiosity might have been gratified with less trouble and danger’.
All he saw was the ghost of the waterfall: ‘we visited the place at an unseasonable time, and found it divested of its dignity and terror.’
I cannot say whether they travelled on this good modern road.
More likely, they followed a route now reduced: like Kipling's road through the woods, ‘weather and rain have undone it again and now we shall never know there was once a road through the woods.’
Full of sky, the landscape gleams with distant water.
This road swoops.
Past little stands of foxglove in the green foreground before a copse, the floor of the wood swerves sharply down to a fast stream the colour of nickel.
The party lunched on mutton, bacon and eggs, with rum, whisky and wine — Johnson again drank water — in a house called The General's Hut, named for that good strong Irishman, George Wade, to whom the Highlands owe their road system.
General Wade built forty bridges up here inside a decade: and he carried the metaphor of his construction over into his administration —; under his command, military rule in the wake of an insurrection proved less brutal, more instinctively communal, than the savagery of the butcher Cumberland who followed him.
At dark they arrived in Fort Augustus.
They had made the length of Loch Ness in one day, not bad going for an old man on horseback; ‘when he rode,’ says Boswell at the end of the Life, ‘he had no command or direction of his horse, but was carried as if in a balloon.’
Even if they followed an older, slightly more direct road, it still amounted to a total of about thirty-three miles.
Any Johnsonian interest Fort Augustus once had has disappeared: the travellers tried an inn here, found it ‘wretched’ and stayed with the deputy governor at the fort, a gentleman of French extraction named Trapaud.
A monastery occupies the foundations today, the military buildings having been largely pulled down long ago.
At breakfast, having walked the governor's garden, they talked to a couple of officers who had fought the Indians in America, making Johnson wish he lived there so that he could write a book about them.
In their separate entries for Fort Augustus, it is the fleeting observation that once again gives such valuable illumination.
Johnson displays almost no preoccupation with the place, which he summarises as ‘much less than that of St George…
It was not long ago taken by the Highlanders.’
Not the building Johnson stayed in: he slept in a new fort built to replace the one  destroyed by the Jacobites.
‘But its situation,’ continues Johnson, ‘seems well chosen for pleasure, if not for strength’; and then in half a sentence he gives us a glimpse of local life and activity: ‘It stands at the head of the lake and, by a sloop of sixty tuns, is supplied from Inverness with great convenience’— which description immediately conjures the vessel plying up and down Loch Ness with provisions, armaments, soldiers' wives.
Fort Augustus offers two things worth relishing: that its canal provides a waterway down to Loch Oich and Loch Lochy and into Loch Linnhe and therefore out to sea and to Mull and Manhattan and Newfoundland.
Secondly, it conjures the Wild West by virtue of its position as the middle of a line of three forts, Fort William to the south, and Fort George to the north.
They resisted Mr Trapaud's invitation to lunch.
According to Boswell, ‘Between twelve and one we set out, and travelled eleven miles, through a wild country, till we came to a house in Glenmorison [the modern spelling adds a ‘t’— Glenmoriston: Johnson calls it Glenmollison]called Anoch, kept by a McQueen.’
To hit this road they had to go north a little from Fort Augustus and then swing to the west.
Just beyond Fort Augustus a trace of their road may still be found; now impassable, it must have been a fearful route: the climb up to any height of it is ferociously demanding — or else I hit it at the wrong spot.
Johnson comments, ‘To make this way, the rock has been hewn to a level with labour that might have broken the perseverance of a Roman legion.’
Therefore, unless hiking with considerable fortitude, the only way to approximate their journey is to take the normal road up as far as Invermoriston and then continue on its south-western fork, the A887, and in time it becomes the road — or so I presume —; Johnson and Boswell travelled, the one cut by General Wade, straight across the rising land and emerging a little over half-way along the present road through Glenmoriston.
They then followed a path in the lee of the mountains to Loch Cluanie (near which the upper and lower roads converge) and thence Glen Shiel.
Other than the hope of eagles, there is nothing in these tense high glens, north or south of Fort Augustus, to detain the traveller.
Johnson says he saw no animals.
I saw a bird of prey, a hen harrier, as intent as an osprey, beating her wings at early evening against  a stand of firs, hunting like a cruise missile along the edge of a windbreak.
Where Johnson found a country totally denuded of its wood' — how he loved the confirmation of his prejudices —; forestry now swathes the unpromising terrain.
In one of those asides, Johnson with the eye of a painter gives the last glimpse of these high ways in 1773: ‘Once we saw a corn field, in which a lady was walking with some gentlemen…’
Both writers make light of this crossing from Fort Augustus to the middle of Glenmoriston, even though it must have proven their most arduous stage so far — eleven miles of high, hard going, ‘cut in traverses’ as Johnson says, ‘so that as we went upon a higher stage, we saw the baggage following us below in a contrary direction.’
They came to Anoch in the early afternoon, having to break their journey early, because the opportunities for food and lodging were not evenly distributed between Fort Augustus and Glenelg: Johnson says, ‘the only house, where we could be entertained, was not further off than a third of the way’.
That night, they had plenty of opportunity for conversation, and here they had one of their most memorable encounters.
McQueen, a genuine Highlander, kept the inn (such as it was) at Anoch and he brought Johnson the closest he had yet been to the controversies of the recent Stuart cause.
This cultivated man, McQueen, had fought at Culloden.
He spoke accentless English with excellent grammar, proved civil and hospitable and well-read: in his stone-and-wattle premises he possessed a volume of The Spectator, a volume of Humphrey Prideaux's The Old and New Testament Connected in the History of the Jews, and, judging from Boswell, the man reflected annoyance when Johnson expressed surprise at finding books in his house.
Johnson dwells on McQueen's diction, complimenting him upon it and being told in return that the man had ‘learned it by grammar’, and Johnson goes on to contemplate that such good English must have been acquired while such people served in the armed forces.
Evidently it did not occur to him that it could also have been a case of the mastery of English becoming a kind of weapon in the mouths of the dispossessed.
The pair stayed overnight at Anoch, where the McQueens possessed some small acres of turnips and potatoes, a fact which, as  with so much of such crofting, mystifies; these fields, very little flesh of earth on the bones of rock, seem only capable of mosses and heathers.
On that afternoon of Tuesday, 31 August, McQueen's daughter served them tea; she wore a print linen dress, and had been to Inverness for a year's education in reading, writing, sewing, knotting, lace- and pastry-making.
(A decade later, Johnson, on a journey to Oxford, sat in the stage-coach beside a Mrs Beresford and her daughter; the girl was passing the time in knotting, a kind of tatting, in which coloured threads are knitted into decorative knots.
Miss Beresford, in a hero-worshipping whisper to Boswell, said of Johnson, ‘How he does talk!
Every sentence is an essay!’
Johnson, who was looking askance at Miss Beresford's occupational therapy, said, ‘In the scale of insignificance, I think knotting is to be reckoned next to mere idleness —; though I once attempted to learn knotting…but I made no progress.’)
Neither Boswell nor Johnson states Miss McQueen's precise age, but she seems to have passed sufficiently beyond pubescent embarrassment to converse relaxedly with the great Englishman, and Johnson made her a gift of a book, an act of generosity which later caused not a little controversy.
Many of Johnson's readers wished to know what kind of reading Dr Johnson thought suitable for young ladies, and it transpired, to much amusement, that he had given young Miss McQueen an arithmetic.
The laughter which this caused proved irritating to Johnson, but usefully stimulated a response which gives a good insight.
He resented the implied criticism, and defended himself by saying he merely gave her a book which he happened to have with him, rather than one he felt suitable for such a person.
It was not a book that he had packed when leaving London: he had bought it a day or two earlier in Inverness, and to Boswell, years later, he gave, not unmemorably, his reasons for buying it at all: ‘Why, Sir, if you are to have but one book with you upon a journey, let it be a book of science.
When you have read through a book of entertainment, you know it, and it can do no more for you; but a book of science is inexhaustible.’
We have no record of whether Miss McQueen —‘not inelegant in either mien or dress’, as Johnson found her: Boswell calls her ‘a modest, civil girl, very neatly  dressed’— found Cocker's Arithmetick equally absorbing.
Johnson hoped that his gift would ensure she did not forget him.
Within the inn at Anoch, walled with thick turves of earth, wainscotted with wicker, and by its chimney distinguished from the other two huts nearby, the landlord and his daughter — no mention of a Mrs McQueen — served them a meal of eggs, chicken, sausage and mutton, with rum.
Mr McQueen joined them at table, and gave Johnson the kind of local knowledge he loved — the economics, way of life, problems of such an existence.
Already, seventy men had emigrated from the glen to America, and McQueen intended to follow them within the year.
All the difficulty sprang from high rents; for his own farm, the landlord now paid four times more than he had twenty years ago, and he found this unfair: he would have been happy to go from five pounds a year to ten, but not to twenty.
Johnson took McQueen's side and observed acidly that it was the Laird who should be forced to emigrate, at which McQueen respectfully and loyally demurred, knowing that the laird, to quote Boswell, ‘could not shift for himself in America’.
A party of soldiers arrived at the inn; the travellers had earlier met them road-building between Fort Augustus and Anoch and in deference to the hospitality they had received from Mr Trapaud, Johnson and Boswell gave the men cash to buy drink — which now they did.
Johnson gave them more money, the not inconsiderable sum of a shilling each, for which generosity they hailed him, addressing him as ‘My Lord’.
The soldiers stayed up all night, brawling their guts out.
The pair of travellers slept in a somewhat makeshift room, where a woman's dress hanging on a rope acted as a partition between two beds.
Mrs Boswell had packed sheets in her husband's luggage, and Joseph Ritter laid them on both beds.
Boswell feared vermin; Johnson anticipated the chill as if stepping into a cold bath, and tied a coloured handkerchief around his head.
In merry companionship both men braved the hardship of the landlord's sleeping  arrangements and settled for the night, chatting idly and humorously across the partition like schoolboys in a dormitory.
Copiousness of detail excepted, a fundamental difference in the  attitude of each traveller again lies deep within and beneath their texts when they write of Anoch and Mr McQueen.
Johnson was warm, Boswell uncertain.
Johnson responded to this courteous, gentlemanly Highlander; Boswell failed to see beyond the Gael, the Jacobite.
After his initial gaffe that McQueen should own books, Johnson opened out to a man of culture, a man who understood his own problems and who had thought a way through them to a solution, however sad emigration might prove.
Boswell, contrarily — and patronisingly — feared danger.
‘Wednesday, 1st September: I awaked very early.
I began to imagine that the landlord, being about to emigrate, might murder us to get our money…’ and claims that Johnson had entertained the same fears, although Johnson never mentions such thoughts.
Neither writer gave McQueen the credit of his own history; neither enquired into, or assessed, the status he might have had before the ‘45 Rebellion, in which he had participated, and by which he had most likely been reduced to keeping this crude but hospitable inn.
It may have been a stopping-place for drovers — but he could still do Dr Johnson the honour of making lemonade from fresh lemons.
And he still practised sufficiently the ways of the Highland families to send his daughter to Inverness for as good an education as a girl could get within reach at that time.
Next stop, the boat to Skye from Glenelg, and after an early breakfast, they left Anoch at eight o'clock.
Mr McQueen walked some miles with them into the mountains.
He gave Johnson his economic statistics, a hundred each of sheep and goats; twelve milch cows; twenty-eight dry beef cattle ready to be sold, ‘awaiting the drover’.
He also cited a local laird's wealth — or lack of it: from a hundred square miles of property, sixty thousand acres, he could raise only four hundred pounds a year, no matter what rent pressure he put on his tenants.
In the final conversation he had with them, McQueen told Boswell and Johnson of his adventures in the 1745 Rebellion, when he had been part of Bonnie Prince Charlie's invasion force of England and got as far as Derbyshire, and fought at Culloden.
Boswell sometimes stinks faintly of hypocrisy.
No doubt can exist of his Anglophilia, yet he now says that when he heard  McQueen tell the story of the ‘45, ‘I could not refrain from tears,’ and qualifies his response by discussing a set of feelings not a million miles from sentimentality; ‘The very Highland names, or the sound of a bagpipe, will stir my blood, and fill me with a mixture of melancholy and respect for courage; with pity for an unfortunate and superstitious regard for antiquity, and thoughtless inclination for war; in short, with a crowd of sensations with which sober rationality has nothing to do.’
Two guides: one very tall servant: Boswell and Johnson on horseback; the quaint party pressed on beneath these lovely forbidding mountains to Glenshiel.
Johnson remained relatively unimpressed, even by a glimpse of snow that had persisted to this, the first day of September.
His eye measured these impressive heights coolly, relating them always to sea level rather than to their own grandeur, and correcting Boswell's exultation over ‘another mountain I called immense: Johnson: ‘No; it is no more than a considerable protuberance.’’
Little by little, however, the force of this long glen beneath the austere greyness of the Five Sisters touched Johnson, and he moved his position from that of first considering the political role of such remoteness, and the opportunities it gave for military strategies and subsequent escapes — Glenshiel had been the scene of a battle fifty-four years earlier in which local Highlanders unsuccessfully reinforced a Spanish invasion force — to being lulled by the sight of so many waters, brooks, burns, and silver rivulets, ‘which commonly ran with a clear shallow stream over a hard pebbly bottom’.
Now that he had arrived at the wildest part of Britain, he wished to use his adventure in the same spirit as that in which Montaigne wrote his famous Essais — as trials of himself, as investigations of the ideas that arose in the non-stop chatter of his mind.
At noon, in a narrowing part of the glen, a stretch which offered a little more greenery than the earlier reaches, the Highland guides, knowing of the climb ahead, halted to feed, water and rest the horses.
Johnson grasped hold of some solitude and became for an hour or so a noble savage and a member of the armies of medieval romance, communing with nature on the bank of a stream: ‘The day was calm, the air soft, and all was rudeness, silence and solitude.
Before  me, and on either side, were high hills, which by hindering the eye from ranging, forced the mind to find entertainment for itself.’
That passage and the two meditative paragraphs which follow, constitute the high point of his adventure in the wilds so far, and the first true narration of the adventures of his mind among remoteness.
When his Journey was published two years later, this quiet moment received great acclaim, hailed by one reviewer as ‘a fortunate event in the annals of literature…we congratulate the public on the event…’
The critic was reacting to Johnson's capacity for inventive response.
Time after time on his Scottish travels he conjured original ideas from his encounters with the unfamiliar.
But when the published version is contrasted with his more mundane conclusions, as in his letters to his friends, an element of performance can be seen in the formal account.
For example, to Mrs Thrale he described the scene of this famed moment of quietude briefly —‘on a green bank, with a small stream running at my feet, in the midst of savage solitude, with Mountains before me, and on either hand covered with heath’— then commented, ‘I looked round me, and wondered that I was not more affected, but the mind is not at all times equally ready to be put in motion.’
However, in his Journey to the Western Islands he takes a much more elaborate position: ‘The imaginations excited by the view of an unknown and untravelled wilderness are not such as arise in the  artificial solitude of parks and gardens, a flattering notion of self-sufficiency, a placid indulgence of voluntary delusions, a secure expansion of the fancy, or a cool concentration of the mental powers.’
He contrasted these with the force of the wild where ‘man is made unwillingly acquainted with his own weakness, and meditation shows him how little he can sustain, and how little he can perform’.
A puzzle solved itself out here.
On several occasions, and in many places, it had surprised me that Johnson made no comment: Strichen, the planned village, in particular, and the Pictish ancestry of Forres.
These and other similar resonances seemed to me hand-fashioned for Johnson's interest — but time and again, no comment.
Now I knew the reason.
When he sat down on his romantic bank by his crystal brook, the thought of turning the journey into  a book was born: ‘Whether I spent the hour well I know not; for here I first conceived the thought of this narration.’
After their rest, they began the last push to the islands, the most difficult part of their journey yet.
At Shiel Bridge, at the head of Loch Duich, the road climbs west up into Ratagan Forest and up through Glen More, emerging out onto a short Jack-and-the-Beanstalk plateau, and then hard and drearily down to Glenelg from whose shore the Isle of Skye across the Sound of Sleat may almost be reached by fingertip.
Although Ratagan was beclouded, the sun shone through behind me, putting a shine on the slate-coloured waters below.
I knew in advance that I would have to retrace my steps on this road, to get to the Skye boat at the Kyle of Lochalsh, as there is nowadays only a summer ferry to the island from Glenelg.
The physical aspect of my journey had collapsed: a heel injury became aggravated, with a cut almost in as far as the bone, and the rest of the tour found me on wheels or afloat more than on foot.
Before Boswell and Johnson began this ascent, which in parts feels almost vertical, they made one more stop — at the hamlet of Auchnasheal or Auknasheals, ‘consisting of many huts’, wrote Johnson, ‘perhaps twenty, built all of dry stone, that is, stones piled up without mortar’.
No trace of Auchnasheal exists, although somewhere beneath the moss the stones must still lurk.
The place gave Johnson another whiff of anthropology: here he stood as if in Africa or Arabia, greeting wild natives in their habitat: these Macraes might have been Xhosa tribesmen, or Tuaregs: ‘The villagers gathered about us in considerable numbers, I believe without any evil intention, but with a very savage wildness of aspect and manner.’
An extra man, says Boswell, had joined their little party, ‘Evan Campbell, servant to Mr Murchison, factor to the Laird of Macleod in Glenelg ran along with us today.
He was a very obliging fellow.’
Evan Campbell, or John Hay, or Laughland Vass, or perhaps all three Highlander guides, knew that milk could be had from the Macraes of Auchnasheal; the travellers sat down outside a house and were brought wooden dishes — Johnson calls them ‘pails’— of milk.
Boswell: ‘One of them was frothed like a  syllabub.
I saw a woman preparing it with such a stick as is used for chocolate, and in the same manner.’
For this largesse the tourists replied in kind, and in the manner of explorers.
They distributed in paper twists small parcels of snuff and tobacco, bought at Fort Augustus for this very purpose at the instigation of Mr Trapaud, and Boswell also gave them their leftover wheaten bread, a substance unknown among the oats and barley eaters of the Highlands.
Next, they offered to pay the woman of the house for the milk, and she asked a shilling, at which some of the men goaded her towards more; when she refused to raise her price, Boswell gave her a half-crown (influenced, I feel, not so much by her honest generosity, but by her shapeliness which he described as ‘comely almost as the figure of Sappho’).
Johnson makes less of his stop among the Macraes than one might have expected.
Auchnasheal merits no more than three paragraphs, two short and one long.
His letter to Mrs Thrale contained more detail, expressed with greater pungency, and it confirms the ‘Dark Continent’ feel of his experience: ‘The Inhabitants, a very coarse tribe, ignorant of any language but earse [sic], gathered so fast about us, that if we had not had Highlanders with us, they might have caused more alarm than pleasure.’
However, he does use his recollection of the journey over Ratagan, his eyes filled with mountains, to reflect in the Journey generally upon the condition of remoteness as it affects human beings, and thereby touches the core of his reasons for travelling.
Accordingly, we are treated to an immediate and excellent example of Johnson's mind at work.
He begins by summarising that for the obvious reasons of inaccessibility and defences, the peoples who reside among mountains are the last to be conquered: he progresses to consider similarly-caused impediments to civilisation: he deduces the part remoteness plays in the preservation of ancient languages.
From his discussion of how such isolated clans as the Macraes, in such hollows of the world as Auchnasheal, repel all boarders, Johnson opens up a discussion of how mankind in this condition regulates itself.
Having decided that the rude manners and customs of an outback community ‘are rather produced by their situation  than derived from their ancestors’, he examines first how they regulated themselves traditionally; then, the introduction and enforcement of the country's general body of legislation — for instance, theft of cattle from drovers had long been a problem in the Highlands; now their passage was growing safer.
And he moves up the scale from the creation of individual regional statutes, to address the law enforcement problems caused by peculiar geography, to the place of the law in the body politic.
At the lower end of his debate he describes how ‘in the Highlands it was a law, that if a robber was sheltered from justice, any man of the same clan might be taken in his place’; at the upper end, close to his conclusion, Johnson summarises: ‘As government advances towards perfection, provincial judicature is perhaps in every empire gradually abolished.’
In effect, he is tracing the means by which anthropologically quaint units decline.
The over-running and Anglicising of the Highlands after Culloden, when even the traditional form of dress was banned, would soon lead to assimilation, and even though‘the inhabitants of mountains form distinct races, and are careful to preserve their genealogies’, Johnson concludes without emotion that ‘while their rocks seclude them from the rest of mankind, and kept them an unaltered and distinctive race…they are now losing their distinction, and hastening to mingle with the general community.’
The passage, some three pages long and called ‘The Highlands’, is a masterly performance — notwithstanding the implicit condescension that such a wide region could be thus briefly treated.
It becomes a great pleasure to read this passage, another justification of those who assured me that A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland remains one of the fundamental works in the literature of travel.
Of climbing Ratagan (which they spelt in different ways: Boswell, ‘Ratakin': Johnson, ‘Ratiken’) in the early afternoon, Johnson confided in Mrs Thrale (to whom he spells it ‘Rattiken’)‘more difficulty than we had yet experienced’, a formidable demur, given the harshness of the ride out from Fort Augustus to Anoch.
To begin with, they left it too late — but, measuring the distance from Shiel Bridge way below and behind me, and  judging the terrain, even though this modern road has been impressively built, I do not know how they might have bettered their arrangements.
They could hardly have camped, and without exact locations for Anoch and Auchnasheal, I cannot say whether they would have improved their lot by aiming for Auchnasheal when leaving Fort Augustus, instead of breaking the journey at Anoch.
In any case, they breasted the height of Ratagan, and now the difficulty began in earnest.
Dr Johnson's weight interfered with his equestrian comfort, and ‘upon one of the precipices, my horse, weary with the steepness of the rise, staggered a little, and I called in haste to the Highlander to hold him.
This was the only moment of my journey, in which I thought myself endangered’— a surprising comment, given what lies ahead.
On the steep descent, things deteriorated further.
The guides suggested that Johnson, so as not to tire one horse wholly, should alternate between mounts.
But when he opted for either of John Hay's horses, they argued: Johnson had to settle for the grey owned by Laughland Vass.
They moved forward, Joseph Ritter bringing up the rear, Hay and Vass either side of Johnson's bridle, the great man clearly frightened.
John Hay, seeing Johnson's fear, talked to him all the time as to a child, trying to keep him cheerful, but this measure only excited Boswell's scorn, especially when he heard Hay trying to distract Johnson with the antics of the local goats.
‘Here now was a common ignorant Highland clown imagining that he could divert, as one does a child,— Dr Samuel Johnson!
The ludicrousness, absurdity, and extraordinary contrast between what the fellow fancied, and the reality, was truly comick.’
So they rode on through the twilight, the guides either side of Johnson soothing him forward.
At this point, Boswell decided he would hurry on ahead to secure their food and accommodation at Glenelg.
To his astonishment, Johnson yelled angrily at him and there broke out the most serious row the pair is reported ever to have had in their long association.
They even let the sun go down on their wrath.
As Boswell began to move off, Johnson called him back heatedly.
Boswell explained, patiently enough to judge from his text, that he merely intended to see that all was well at Glenelg, to which  Johnson replied, ‘Do you know, I should as soon have thought of picking a pocket as doing so?’
Boswell hit back: ‘I am diverted with you, sir,’ and Johnson laid him low: ‘Doing such a thing makes one lose confidence in him who has done it, as one cannot tell what he may do next.’
Matters did not improve when they got to Glenelg and found an appalling inn — although it did draw from Johnson one of his best remarks of the entire tour.
Reflecting that the place lacked milk, bread, eggs, and wine, he observed, ‘Of the provisions the negative catalogue was very copious.’
Someone sent somebody out to kill two hens; a local gentleman, knowing the lie of the land, sent his servant to the inn with rum and sugar and an apology for not knowing of their arrival in  sufficient time to put them up, and he had to leave for Inverness at the crack of dawn; Boswell still had some bread despite the amount he had doled out to the Macraes.
The landlord of this slate-roofed building cooked them mutton chops which proved inedible, and Johnson's supper, later traced in Boswell's notes, consisted of bread and a lemon.
When they got to the bedroom, further surprises awaited them: ‘Out of one of the beds, on which we were to repose, started up, at our entrance, a man black as Cyclops from the forge.’
Boswell found the room ‘damp and dirty, with bare walls, a variety of bad smells, a coarse black greasy fir table, and forms [benches]of the same kind’.
The guides, unable to find livery for the horses, found fresh hay for the beds and the quarrellers, still sullen with each other, retired.
Johnson slept on the hay in his huge-pocketed greatcoat; Boswell laid the sheets his wife had packed on top of the hay and, observed Johnson, ‘lay in linen like a gentleman’.
Eighteen days out of Edinburgh, they perched at the edge of the Hebrides.
‘The inquirer is kept in continual suspense’
FOR THE NEXT SEVEN WEEKS they moseyed around the Western Isles, often encountering rough weather: Skye, Raasay, Coll, Mull, Ulva, Inchkenneth and Iona.
Of Glenelg they saw little; after breakfast on Thursday, 2 September, having parted company with their guides John Hay and Laughland Vass, they walked down to the shore and were ferried to Skye.
Johnson and Boswell made up their quarrel when they rose, with Johnson saying he would not have turned back, as he had threatened, and headed for Edinburgh.
The weather cleared too, and they were rowed diagonally south-west across the Sound of Sleat.
Boswell measured the water journey from Glenelg as twelve miles; the boatman called it six miles, confusing old logical Johnson with the assertion that a mile on the land equated to two on the sea.
Their hosts for the first few days, the Lord of the Isles, Sir Alexander Macdonald, and his wife Jane, a relative of Boswell's, waited on the shore at Armadale, a small, dirty, sandy horseshoe of a bay, to greet them.
A portion of the original stone jetty still stands at Armadale, within sight of the modern ferry port linking Skye to Mallaig on the mainland.
Trees on the upland behind the harbour cloak the Macdonald estate.
At the pier, shops sell batiks and woollens to the ferry travellers: families with packed cars and roof-racks; men with sheepdogs on the way to trials at Mallaig; bikers on some kind of round robin according to their luggage tags —‘Genève-Edinburgh-Brugge-Genève’.
The distant mountains form the backcloth of an opera set.
Skye is called the winged, or flying, island.
On the map, or from high in the air, it looks like a proud bird, profiled like a phoenix.
On my first visit, several years ago, I saw — and they   are unmistakable — eagles.
Near Portree, ‘the harbour of the king’— James V, rather of Mary, Queen of Scots, once sailed in — I lay on heathland and watched first one, then another, high against the clear blue sky.
Such grace: they soar and wheel, the lions of the air.
One Skye man told me how, sitting on his lawn one afternoon, he heard a sudden great beating of wings and like passing royalty an eagle swooped low across the trees.
Although not the only outsiders to record the place — Johnson's favourite travel writers Martin Martin and Thomas pennant made copious observations — the visit of Johnson and Boswell to the isle became a significant part of Skye's history, on account of the extent of their commentaries and the literary distinction they have retained.
Johnson considered as many aspects of life here as he could possibly think of, or so it seems: and Boswell recorded Johnson with similar energy.
Their experience of the island became comprehensive; they visited the south, then the east, then the north-east, then the north-west, the west and back to the south  again.
Weather did not deter them; it rained most of the time and they traversed ground that had little or no trace of thoroughfare.
On Skye, Johnson hit his anthropologist's and historian's strides.
In the Macdonald household at Armadale, he asked questions busily and settled himself to a general spirit of enquiry, the fruits of which he then presents in his Journey.
He begins with a complimentary description of the walled orchard, which had survived the destruction of the castle in the years following the ‘45.
A visiting fossilist from Aberdeenshire drew Johnson's attention to a species of ash tree, enabling the great man to support his recurring arboreal obsession: ‘The present nakedness of the Hebrides is not wholly the fault of Nature.’
Johnson heard bagpipes at Armadale, and a story to accompany them — of a past Macdonald aggression against a family in Culloden, whom the Macdonalds locked in their church one Sunday morning and torched, this being the tune played while the flames danced.
Johnson's commentary upon this tale airs his willingness to take in everything and give it back out again: ‘Narrations like this, however uncertain, deserve the notice of the traveller, because they are the only records of a nation that has no historians, and afford the most genuine representation of the life and character of the ancient Highlanders.’
He next examines the Hebridean footwear —‘Brogues, a kind of artless shoes, stitched with thongs so loosely, that though they defend the foot from stones, they do not exclude water.’
The wearing of Highland dress, the speaking of Erse, the weather —; his observations begin with the commonplace and are taken by his mind up on to the plateau of thought.
In this, his value always exceeds Boswell's; Johnson the writer has no need to grind the axe of his ego, and thereby feels no qualms in conveying how confusing he finds the native Scots, who, decisive and firm in their answer to his first question, are likely to contradict it entirely in answering the second question.
He observes, not unamusedly, ‘such is the laxity of Highland conversation, that the inquirer is kept in continual suspense, and by a kind of intellectual retrogradation, knows less as he hears more.’
Boswell's reflections upon their first four days on Skye ring with a different clang, and behind his final edition of his Journal  of a Tourlies a curly history.
He disliked Sir Alexander Macdonald, a view shared by many: it originally stemmed from unfavourable comparison with Alexander's older brother, the late, much-loved, James.
On his own account, though, Alexander possessed the opposite of generosity, had a pompous air, offensive self-importance and had embraced his Eton education and all things southern too warmly (not a word he otherwise inspired) for the liking of his fellow-Scots.
Boswell loathed him so much that his first edition of the Tour to the Hebrides had to be amended  on account of the unflattering position he took on Sir Alexander.
Excisions, notes and actual published first edition refer to Sir Alexander's reputation for racking up his tenants' rents unfairly and harshly; and to noticeable meanness —‘he has disgusted all mankind by injudicious parsimony’; Boswell originally told of Sir Alexander asking a visitor whether the punch-bowl on the table in front of them were not indeed very handsome.
The guest replied, ‘It would be — if it were full.’
When he read the remarks in the first edition, the Lord of the Isles wrote angrily to Boswell; a duel might have been fought had Boswell not agreed to edit out offending passages next time around.
At the Clan Donald centre in Skye, near whose grounds stood the house in which the pair stayed, some relevant legalistic correspondence between the two may be seen.
Thomas Rowlandson capped the matter — which had become public knowledge — in his final Boswell cartoon, called ‘Revising the Second Edition’, which shows a terrified Boswell being grabbed by the throat; Lord Macdonald is pointing with his stick to the offending pages of the first edition and Boswell is complying in terror.
The edition of Boswell's Tour now generally available only refers obliquely to a lack of warmth, and to Boswell's own ‘spleen’ while staying there — all this notwithstanding that the beautiful (and pregnant) Lady Macdonald was a cousin of Boswell's.
Although the clan is diffuse now, a cohesion lingers: Macdonalds all over the world contribute to the funding of the Clan Donald Centre, a well-run and surprisingly unembarrassing tourist, residential and archival institute for the celebration of the name.
On Monday, 6 September 1773, Boswell and Johnson left the home of Sir Alexander Macdonald and set off on horseback to a staging-post near their embarkation point for Raasay.
Beyond Broadford (which Boswell calls ‘Broadfoot’), past today's electricity installations, down a long roadway, lies the farm at which they stayed, and some remains of the original house still stand.
The Mackinnons lived here, on land owned by the Macdonalds, ‘of the first rank of tenants’, Johnson wrote to Mrs Thrale, ‘where we were entertained better than the landlords’.
Shortened to ‘Corry’ nowadays, known locally as ‘old Corry’, the pair's spelling again differed, with Johnson calling it ‘Coriatachan’and Boswell ‘Corrichatachin': the Ordnance Survey calls it ‘Coirechat-achan’.
(The Mackinnons hosted them here twice, the second time being at the end of September after the pair had crossed the island to catch a boat for islands south of Skye.)
‘From Armidel,’ writes Johnson, ‘we came at night to Coriatachan, a house very pleasantly situated between two brooks, with one of the highest hills of the island behind it.’
as if it had happened a few years ago, Mr Donal John MacLennan, leaning on his metal gate as his sheep thronged the pens of today's farm at Corry, knew that Johnson and Boswell had been guests in this place, and that they had had good times here.
On their first stay the Mackinnons gave them ‘the comfort of a table fully furnished’, and a party that night with songs in Gaelic, in whose choruses even Boswell joined.
Other buildings have taken over at Corry, and at their rear the blond old wall of the original house stretches under the shade of a tree in this hollow full of little rivers.
The travellers' response to this place was positive and warm, and this does not simply derive from the contrast with the pompous inhospitality they found at Armadale, where they were perhaps disgruntled at staying only in an estate official's house (the mansion had been burnt down), even if the laird and his lady stayed with them.
At the Mackinnons they entered the true spirit of the west of Scotland, the ‘kindly and tooty’ people of the song ‘Westering Home’.
Alexander Macdonald had clearly abandoned much of that hospitable tradition, perhaps owing to his embrace of southern education, or perhaps as a reaction to the affection in which his  late brother had been held.
The Mackinnons belonged closer to the ground of Skye, an open house where all strata mingled easily.
Johnson wrote, ‘We were treated with very liberal hospitality, among a more numerous and elegant company than it could have been supposed easy to collect.’
The Edinburgh effect had begun to work again, the great man come to visit, a fact which Johnson pleasedly concedes a couple of paragraphs earlier, when he observes, ‘The arrival of strangers at a place so rarely visited, excites rumour, and quickens curiosity.’
In Skye, Johnson's text begins to grow denser, and he gives the appearance, almost, of wishing to record every moment.
An impression also grows that when he reached Skye, having ‘conceived’, during his little mountain idyll, ‘the thought of this narration’, Johnson, emulating Boswell, has now begun to take notes.
He made his eighteenth-century reader aware of the travel difficulties, and how they were surmounted — on steep hills by precipices the Highlander and his horse go carefully, the rider sometimes walking, always with a guide: ‘The horseman has always at his side a native of the place, who, by pursuing game, or tending cattle, or often being employed in messages or conduct, has learned where the ridge of the hill has breadth sufficient to allow a horse and his rider a passage, and where the moss or bog is hard enough to bear them.’
To Mrs Thrale he wrote, ‘No part that I have seen is plain; you are always climbing or descending, and every step is upon rock or mire.
A walk upon ploughed ground in England is a dance upon carpets, compared to the toilsome drudgery of wandering in Skye…
The use of travelling is to regulate imagination by reality…’
He summarised continuously — the manners and mores of the people, the scale of hospitality, the diet, and the disposition of the household in which he stayed, the more ‘ordinary’ the folk the greater Johnson's detail.
When all the consequences of his account are added up, it transpires that he created a permanent and invaluable record of an ancient way of life — not at first as antique as he had hoped, but he was not ungratified at the glimpses of the past that he caught.
Johnson's reflections under the heading of ‘Coriatachan in Sky’ amount to only eighteen hundred words or so, yet they constitute  the clearest view of him I have had so far, the best opportunity to try and assess what made him.
If great writing may principally be a matter of fine and large spirit expressed in outstanding technique, to my eye, as I still acquaint myself with him, Johnson triumphs by combining a welcoming mind with an economy of expression, so that he shares the maximum of observed experience in the minimum of words.
In this, so difficult to achieve, he towers.
Never leaving us to feel that he has short-changed us, each observation complete in itself, as if it has been roundly considered before utterance, he manages to accommodate the following items of interest in that eighteen hundred words: a comparison between Hebridean manners of burial and Roman funeral rites; the weather (repeatedly); the literacy of the Hebrideans; how travellers are accommodated, there being no hotel system; diet — wild-fowl, fish, venison, beef, mutton, goat, poultry, bread; whisky for breakfast (the morning dram, known as a ‘skalk’); the availability of tea, coffee, marmalade and other preserves, honey and cheese; trading practices — wine from the French in exchange for wool; culinary variety, short on vegetables other than potatoes, not good on custards; napery, crockery and cutlery; the abating fervour of the clans in the wake of Culloden; and he believed he saw the slow rise of prosperity under the ‘unpleasing consequences of subjection,.
The ‘Coriatachan in Sky’ passage, the first of the great Hebridean discourses in Johnson's Journey, displays a writer confident that he is imparting information and reflection in sufficient quantities to excite both the reader's thought and imagination — and yet not so lengthy as to bore them, nor so brief as to frustrate them.
Boswell's counterpoint to this recitative divulges that among their books the Mackinnons had the shorter version of Johnson's own Dictionary, and that, notwithstanding the merry and warm respect they received from the household, the place began to feel like a prison on account of the adverse weather.
By contrast, while Boswell fretted and twitched, Johnson wrote a brace of Odes, one to honour the Isle of Skye, the other for his friend Hester Thrale.
Both in Latin, they received much admiration when they entered the wider world.
In conversation at Corry, Johnson heard the stories he longed for — of men seeing visions, of examples of ‘second sight’ on Skye; Mrs Mackinnon's father had once met some women who, while working in a field, heard ghostly voices, signifying imminent death; he later met two funerals at the predicted place.
Behind Boswell's published account of his fidgety stay at the Mackinnons' — he felt so lethargic that he did not encourage Johnson to talk so that he would not have to write it down — lies some oddity.
Bearing in mind that after the stinginess of Armadale he had gone to the house of this ‘hearty welcome’, and had been pleased with ‘a numerous and cheerful company’— why did Boswell prove less forthcoming than one might have expected about the Mackinnons?
Snobbery may provide one answer: in his supposed solidarity with his own kind, he may not have wished to suggest that a tenant farmer could prove more generous of spirit than the laird.
Fear may have contributed — fear of Sir Alexander's wrath.
He could have been forgiven had he waxed much more lyrical.
Indeed, he cut from his published version his original account of the hospitality they experienced — a pity because it constituted a valuable little sliver of social history, describing their arrival in ‘a low parlour’ of this two-storeyed house, to be greeted with tea from a silver service.
Supper was as lavish as they had yet had in Scotland: ‘A large dish of minced beef collops, a large dish of fricassee of fowl, I believe a dish called fried chicken or something like it, a dish of ham or tongue, some excellent haddocks, some herrings, a large bowl of rich milk, frothed, as good a bread-pudding as I ever tasted, full of raisin and lemon or orange peel, and sillabubs made with port wine and in sillabub glasses.
There was a good table-cloth with napkins; china, silver spoons, porter if we chose it, and a large bowl of very good punch.’
When Boswell awoke on Wednesday, 8 September, the wind had died, but the rain persisted.
It eventually cleared and after breakfast they prepared to go to Raasay; they would see the Mackinnons again in two weeks or so.
Boswell's account says they rode two miles to the shore to find a herring-boat which would take them out to Raasay.
Today, a ferry crosses from the shore of Loch Sligachan, considerably  more than two miles from Corry; waiting on the simple pier at Sconser, the vessel can be seen leaving Raasay, preceded by a small bow-wave.
The Raasay ferry takes only a handful of vehicles and rather more passengers, and travels frequently, and if the ferryman finds that he has no room for you on his last run of the day from Raasay back to Sconser he will return.
On a fine mid-morning, the water at Sconser is glowingly clear, a kind of northern coral sea, and with boats bobbing on moorings near the back-gardens of their owners' cottages; a few lobster pots, a net drying in the light sunshine.
Boswell's and Johnson's footsteps can no longer be seen around Armadale and Sleat; so far, only Corry retains their memory, in that old stretch of white crumbling wall.
Johnson found the whole island harsh and barren; to Mrs Thrale he wrote, ‘though I have been twelve days upon it, I have little to say.’
Yet his journey from the beautiful south to Corry took him through scenery which is today lovely.
This part of Skye, wooded and lush, benefits from any warmth lingering in the North Atlantic Drift.
Can it have changed much — or did it rain so pre-emptively that he cannot have noticed the lovely inlets at Isleornsay, their green banked lands sloping to soft-coloured waters?
He ignites the imagination, nevertheless, with glancing observations of Skye ‘…so much indented by inlets of the Sea, that there is no part of it removed from the water by more than six miles’.
Before they left for Raasay, there arrived at the Mackinnons' a card and two visitors.
The card was written by the Reverend Donald McQueen and told them that the Laird of Raasay had sent his own boat for them; the reverend gentleman himself arrived shortly afterwards; ‘an elderly man,’ says Boswell, ‘with his own black hair, courteous and rather slow of speech, but candid, sensible and well-informed.’
Mr McQueen, who would be with them for some weeks, was accompanied by one of the Macleods of Raasay to pilot them, Malcolm Macleod, aged sixty-two.
To judge from Boswell's description, Macleod cut as representative a figure of Hebridean or Highland imagery as any folklore could have created, a hero straight out of Scott or Stevenson or Tranter: bearded, ruddy-cheeked, lively-eyed, wearing brogues, tartan  stockings, ‘a black waistcoat, a short green cloth coat bound with gold cord, a yellowish bushy wig, a large blue bonnet with gold thread button’.
He also wore ‘a purple camblet kilt’: sartorial defiance: the kilt had been banned after the ‘45 in which the Macleods played a significant part, not least in assisting Bonnie prince Charlie to escape.
‘Camblet’, a word as old as Marco polo, or even springing from earlier Arabic associations, connects into ‘Camelot’, fine cloth, finer than camelhair with which it became commonly associated, finer than wool, as fine as silk itself and perhaps a combination of camel and wool and silk.
To wear a kilt of camblet denoted a singular man — such as Malcolm Macleod of Raasay.
The boat had been made in Norway.
‘The water was calm,’ says Johnson, ‘and the [four]rowers were vigorous.’
Boswell, who says the high wind blew in their faces, described one of the oarsmen, ‘a Macleod, a robust, black-haired fellow, half-naked, and bear-headed, something between a wild Indian and an English tar.
Dr Johnson sat high on the stern, like a magnificent Triton.’
On Skye, Boswell's writing changed character, and became lyrical, more poised, vigorous and clear, as if the elements and the landscape lifted him.
Perhaps his heart and mind leaped together at the daily realisation of his dream to take his beloved Johnson on this tour to these parts.
The short journey to Raasay proved vivid.
Malcolm Macleod sang a heroic song in Gaelic, with the boatmen and the Reverend Mr McQueen taking up the chorus.
Passing Scalpay, Johnson suggested to Boswell that they buy the island, ‘found a good school’ on it, and an episcopal church, ‘and have a printing-press where he would print all the Erse that could be found’.
Rounding the corner of Scalpay, the weather of the open sea hit the boat and their faces, and Johnson, though uncomfortable, again reached for, and found, the humorous and positive: ‘This is now the Atlantick.
If I should tell at a tea table in London, that I have crossed the Atlantick in an open boat, how they'd shudder, and what a fool they'd think me to expose myself to such danger.’
Johnson increases in delight; how many edges he gives to an observation.
A small boat journey becomes a crossing of the ocean; and continuing the mimicry of aggrandisement, he  anticipates satirically the throwing-up of London's hands at his folly — and by implicit contrast, how much more adventurous and un-foppish he appears, while yet mocking himself.
In the open sea, Joseph Ritter — always there beneath the text or in the shadows of Boswell's narrative — mystifyingly lost Johnson's spurs overboard.
How?
Had he laid them in the bottom of the boat, or on the seat beside him — and a little wave swept them away?
And why not have placed them for safe keeping in a pocket, satchel or valise?
Johnson, after a moment of being stung at this carelessness, dismissed it as ‘rather an inconvenience than a loss’, and went on to use the incident to defend his views on the second sight.
He had dreamt the night before of losing his walking-stick on the current of a stream.
The Reverend McQueen countered, and spoke with the authority of one who, in order to rout the local belief in witchcraft, had had to preach aggressively from his own pulpit.
Near Raasay, a charming gleam comes from Boswell —‘the singing of our rowing was succeeded by that of reapers’, the same song heard in a differently enchanting place by the Lady of Shalott.
They must have had such a pleasing approach to Raasay House; the bay of their arrival seems unlikely to have changed, a wide and gentle place, now full of windsurfers — the mansion where they stayed now houses an Adventure School.
The modern ferry comes in a good deal farther south, beneath slabs of World War Two concrete fortifications.
A welcoming party of six walked down to the shore as the boating party disembarked not without difficulty; Johnson, after his six or seven hours on the Atlantic, found the rocks ‘irregularly broken, and a false step would have been very mischievous’.
More intensely than Skye, the smaller canvas of Raasay plunged Johnson straight into the life of the islanders.
The men greeting Johnson included the Laird, his doctor brother, and four other Macleod relatives, including one, known as Sandie, who had been exiled for his part with the Jacobites in 1745.
It becomes clear from Boswell's descriptions that this family were considerably less Anglicised than the Macdonalds on Skye, and still remained on the side of the Gaels.
In keeping with Sandie Macleod's fighting  on behalf of the clans, the Laird himself, although straitened by low incomes from his estates, had never racked his rents and as a consequence, says Boswell, ‘so far is he from distressing his people, that, in the present rage for emigration, not a man has left his estate.’
Up at the house waited Lady Raasay with her family — three sons and ten daughters.
Brandy was poured immediately, and ‘On a side-board was placed for us, who had come off the sea, a substantial dinner, and a variety of wines.’
Boswell does not record whether Johnson accepted a drink; nor has he recorded Johnson taking alcohol on the journey so far.
(Six years later, according to the Life, Johnson ‘harangued’ at Joshua Reynolds's house ‘upon the qualities of different liquors’, and coined the much-quoted ‘Claret is the liquor for boys; port, for men; but he who aspires to be a hero must drink brandy.’)
Johnson told Mrs Thrale, ‘We went up into a dining-room about as large as your blue room, where we had something given us to eat, and tea and coffee.’
Soon they rolled back the carpet and had a dance.
A slight divergence appears here in the separate chronologies; Boswell gives the impression they danced after supper; Johnson says, ‘When it was time to sup, the dance ceased, and thirty persons sat down to two tables in the same room.
After supper the ladies sung Erse songs, to which I listened as an English audience to an Italian opera, delighted with the sound of words which I did not understand.’
He had landed in the midst of the true hospitality and zest of the west of Scotland.
They came to Raasay House on the evening of Wednesday, 8 September, and stayed for four nights, a shorter stay than their first spell on Skye.
Yet, as if some kind of mathematical progression took hold of him, Johnson's accounts of the several places in which he found himself, get longer, with Raasay the longest so far.
He wrote a detailed set of observations — an entire territory, as it were, under his eye as a jewel to a watchmaker's glass.
The society of Raasay was so self-contained that he could hold it in his palm and turn it this way and that.
Thus, he acquainted himself with the meanings of the songs he heard them singing, songs of love and emigration; with inheritances and alliances between these  western chieftains; with the size and topography of Raasay and its suitability for animal husbandry.
He found trees on Raasay, and saw the trout from their streams but not the eels, which prompts him towards thoughts on national culinary abhorrences: ‘The Neapolitans lately refused to eat potatoes in a famine.
An Englishman is not easily persuaded to dine on snails with an Italian, on frogs with a Frenchman, or on horse-flesh with a Tartar,’ and then leads into a discussion which philosophically connects the natural foods of nations with the natural development of man's society.
pondering the absence on Raasay of deer, hares and rabbits, and expanding to discuss beasts of prey, he begins to give a picture of a small island community in the eighteenth century as comprehensively and economically as any reader could desire.
The compactness of the place, as Johnson found it, may still be touched.
He reckoned that the population of the day numbered somewhere between six and nine hundred people, but he based this on the fact that the laird pressed together an army of a hundred men for the ‘45, and according to Johnson ‘the sixth part of a people is supposed capable of bearing arms’.
Allowing for the fact that not every man would hear the call, and that the laird would wish to leave a number of men to guard the place, he then bumped up the arithmetic to suppose nine hundred inhabitants.
By the road from the ferry to Raasay House, small neat houses appear, bright colourful gardens, attentively tended, gleaming in the sunshine.
Sports reporters are reputed to gauge crowds well; who measures populations at a glance?
I cannot tell how many people live on Raasay today; nine hundred would seem a high estimate although in the interior of the island, houses appear unexpectedly like mushrooms in the grass.
A quiet life, but an exquisite one visually, on this long narrow island, on whose southern forested hills the poet Sorley Maclean found that ‘Time, the deer, is in the wood of Hallaig.’
Behind Raasay House there still stands ‘a chapel unroofed and ruinous’.
Is it the same as Johnson described?
This small graveyard contains the ‘repositories for the dead’ of the Macleod generations.
Once more appears the value of the difference between Johnson's discursiveness and Boswell's practical observations.
Johnson used  the little family cemetery to break into a contemplation of Martin Martin's journey and then lead to a consideration of roofless churches as an exemplar and a herald of the eventual decline of religion.
Boswell brings us to the very bones — literally — of their excursion to the churchyard behind the stable-block.
‘A little to the west of the house is an old, ruinous chapel, unroofed, which never has been very curious.
We here saw some human bones of an uncommon size.
There was a heel-bone, in particular, which Dr Macleod said was such, that if the foot was in proportion, it must have been twenty-seven inches long.
Dr Johnson would not look at the bones.
He started back from them with a striking appearance of horror…’
Excellent though Johnson has so far proven at the explorer's notes, Boswell threatens to outdo him regarding Raasay.
It is from Boswell that we learn of the height of nun Can, Raasay's peak on which he danced a Highland reel with old Malcolm Macleod who called him between five and six in the morning to go walking.
Boswell is the one who tells us the legend of the seahorse from the lakes who devoured a man's daughter, and was eventually trapped by the lure of a sow on a spit; from Boswell we learn that of the hundred-strong little army the Laird of Raasay mustered, eighty-six came back from Culloden; Boswell chronicles the ash and plane trees, the limestone rocks, the caves and their stalactites, the black cattle, the plover, the pigeons and blackcock, the rainfall, nine months in a year, the juniper, the peat, the belief in the existence of a gold mine, and the women wawking or waulking the tweed, a tedious operation where the tweed is rubbed over and through water in order to shrink and thicken it (in the outer Hebrides they add their own urine to the vat, although Bozzie missed that one), and the women sang a worksong to accompany the rhythmic labour, and did not succeed in drowning out Johnson's deep voice as he asked them questions.
From Boswell we learn that the Laird of Macleod was in debt to the tune of forty thousand pounds, and this Hebridean Micawber had an income of only thirteen hundred a year.
They danced every night.
Boswell reported: ‘The queen of our ball was the eldest Miss Macleod, of Rasay, an elegant, well-bred woman, and celebrated for her beauty all over these regions, by the name of Miss Flora Rasay.
There seemed to be no jealousy, no discontent among them; and the gaiety of the scene was such that I for a moment doubted whether unhappiness had any place in Rasay.’
Of the celebrated Miss Flora, Johnson wrote to Mrs Thrale that she ‘dresses her head very high, and has manners so ladylike, I wish her headdress was lower’.
When Boswell had completed his own adventuring on Raasay, he turned his attention, as usual, to making Dr Johnson sparkle: ‘Let me now gather some gold dust — some more fragments of Dr Johnson's conversation, without regard to order of time.’
Raasay had a smaller familiarity with the topics on which Dr Johnson was likely to speak.
Boswell tried all the same, but reported only one ‘typical’ conversation of any length.
It took place on Friday, 10 September, and only between Johnson and Boswell; Johnson talked of four people, Richard Bentley, David Mallet, the Duchess of Marlborough and Joseph Hooke.
It was an exchange of literary gossip, having to do with the finances of  writing, and the ‘ghosting’ of the Marlborough memoirs, and would have meant nothing to the dancing, chattering folk in Raasay House.
Apart from that, and a brief exchange with Boswell on one of the Macleod family, it was now clear that Johnson found little stimulation on Raasay: ‘There was not enough of intellectual entertainment for him, after he had satisfied his curiosity, which he did, by asking questions, till he had exhausted the island’: does Boswell mean the topic of Raasay or its people?
Johnson himself concluded that ‘Raasay has little that can detain a traveller, except the laird and his family’; and in their ‘feat of hospitality’ he found a ‘delightful contrariety of images.
Without is the rough ocean and the rocky land, the beating billows and the howling storm; within is plenty and elegance, beauty and gaiety, the song and the dance.’
On a sunny Sunday morning they left Raasay.
Despite their qualms of travelling on the Sabbath, they took the weather as it came to them and sailed back to Skye, landing in the harbour of Portree.
Beyond Raasay House today, the road winds inland, an excellent road for so small an island.
Then, like hope, energy or money, the road runs out just when you need it.
Small farms may be seen in the valleys, and, in patches at least, the crofters of Raasay would appear to have good, green land.
From the first heights heading north, the sails of the Adventure School's windsurfers may be seen like pictures in a child's storybook on the glimmering water.
This, rather than Inch Keith or Scalpay, would have been the island for Johnson.
Raasay has an atmosphere of independence: had the Macleods ever declared a Republic of Raasay, the place feels as if the idea might have taken hold.
Someone once felt it worth fortifying; beneath grey-white nun Can, a castle stands at the roadside, formidable and hostile even in bright warm sunshine.
Bees enquire within the heather overlooking the sea.
Boswell spent an energetic time on Raasay; he walked almost the entire island and had his dance on top of Dun Can.
For once, if briefly, the biographical positions are reversed, when Johnson writes to Mrs Thrale describing Boswell's doings. ‘on the third  day Boswel [sic]went out with old Malcolm to see a ruined castle, which he found less entire than was promised, but he saw the country.’
The building they stayed in and entered from the (largely unchanged) foreshore may now be found behind a later front; the walls of the Raasay House Johnson slept in are held prisoner within the nineteenth-century accreted façade; one or two corridors may be seen and touched.
After the Macleods' modest grandeur and great hospitality, Raasay House became a hotel, and now the bare boards of the Adventure School thud with young feet; they sleep in bunks and merry community where Johnson had a room to himself, which, as he told Mrs Thrale, ‘in eleven rooms to forty people was more than my share’.
He further speculated that with a room to Boswell, and one for the laird, ‘there remained eight rooms only for at least seven and thirty lodgers.
I suppose they put temporary beds in the diningroom…there was a room above stairs with six beds in which they put ten men.’
That night, I read again their separate accounts of Raasay, to see what I had missed: the streams of which Johnson wrote, ‘one of the brooks turns a cornmill, and at least one produces trouts’;, the garden, described by Boswell, ‘plentifully stocked with vegetables, and strawberries, raspberries, currants, etc.’; and a swift passing observation in one of Johnson's letters to Hester Thrale, a reference he does not include in his official text.
His politics, as exemplified by this omission, again prove intriguing and his almost furtive observation hands me on to my next destination.
Johnson had told Mrs Thrale a little of the four-hundred-year history of Raasay (or ‘Raarsa’ as he calls it)— and then he divulged that Bonnie Prince Charlie ‘was hidden in his distress two nights at Raarsa, and the king's troops burnt the whole country, and killed some of the Cattle’.
They made swift work of Portree where they landed on the Sunday afternoon.
Boswell, but not, oddly, Johnson, looked over an emigrant ship in the harbour.
After lunch they set off to Kingsburgh for one of their most memorable encounters.
It merits the longest entry devoted to any one person in Boswell's account, and no more than two sentences in Johnson's: the person they met  was Flora Macdonald, who had helped Bonnie Prince Charlie to escape after Culloden.
The harbour of Portree, the principal town on Skye, is, as Boswell observed, ‘a large and good one’, and from it the road climbs up into the town, now much built since 1773 — a square, several banks, a school, and many, many tourists.
In the hotels at night they provide ‘Highland Evenings’— kilts, pipers, stout balladeers, male and female, and little girls in tartan dresses and white socks dancing like precise, muscled wraiths between wooden swords to the music of accordion, fiddle and piano.
One shy-faced fawn performed ‘Flora Macdonald's Fancy’.
The naming of tunes in Gaelic dancing has as much to do with the whim of the moment as with anything portentous: ‘Upstairs in a Tent’, or ‘The Clock on the Dresser’, or ‘The Walls of Limerick, owe more to whimsy in the kitchen on the night than to any attempt by the musician to give his tune immortality.
Likewise, perhaps, ‘Flora Macdonald's Fancy’—‘A name,’ wrote Johnson in his Journey, ‘that will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues mentioned with honour.
She is a woman of middle stature, soft features, gentle manners and elegant presence.’
She had borne seven children and was in her fifty-first year in 1773, when, on that September Sunday evening she entertained, and played hostess overnight, to her famous English visitor and his plump little annotator from Edinburgh, who wrote of Flora: ‘She is a little woman, of a genteel appearance, and uncommonly mild and well-bred.’
The A850, having come north from Broadford, leaves Portree for the north-west of Skye and after a few miles, just beyond the standing stones by Borve, splits into the A856.
After Kensaleyre, this beautiful road, a territory of hawks, runs by Loch Snizort Beag, and from the calm grassy uplands, well-to-do houses look down on the waters where the opportunities for boats seem infinite.
The scenery up here has been arresting so far; now it takes on an unexpectedly serene beauty.
Flora Macdonald lived in a small farm estate, off this road.
Nothing remains of the house where the Pretender hid and where Johnson and Boswell stayed: a few stones peeping forth from grassy old mounds, within new  unruly sycamores and sprouting ashes.
Trees guard the house from the east winds; meadows slope down to the water.
Nobody nearby knew the location of the well a little farther on, from which Bonnie Prince Charlie drank.
The outlines of the old house can just about be traced: lumps in the ground, grass-covered old rubble.
A reclusive woman lives on the site today, with a fierce and deterring desire to protect her privacy.
They stayed at Kingsburgh on Sunday night, having first been greeted by Flora's husband, another archetype of a fine Highland figure.
Says Boswell, ‘He had his Tartan plaid thrown about him, a large blue bonnet with a knot of black riband like a cockade, a brown short coat of a kind of duffil [thick-napped cloth], a Tartan waistcoat with gold buttons and gold button-holes, a bluish philibeg,[or filibeg, or kilt]and Tartan hose.
He had jet black hair tied behind, and was a large stately man, with a steady sensible countenance.’
Flora Macdonald's fancy, Allan, had married her in 1750 when she was twenty-eight.
Born in South Uist, she became and remains a most famous woman in Scottish history, epitomising forever the more acceptable of the romances associated with the Stuart cause.
On a June night in 1746, she disguised the haughty Prince as her Irish maid, ‘Betty Bourke’, and went with him/her in an open boat from Benbecula to the seat on Skye of Sir Alexander Macdonald.
Flora's coolness carried her through a dinner attended by the head of a platoon of soldiers on Skye to apprehend the Prince, who was then conducted to Raasay.
The Pretender nearly gave the game away by holding his skirts too high crossing a stream: ‘some women whom they met reported that they had seen a very big woman, who looked like a man in woman's clothes.’
The Flora Macdonald section of Boswell's Journal lasts for over three thousand words, and in the detail of any one single meeting or encounter enjoyed throughout their whole journey, nothing else compares with it.
It came about because, after an early night in the same bed as that slept in by the Prince, Dr Johnson, who had a cold and had been rendered a little deaf by it, ‘spoke of Prince Charles being here, and asked Mrs Macdonald, ‘Who was with him?
We were told, madam, in England, there was one Miss Flora Macdonald with him.’
She said, ‘They were very right.’’
She then launched into an account so detailed that Johnson said to Boswell, ‘All this should be written down,’ and Boswell did, in a faithful rendition that traces every move made by the prince and those who wished him to escape — every hardship, close call and incident, every hope, frustration and despair.
Beneath the oral history lies a sad text of spies, betrayers, official reprisal and oppression, and heartrending devotion: ‘Old Mrs Macdonald, after her guest had left the house, took the sheets in which he had lain, folded them carefully, and charged her daughter that they should be kept unwashed, and that, when she died, her body should be wrapped in them as a winding sheet.
Her will was religiously observed.’
Kingsburgh, Flora's father-in-law-to-be, gave the Prince a pair of new shoes and, when they were returned to him, kept them as treasured souvenirs.
‘After his death, a zealous Jacobite gentleman gave twenty guineas for them.’
Bonnie Prince Charlie had a price of thirty thousand pounds on his head when he was being ferried hither and yon across many isles and sea-lochs of the Hebrides, and yet, and yet — the people of the west, such as Flora Macdonald and Malcolm Macleod of Raasay, risked their lives for a man they must have known in their hearts was a lost cause.
Where Johnson exercised great prudence in his remarks, both in his own text and in his letters to Mrs Thrale, Boswell took a different line; having concluded his great notation of Flora Macdonald's exciting tale, Boswell summarised that for all the Highlanders’ dedication to the Stuart Cause, he ‘found every where among them a high opinion of the virtues of the King now upon the throne, and an honest disposition to be faithful subjects to his majesty…’
Were he not so useful and entertaining on his main subject, Boswell might easily call all his facts into question by such a blatant lie, so blatantly told to curry Establishment favour in London.
Did he sincerely hope to persuade his readers that the Gaels of the west of Scotland uncritically adored George III?
Moving down the open field at Kingsburgh, a view of the sea-loch comes into view, wide and bright, the view from her window every morning until Flora Macdonald and her husband left to try and increase their fortunes in America.
They emigrated  a year after they met Johnson.
In this they had no luck; the War of Independence broke out while they were in the Carolinas, and they came home no richer, if wiser.
On the Monday afternoon, Flora Macdonald's husband conducted the travellers to his boat, and took them across Loch Snizort Beag, out a little into Loch Snizort, around what is now called Lyndale Point and into Loch Grishinish, or Greshornish.
They might have fared more comfortably had they sailed a longer journey — from Kingsburgh up to Waternish point, a journey which would then have taken them directly down into Loch Dunvegan — although local people told me the weather here can come up very quickly, and perhaps Allan Macdonald's boat was not adequately large.
The Rev. Donald McQueen, ‘the most intelligent man in Skye’, was still with them, and while under sail he proceeded to give Johnson a pithy and useful outline of the landlord and tenant system as it operated, and as it proved unworkable.
The tacksmen, he told Johnson, were emigrating, unable to comply with the exorbitant rents demanded by the lairds and deluded by the dreams of wealth they had promised their own tenants.
(A tacksman, in Boswell's phrase, was ‘a large taker or leaseholder of land, of which he keeps part as a domain in his own hand, and lets part to under-tenants’:.
Flora Macdonald's father was a tacksman.)
Their lands were now being occupied by poorer people, their former servants, who had not the means, nor, to judge from McQueen's words, the energies or capacities to work the land properly; by such measures were they witnessing the reduction of the great Scottish holdings.
Boswell's observation that the King should intervene to stop people being forced from the land was augmented by Johnson's opinion that ‘were an oppressive chieftain a subject of the French king, he would probably be admonished…’
On the boat, Johnson asked about ‘the use of the dirk, with which he imagined the Highlanders cut their meat’, and was told they also had knives and forks, that the men tended to hand the knives and forks to the women after they had cut their own meat which they then ate from their hands, and that one old Macdonald retainer always ate fish with his fingers, claiming that ‘a knife and fork gave it a bad taste’.
At Greshornish, their horses, says Boswell, ‘had been sent around by road to meet us.
By this sail we saved eight miles of bad riding.’
Johnson disliked the riding he had experienced on Skye, complaining of its ‘unsocial’ nature, owing to the usual narrowness of the way which never permitted two abreast; and, he said, ‘you cannot indulge in meditation by yourself, because you must be always attending to the steps which your horse takes’.
Greshornish lies at the end of a long narrow road connecting with the A850; a calm and green place with blue, long waters, and a profusion of rabbits on the lawns of the hotel.
From there they rode to Dunvegan, either more or less as the crow flies by a drovers' trail, or coming down from Greshornish to join what is now the A850, at a point about half-way between Portree and their destination, Dunvegan Castle.
Johnson's cold, still in its first phase — three days coming, three days staying, three days going — was getting worse.
He did not have a good journey from Greshornish; the ground proved so soft that he frequently had to dismount and walk.
Nevertheless, his energy of observation remained constant and again inclined towards the economics of the area: he contemplated one piece of land, a ‘watery flat’, that seemed to have natural drainage possibilities —‘it had a visible declivity’; although he allowed that even if he felt it could be reclaimed without ‘difficulty or expense’, these were relative terms.
They made their way towards Dunvegan.
Dismounting on a narrow pathway with a drop of ground on one side, Johnson had a fall, and although ‘he got up immediately without having been hurt’ the journey was wild, hard and fatiguing.
Led the last stretches of the way by a guide using arcane local landmarks, they arrived at Dunvegan Castle in the later afternoon, and Johnson found himself much warmed by the reception.
He did not have to contend with hundreds of tourists.
Today the sounds from the packed car park and souvenir shop must surely drown the water-music of Rorie More's Cascade, the waterfall which the thirteenth Macleod chieftain liked to hear roaring beneath his window before he slept.
Dunvegan Castle stands on the edge of the sea, and looks up along the long narrow Loch Dunvegan to the north-west.
They say that on a clear day you  can see the Isle of Harris.
Lady Macleod received the travellers in ‘a stately dining-room’, fed them and led them into the drawing-room for tea to meet the family.
She made Johnson feel doubly at home, as she had ‘lived many years in England’, therefore he could expect English manners and sense of comfort.
He stayed at Dunvegan for eight nights, from Monday, 13 September, to the morning of Tuesday the 21st, and may even have outstayed his welcome; Johnson more or less refused to leave the comfort of the castle and  applauded the weather's inclemency which kept him and his companions pinned down.
Dunvegan was the headquarters of the clan Macleod; the old castle, a ruin in Johnson's time, dated back to a time of Viking rule.
A little earlier, the famous literary pair would have arrived by boat: the stairs of the land entrance only appeared during the reign of the previous chief.
pennant's Voyage to the Hebrides of 1772 carries an illustration by Moses Griffith which shows the castle almost separated from the land; since then, the approaches have been consolidated around to either side of the eastern, landward façade.
Dunvegan impresses, despite both its grey colour and the obvious architectural tinkerings of the Victorians.
The feudal independence of the clans fascinated Johnson, even leading him into anecdote, deriving from the vendettas of Skye between the Macleods and Macdonalds.
‘Before the reign of James the Fifth, a Highland Laird made a trial of his wife for a certain time, and if she did not please him, he was then at liberty to send her away’— which is exactly what took place when a Macdonald married a Macleod.
The Macleods repaid the slight in vicious irony; the wedding, they said, ‘had been solemnized without a bonfire, but that the separation should be better illuminated’.
Johnson reports this and other gory tales, tongue-in-cheek so firmly you can scarcely see his jaw bulge.
He seems to have spent his time at Dunvegan listening to the winds and the women, and compares the waves off Dunvegan, even in a tempest, unfavourably with those on the coast of Sussex, and again finds no trees.
Dunvegan had a well; the water, Johnson found upon enquiry, was not brackish but hard; Rorie More's drinking-horn held two quarts of liquor, ‘which the heir of Macleod was expected to  swallow at a draught…before he was permitted to bear arms, or could claim a seat among the men’.
When the laird returns after a long absence the shoals of herring fill the sea-loch outside the castle; if a woman departs for the islands opposite, the shoals will desert the Macleods.
Guests came, one pair occasioning a hilarity reported soberly by Johnson.
The laird and his wife from Muck, a small isle to the south, had a difficulty.
He, family name of Maclean, should have been addressed in common with all lairds by his title — thus, Macleod, Laird of Raasay was known as ‘Raasay’, to distinguish him from all other Macleods.
To come from an island called ‘Muck’ presented some problems, on account of the substance in which not to tread, and the animal with whose name in Gaelic it cross-fertilises — the pig.
Therefore, poor Mr Maclean could hardly call himself ‘Pig’ or ‘Ordure’; and he settled for ‘Isle of Muck’.
Johnson, in perhaps a fit of amending courtesy, reflects upon the excellence of ‘Isle of Muck’ as a landlord.
To the people of his little island, two miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide, ‘Isle of Muck’ fetched a tailor from the mainland twice a year and a blacksmith from the Isle of Eigg (Johnson has not so far reflected upon the name of the laird of Eigg).
And Isle of Muck had inoculated his tenants against the smallpox at a cost of two shillings and sixpence per head.
When their journey began, a crucial ingredient consisted in Boswell being able to show Johnson off to the people of Scotland who met him.
And all along the route, beginning at James's Court in Edinburgh, they gathered at Mr James Boswell's invitation to watch the pearls fall from the Great Bear's jaws.
Dunvegan became for Johnson his most successful visit of the Tour so far.
They gave him a good room, and ‘here therefore we settled,’ he said, ‘and did not spoil the present hour with thoughts of departure.’
In his last note on the place he says, ‘At Dunvegan I had tasted lotus and was in danger of forgetting that I was ever to depart.’
Boswell at Dunvegan vacillates between huge enjoyment of his friend's celebrity and performance, and acute discomfort at some of the conversational and social occurrences.
His rendition of the approach journey from Kingsburgh fills in more detail than  Johnson's, with the revealing observation — still visibly understandable — that their guide navigated across the moors much in the same manner as, I suppose, is pursued in the wilds of America, by observing certain marks known only to the inhabitants'.
Boswell should have written fiction.
Where Johnson utters statesmanly reflections, Boswell lets us see the small events —‘we dismounted’— and then captures the detail of their arrival, their welcome by Lady Macleod (the laird's mother, not his wife).
Her son had been detained on his way to Dunvegan, so they lunched in a stately dining-room, and then went to the drawing-room to meet the family.
He shows us Johnson in a delighted state, thrilled because the ‘entertainment here was in so elegant a style, and reminded my fellow-traveller so much of England’.
On the dining-room walls today hang generations of Macleods; Boswell and Johnson were entertained by the 23rd chief, Norman, who did not marry for a decade after the travellers stayed here.
He was nineteen in 1773, and had been tutored at Oxford by George Strahan, a friend of Johnson.
His father, also Norman, who died a year earlier, in 1772, is portrayed in Allan Ramsay's portrait as if he might have been Bonnie Prince Charlie — in wrap-around plaid, curly white wig, a gold-hilted claymore at his left hip, right hand outflung, and he stands in a landscape of rock, sky and water.
His wife, Ann, a Martin from Ross, was the Lady Dunvegan who hosted Dr Johnson.
Next morning, Tuesday, they slept late, and after breakfast they walked in the garden.
The local clergyman called, and two further Macleods, Claggan and Bay, ‘two substantial gentlemen of the clan’, stayed to lunch of venison and wine.
Boswell's father had rendered Lady Macleod of Dunvegan some legal service in a dispute with the laird of Brodie and James basked in the repayment of the compliment.
The host raised an interesting topic —‘the subject of making women do penance in the church for fornication’: Johnson, who does not mention this conversation, uses the word ‘infamy’ and relates sexual morality to laws of property.
‘Consider what importance to society the chastity of women is.
Upon that all the property in the world depends.
We hang a thief for stealing a sheep; but the unchastity of a woman transfers sheep, and farm and all, from the right owner.
I have much more reverence for a common prostitute than a woman who conceals her guilt.’
Neither man reveals whether Lady Macleod took part in this somewhat lubricious conversation.
When Boswell sought to establish a distinction between ‘the licentiousness of a single woman, and that of a married woman’, Johnson intensified his analogy, comparing the loose single woman to a thief, and the randy married woman to a thief who first murders the victim, and says that among women the infection of licentiousness spreads from the single to the married.
Boswell tried to rally by saying that in India there is a distinction, and Johnson put him down hard.
‘Nay, don't give us India.
That puts me in mind of Montesquieu’—; the French philosopher and belle-lettrist whose Persian Letters may have formed the inspiration for Goldsmith's Citizen of the World: both employed the satirical device of having their society scrutinised by visitors from a far-off land.
Johnson claimed that whenever Montesquieu ‘wants to support a strange opinion, he quotes you the practice of Japan or of some other distant country, of which he knows nothing’.
Dinner conversation that evening took in gout, on which a distinctive book had been published some years earlier.
Both Johnson and Lady Macleod found the book wanting, her objection being that the author did not practise what he preached.
This drew from Johnson the observation that what a man does has nothing to do with how he instructs.
‘No man practises so well as he writes.
I have, all my life long, been lying till noon; yet I tell all young men, and tell them with great sincerity, that nobody who does not rise early will ever do any good.’
He reinforces the point by asking Lady MacLeod to consider whether she needed to know the author of every book she read in order to agree with herself its value.
Typically, he summarises aphoristically the question of whether writers lose authority if they are found not to practise what they preach.
‘There is something noble in publishing truth though it condemns one's self.’
Boswell entered the argument.
The gout writer had recommended addressing the ailment with good humour, ‘as if ,’ says Boswell, ‘it were quite in our power to attain it.’
Johnson believed  good humour an acquired quality, one which came with the ageing process, and came of learning to please others rather than the child's instant gratification of pleasing itself.
As the evening progressed the clan gathered, and ‘listened with wonder and pleasure while Dr Johnson harangued’.
Boswell reveals another sliver of his biographical method by complaining of frustration that he cannot take it all down.
Next morning, through the sheets of rain, another glimpse of Scottish eighteenth-century life: the men of the Macleods left the castle early bound for the next large sea-loch south of Dunvegan, Loch Bracadale, to say goodbye to emigrants bound for America.
Johnson and Boswell sauntered through the castle, as they could today, where many of the artefacts are preserved in a museum; they looked at Rorie More's drinking-horn — Boswell's description is clearer than Johnson's —‘a rather large cow's horn, with the mouth of it ornamented with silver curiously carved’.
They saw his bow, and his claymore — which they both spell with a ‘g’, a mispronunciation if the word derives from cliamh mor, the ‘big sword’.
Boswell observes that when the clans were disarmed after Culloden, they used the old broadsword as covers for their buttermilk barrels: ‘a kind of change,’ he says, ‘like beating spears into pruning-hooks’; swords turned sadly into ploughshares.
The pair discussed a book found lying in the dining-room, the works of Sir George Mackenzie, a predecessor of Boswell both at the Scottish Bar and in literature.
Boswell, as he did frequently, used the works of one writer to provoke Johnson into an opinion of another, in this case Edmund Burke.
Burke, a Dublinman, was twenty years younger than Johnson and politically opposite to him, a member of the party Johnson called ‘vile Whigs’.
Yet, as Boswell records in the Life, ‘As Johnson always allowed the extraordinary talents of Mr Burke, so Mr Burke was fully sensible of the wonderful powers of Johnson.’
Repeatedly, their mutual admiration surfaces, and Johnson always found Burke a challenge, always felt it necessary to raise his game in Burke's presence.
Of Burke's politics Johnson believed, as he did of any political opponent, that honesty deserted him when embroiled politically, only to return when engaged conversationally or intellectually.
On this occasion in Dunvegan he repeated his earlier assertion that Burke never made a good joke.
The laird, Macleod, asked Johnson therefore to define ‘the particular excellence of Burke's eloquence’, and Johnson's reply summarises not only Burke, but all men of such gifts, and it hymns education and the acquisition of learning: ‘Copiousness, and fertility of allusion; a power of diversifying his matter, by placing it in various relations.
Burke has great information, and great command of language; though, in my opinion, it has not in every respect the highest elegance.’
On another occasion he described Burke as ‘an extraordinary man.
His stream of mind is perpetual.’
That evening, Johnson's cold was worse, and the Macleods of Dunvegan cosseted him.
He both wore and drank night-caps: the one made of flannel by one of the Macleod ladies, the other a little unaccustomed brandy, which occasioned him to reveal to his hostess why he never drank.
He said he had been unable to take it in moderation, and then, in a long illness, he was forbidden liquor, so when the habit had been broken he never returned to it.
Next morning, Johnson gave a fine performance of talking.
He held the company spellbound (or so Boswell says) with detailed accounts of how to mint coins and how to brew beer.
The impressed Reverend McQueen thought Johnson had somehow done both.
Since patronising behaviour always contains a curious element of innocence, Boswell was inflated with pride, ‘elated by the thought of having been able to entice such a man to this remote part of the world’, and his tongue, thus loosened, flicked out a memorable simile of himself.
‘A ludicrous, yet just image presented itself to my mind, which I expressed to the company.
I compared myself to a dog who has got hold of a large piece of meat, and runs away with it to a corner, where he may devour it  in peace, without any fear of others taking it from him.’
Before the day was over, Boswell would pay for his flush of righteous enthusiasm.
At table that evening, the current Macleod seemed depressed; he was having difficulty with relatives.
Boswell rattled on about the prospect of other travels with Johnson, perhaps to Sweden, where, hoped Boswell, they would see the King.
Johnson said he doubted if the King would speak to them and Colonel Macleod had a go at Jamie: ‘I am sure Mr Boswell would speak to him’— Boswell underlines the pronoun.
‘But seeing me a little disconcerted by his remark, he politely added, ‘and with great propriety’.’
Realising that Macleod had perceived him clearly, Boswell introduces a short apologia pro vita sua, ‘a short defence of that propensity in my disposition’, in which he justifies his pursuit of the great and famous as ‘nothing more than an eagerness to share the society of men distinguished either by their rank or talents’, and calls it a search for knowledge.
Whether Boswell means this sincerely, or as sleight-of-hand to deflect people from calling him a mere snob, must be measured against the remarkable and immortal results of his association with the one man who allowed him to share his company relentlessly.
Boswell walked into another wall that evening.
When the ladies had withdrawn from the dinner-table, a conversation began about the Highlanders and their linen.
Johnson, outlining a preference for vegetable derivatives rather than animal, said, ‘I have often thought, that, if I kept a seraglio, the ladies should all wear linen gowns, or cotton — I mean stuffs made of vegetable substances’ and declared a hatred for silk: ‘you cannot tell when it is clean.’
Boswell burst out laughing and could not stop — the very idea: that Johnson, ‘that majestic teacher of moral and religious wisdom’, should keep a harem, and had often thought of it.
Johnson tore him apart.
Boswell does not tell us what he said, other than that it included ‘a variety of degrading images’.
It must have been a savage attack; Boswell had offended Johnson's pride and held him up to ridicule; now Johnson retaliated with such force that Boswell says, ‘though I can bear such attacks as well as most men, I yet found myself so much the sport of all the  company, that I would gladly expunge from my mind every trace of this severe retort.’
Outside, the rain of Skye beat on.
Boswell's portrait of Johnson at Dunvegan shows an elderly man with the snuffles, easily tired, and happy to savour some of the comforts of home.
In the security of the castle, run under the English training of Lady Macleod, and as long as he could potter from room to room, with the occasional short foray out beneath the weather, Johnson relaxed, and flexed his muscles for his hosts and the other guests who called to see him.
At its best the structure of one of his perorations follows this pattern: he begins with a general statement and summarises it with an accessible example; then he moves to a narrower statement and concludes with a final example taken from everyday life.
On Friday, 17 September, he performed in a series of conversations in which the style of his thought clearly appears, the manner of his arguments, his journey from proposition to summary, thesis, antithesis and synthesis.
They began at lunch with a conversation on cunning.
Johnson related its effectiveness not to the trickery of the practitioner but to the credulity of the recipient: ‘It requires no extraordinary talents to lie and deceive.’
Developing the thought into consideration of wickedness, Johnson's one-two punch summarised the presence and shape of evil within the human spirit, and he returns, if obliquely, to his recurring theme of the difficulty in being good, rather than succumbing to the natural animus all humans share.
Once again he is worth quoting in full; the italics are Boswell's: Johnson's next disquisition arose from a subject brought back by Boswell after a short excursion.
He and the Reverend McQueen set out after breakfast to find the ruins of what McQueen believed had been an ancient pagan temple to the goddess Anaitis.
Boswell's description of the location corresponds with today's scenery: wild heathland has altered little on Skye: ‘The country around is a black dreary moor on all sides, except to the sea-coast, towards which there is a view through a valley…the place itself is green ground, being well drained, by means of a deep glen on each side, in both of which there runs a rivulet with a good quantity of water, forming several cascades which make a considerable appearance and sound.’
Forestry has now been applied to the upper slopes (Johnson would have been pleased), and in sunshine the views of the distant coast sparkle to the north-west.
The waters described by Boswell flow powerfully beneath deep banks reached after a walk of some hundreds of yards from the B886 north of Fairy Bridge.
From a height to the east the land's patterns show more clearly, and the remains of some ancient structure may be discerned in the heather.
When Boswell and McQueen walked out — the site is north-north-east from Dunvegan Castle over very rough, near-impassable ground — they were accompanied by McQueen's servant.
He must have been with them all the time from Corry, to Raasay, to Kingsburgh, to Dunvegan: ‘a fellow quite like a savage’— and they were followed, ‘as colts follow passengers upon a road’, by local lads, barefoot, ragged, lazy and not wholly unmenacing.
McQueen found the ruins, and then claimed to trace the road along which the goddess's statue would have been borne in procession from the temple to the river for the ceremonial washing attributed to worship of Anaitis.
Boswell puts into perspective the size of ancient sites of worship, by assessing the entire site at two acres and the ‘whole extent of the building’ as no larger than ‘an ordinary Highland house’.
After lunch, Boswell, knowing McQueen's passion for the place, introduced the subject of Anaitis.
Johnson questioned the clergyman closely — then, first disagreed with him and finally trumped him.
McQueen relied on the name of the locality, Ainnit, or Annait, to prove, using the traditional antiquarian reliance upon  linguistics, that it had truly been a temple of the goddess.
Johnson extracted from him the English meaning of the Gaelic place-name; it signified a place of, or near, water, conforming, claimed McQueen, to ‘all the descriptions of the temples of that goddess, which were situated near rivers that there might be water to wash the statue’.
Johnson, contradicting him, took him from the particular belief to the general likelihood: from the possibility of a singular holy place to the generic derivation from water: ‘Had it been an accidental name, the similarity between it and Anaitis might have had something in it; but it turns out to be a mere physiological name.’
It could have been, he argued onwards, a fort, or even an early Christian site, or even a pagan place of votive offering, ‘for there is such a  multitude of divinities, to whom it may have been dedicated, that the chance of its being a temple of Anaitis is hardly any thing.
It is like throwing a grain of sand upon the sea-shore to-day, and thinking you may find it to-morrow.’
Did Johnson know Anaitis, sometimes called Anahita, to be the name of a Persian and pan-European goddess associated with water, in the way that Sequanna gave her name to the river Seine?
His dismissal of McQueen's argument contrasts the man of the world with the islander, the widely-read man of learning and classical scholarship with the local pastor who had an amateur interest in the etymology of his own language.
Even when Mr McQueen said that since Asia Minor had been populated by Celts, could not the same religion have come with the Celts to Skye, Johnson defied him, and the point he made remains valid to this day.
He dismissed any such link for lack of proof; for him there was ‘no tracing the connection of ancient nations, but by language; and therefore I am always sorry when any language is lost, because languages are the pedigree of nations.
If you find the same language in distant countries, you may be sure that the inhabitants have been the same people, that is to say, if you find the languages a good deal the same; for a word here and there being the same will not do.’
Before that, Boswell reports two other Johnsonian performances, on portrait painting and the techniques of historians.
On the former Johnson wished for accuracy of representation, by which means the portrait painter also creates a piece of history; on the  latter he applauded developments in which historians had begun to consult and interpret factual record instead of merely culling from other histories.
In the evening Johnson, as he did when in defence of a figure he admired, delivered one of his acutest perceptions.
One of the dinner guests found Pennant, the travel writer, superficial.
Johnson counter-punched, landing three telling blows.
One — that ‘pennant has told us more than perhaps one in ten thousand could have done in the time that he took.’
Two — when the laird complained that Pennant described how rents drained the Highland economies without saying how they should be refurbished, Johnson said, in effect, that Pennant was obliged to report, not to cure; ‘If I tell that many of the Highlanders go bare-footed, I am not obliged to tell how they may get shoes.’
Three, and Johnson's knock-out punch — Pennant's descriptions went as far into detail as Pennant wanted them to, and therefore they should be seen for what they are, not what they might have been: ‘Here is a man six feet high and you are angry because he is not seven.’
Next morning, Saturday, Johnson walked early into Boswell's bedroom ‘to forbid me to mention that this was his birthday’.
He was 64 — and too late: Boswell had already told Lady Macleod, therefore Johnson could not avoid the embarrassment he obviously felt at the prospect of congratulations.
Boswell assumed that Johnson's displeasure at Lady Macleod knowing came ‘from wishing to have nothing particular done on his account’.
We do not know what, if anything, took place celebratorily: neither man mentions gifts, birthday toasts, felicitations, not even from the Macleod children.
As Saturday passed Boswell talked of leaving Dunvegan on the Monday; Johnson said he would not budge until the Wednesday.
Mr McQueen left, heading south in time to preach next morning at Bracadale, and saying he would wait for them at Ullinish.
He and Johnson parted with warm expressions of mutual regard.
In passing, Boswell asked McQueen whether he felt content as a clergyman on Skye, and the reverend man answered — or so Boswell interprets — that much of his satisfaction with his lot derived from his Skye ancestry.
In a rare occurrence, the accounts of Boswell and Johnson overlap on this Saturday, on the matter  of ‘Muck’, the laird thereof.
They share the information about the isle's dimensions, population, inoculation (against smallpox) and services.
Sunday morning at Dunvegan brought the worst weather so far — and the most valuable insight yet into Johnson's influence on Boswell's writing.
Before breakfast he went to Boswell's room ‘to read my Journal, which he has done all along.
He often before said, ‘I take great delight in reading it.’
Today he said, ‘You improve: it grows better and better.’’
Johnson dismissed a compliment-hunt by Boswell, who worried whether he had acquired slovenly habits.
To apply the principles of this meeting, and the crucial facts that its seemingly casual remarks convey —‘which he has done all along’ and ‘it grows better and better’— is to unveil a picture of Johnson, on the road, casting his eye repeatedly over Boswell's entries.
From the knowledge I have acquired so far of Johnson, I cannot imagine him forbearing to make comment, nor can I imagine Boswell not seeking advice and guidance.
Does not this short exchange at Dunvegan account fully for Boswell's never-ending flattery of Johnson?
He knew the Great Bear would see every word.
Yet, credit to Boswell, for all his lapses into near-hagiography, we get a sufficiently rounded picture of Johnson to survey him and to judge.
Sunday's conversation involved the manner in which men choose wives; strange associations with the island of St Kilda; the further travels of Johnson; and a dissertation upon prize-fighting, leading into observations upon combat and duelling.
Memorable among these exchanges: Johnson believed that men choose weak and ignorant women as their wives because they ‘know that women are an over-match for them’; he thought little of poetry he had heard from St Kilda: ‘it must be poor, because they have very few images.’
Boswell countered this critique, suggesting that genius may also reside in the inventive distribution of sparse material.
Johnson: ‘Sir, a man cannot make fire but in proportion as he has fuel.
He cannot coin guineas but in proportion as he has gold.’
On travel, Johnson hoped to go to Italy in 1775.
When the Laird said he preferred Paris, Johnson said there was ‘not a Frenchman of letters now alive he would cross a sea to visit’.
Johnson also read a little— in his room he had works by his erstwhile host Lord Monboddo, and Laurence Sterne's Sermons of Mr Yorick (interestingly, Boswell does not give the full title, merely calling it Sermons, a deference perhaps to the scandal the book had caused when it appeared in 1760).
Johnson even complained a little— or so Boswell suggests — that he was not seeing enough of Boswell: ‘He asked me today, how it happened we were so little together.’
Bozzie blamed the time-consuming Journal.
As happens many times throughout, and frequently in footnotes, one sentence of Boswell's from the after-dinner conversation contains the seeds of a novel — even, potentially, a saga:.
‘We talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange's being sent to St Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief.’
Maddening, such a tantaliser.
Boswell's footnote, even if extensive by his standards, frustrates further.
Lady Grange was unharmoniously married to a Law Lord.
‘For some mysterious reasons, which have never been discovered, she was seized and carried off in the dark, she knew not by whom.’
She did, but Boswell for all the legal and social reasons in the world, could not say, nor could he expand beyond a sketchy account of her long, forlorn imprisonment.
Sir Walter Scott, however, had no such constraints upon him fifty years later, and he had the added advantage of seeing Lady Grange's journal.
Lady Grange's husband had been a Jacobite and during one of their marital battles she hinted that she would expose his seditious leanings — for which he could be hanged.
He, knowing of vindictive blood in her family, got her kidnapped and dumped on St Kilda, where she spent several years, with a waiting-maid for company.
Eventually she escaped, by means of a message for help hidden in a twist of tweed yarn, but she and the Catholic priest who agreed to assist her were both intercepted and imprisoned on another remote island where Lady Grange died.
It is part of the enjoyment of Boswell that again and again he sends his reader's imagination flying, like God, in all directions at once.
Monday, their last day in the Macleod castle, dawned with higher winds.
These abated a little around nine o'clock, and the sun came  out; then it rained again.
At breakfast Johnson reminisced about early days in London, and suddenly, with a surprising ungallantry, disparaged a previous hostess, Lady Macdonald, wife of Sir Alexander from Armadale.
Boswell is careful not to identify her; she is ‘a lady, whose name was mentioned’.
Johnson said she should be sent to St Kilda, that she ‘stood in the way of what was good’; he called her beauty ‘insipid’, and said that a skilful craftsman could cut a better face out of a cabbage.
When the young laird of Dunvegan, Norman Macleod, came down late for breakfast, Johnson ticked him off, saying laziness was worse than toothache: ‘I have been trying to cure my laziness all my life, and could not do it.’
Breakfast over, Johnson returned to one of his favourite themes on the trip — Scotland's economy.
Now that feudalism had collapsed, taking with it the traditional form of power, the great lairds had better make themselves rich, he believed, and land and its development offered the only way forward.
He dismissed commerce: ‘Depend upon it, this rage of trade will destroy itself.
You and I shall not see it; but the time will come when there will be an end of it.
Trade is like gaming.
If a whole company are gamesters, play must cease; for there is nothing to be won.’
If it feels like an extreme observation — and, in parts, not unprescient for the great financial débâcles of the nineteenth and late twentieth centuries — Johnson was also voicing an intellectual's fashionable enquiry into the lastingness of common interest.
He had chosen to see trade as linear rather than circular, upward rather than lateral, egotistical rather than mutual: ‘When all nations are traders, there is nothing to be gained by trade, and it will stop first where it is brought to the greatest perfection.’
Today, Dunvegan means to attract tourists, and the castle museum panders energetically with memorabilia of Bonnie Prince Charlie, including a blond, round lock of his hair, or possibly his wig.
The drinking-horn of Rorie More; his Cascade in the gardens; the means by which attention is drawn to cannon and architecture; the tight directions which the visitor must follow — this is no casual throwing-open for the curious and homageous, this is big business, as at Cawdor, although less kempt.
The literature of the  castle, published by the 29th Laird of Dunvegan, John Macleod of Macleod, makes the business plain: ‘Since the castle was first opened to the public more than forty years ago, the number of visitors has risen from a few hundred to tens of thousands’— many of them Macleod descendants from the New World.
Such developments keep Johnson and Boswell at a further remove, although on the wall of the castle hangs a framed letter in which Johnson, with his attractive spidery writing, gives thanks to his host: ‘The kind treatment which I have found wherever I go makes me leave with some heaviness of heart an island I am not likely to see again…
I hope you will believe me thankful and willing, at which ever distance we may be placed, to show my sense of your kindness by any offices of friendship that may fall within my power.
Lady Macleod and the young ladies have by their hospitality and politeness made an impression on my mind which will not easily be effaced.
Be pleased to tell them that I remember them with great kindness and great respect.
I am, Sir, your most obliged and humble servant.’
Lady Macleod (whose title was a courtesy one) kept serving Johnson tea.
She was wrong about Dunvegan being unsuitable for gardening — she wanted to move to a less rocky place: today it blooms and blows.
The rocks beneath the castle, on account of the form they seem to have in high seas and foam, are called Macleod's Maidens.
Johnson slept in the fairy tower where hangs the Zoffany copy of the Joshua Reynolds portrait in which poor Johnson looks so grumpy.
From his bedroom he could see Macleod's Tables, two flat-topped hills, Healaval Mhor and Healaval Bheag to the south-west.
One last memorable portrait to carry away from Dunvegan: Johnson wore his wig turned inside out as a night-cap, and Lady Macleod said, ‘I have often seen very plain people, but anything as ugly as Dr Johnson with his wig thus stuck on, I never have seen.’

Chapter I
The Early Novels: A Prologue to Experiment
‘Flying reputations can be dangerous’(Brooke-Rose 1977a:132)
The direction the English novel was to take in the post-war era was the subject of much discussion in the late 1950s when Christine Brooke-Rose began her career as a novelist.
But while her novels of this period —The Languages of Love (1957),The Sycamore Tree ,(1958),The Dear Deceit ,(1960), and The Middlemen (1961)— are in many respects typical products of their generation, they raise a number of issues which it was not possible to articulate within the parameters of the contemporary debate.
The novels enjoyed a limited success, but because most novelists were concerned at the time to redefine the relation of the individual to society in terms of changing values, it was all too easy for readers to focus on the social dimension of Brooke-Rose's fiction and to overlook those aspects which can in retrospect be seen to prefigure the problems and techniques of her later work.
This was possible mainly because the capacity for viewing personal identity in terms of language and ‘languages’, which was to become the hallmark of her work from the 1960s onward, is integrated in the early novels into a realist narrative mode.
Thus despite the fact that they exhibit an increasing frustration with the novelistic discourse of the period, her first four novels did not succeed in significantly altering fictional convention.
They are, for the most part, light entertainments enlivened by mysterious foreigners, odd situations and an abundance of documentary detail deftly manipulated to appear at once familiar and slightly absurd or ominous.
The familiarity of their London setting accounted, perhaps, both for their easy assimilation into the literary world and for their contemporary readers' lack of genuine interest in the more esoteric themes they raise.
Reviewers eagerly praised the mild satire of their own territory, delighting in the wit with which Brooke-Rose vividly portrayed its types.
Like a novel about the television industry described in The Middlemen , her early works fall easily into the category of ‘professional joke novels, the lid off the law’(110).
But her characters are just a bit too typical in their social habits, their tastes and their personal dilemmas.
Indeed, when Bernard Bergonzi complains of the uniformity of the novels he is obliged as a reviewer to read, he gives as a sample situation a scenario that could well be based on The Languages of Love : ‘a very sensitive, rather neurotic girl, living in an Earls Court bedsitter and having sexual difficulties’(1979:24).
One of Brooke-Rose's reviewers pin-points the problem: ‘I have the feeling that young married intellectual Chelsea…has been rather overworked, simply because so many of its inhabitants write novels’(Quigly 1958:86).
Despite exotic characters and racy plots, the basic social context of Brooke-Rose's early work was too familiar for it to be deemed truly original.
Yet this is not to say that her contemporaries completely misread her first four novels, nor that they misjudged their merits.
With hindsight it is easy to see in an author's uneven early work the later masterpieces struggling to get out, and it is especially tempting to do this with an author such as Christine Brooke-Rose whose fiction underwent such a dramatic change between 1961 and 1964.
But it would be an oversimplification to argue that her chosen ‘content’ simply did not find an adequate ‘form’until the mid-1960s.
A more likely explanation is that Brooke-Rose was flattered by her own wit and allowed it to determine her style of narration.
In 1977 she published an autobiographical sketch entitled ‘Self-Confrontation and the Writer’ in which she posits her authorial identity as a separate person whom she calls ‘John’.
She criticizes John for having accepted too readily the standards of the day and for having adapted too easily to the social and literary context in which he found himself:
The rat race.
The mousetrap in the House of Fame or Fiction.
John is eager to please.
John is also easy to please.
John is built by the House.
Flying reputations can be dangerous.
…John and I, flattered at first by the sweet smell of success, had to get out of it, into another language, forgotten in the House of Fame but happy ever after in the House of Fiction.
(1977a:132)
‘Flying planes can be dangerous’ is the type-sentence of semantic ambiguity because it can yield both a passive and an active interpretation, and here a variation is used to demonstrate the danger of paying too much attention to public opinion.
The writer may seem to be actively creating, whereas in fact he or she is being passively fashioned by the public's desires, ‘built by the House’ of fame.
There is no ambiguity, however, about the distinction between the ‘House of Fame’ and the ‘House of Fiction’.
Brooke-Rose's division of fiction into two classes reflects a tendency prevalent among those writing about the 1950s to group its novelists into two categories.
Stephen Spender divides writers into ‘contemporaries’ and ‘moderns’(1962:555); Malcolm Bradbury distinguishes between the main current of fiction and peripheral but nevertheless important work by people like Samuel Beckett, Malcolm Lowry, William Golding, and Lawrence Durrell (1973); and Iris Murdoch draws a distinction between the ‘journalistic’and the ‘crystalline’which delineates similar categories.
(1961:27).
Each such polarization invariably reflects the values of the writers who impose it, but there is a wide consensus among critics who have written about the literature of the period that the majority of it is unambitious, anti-experimental and somewhat lacking in originality.
Even those such as David Lodge and Malcolm Bradbury who argue against this blanket judgment do not attempt to depict the decade as one of great creative achievement.
They readjust the picture to admit a counter-current of more radical authors or point to the less dramatic use of ‘experimental’ and ‘modernist’techniques in the novels of mainstream fiction (Bradbury 1973:177–7, 1977:18–20, 1987:106–11; Lodge 1971:9–34).
Certainly the fifties was remarkable for the self-assuredness with which writers defended what they saw as a fresh start for English literature, and for the equally unanimous revision this view underwent not ten years later.
There was a strong sense at the time that the novel needed an agenda.
The label ‘Angry Young Men’, a term originally used to describe John Osborne's Look Back in Anger , was extended to the first novels of Kingsley Amis, John Wain, and Colin Wilson.
Soon it came to include John Braine, David Storey, Alan Sillitoe, William Cooper, Stan Barstow, and even, for some, Iris Murdoch.
The experience of these writers was seen as emblematic of the increased social mobility that characterized post-war Britain.
Their fiction was considered significant because it succeeded in expressing this new experience.
While it was generally recognized that the new novelists drew a great deal on their eighteenth and nineteenth century predecessors, this was regarded not as a fault but, on the contrary, all the more reason for admitting them as new bearers of the old standard (Hansford Johnson 1949:235–3, Wilson 1958:viii).
The sense of reaction against pre-war social institutions was strong.
In the absence of a moral or social common ground which writers could assume with their audience, the hero as existentialist outsider proved a useful way of taking a critical stand without explicitly defending any given system or ideology.
Angus Wilson's Hemlock and After (1952), John Wain's Hurry On Down (1953), Kingsley Amis's Lucky Jim (1954), Iris Murdoch's Under the Net (1954), John Braine's Room at the Top (1957), Alan Sillitoe's Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (1958), and David Storey's This Sporting Life (1960) are all first novels in which a lone male protagonist tries to find a means of accommodating himself to a society whose main institutions he views with suspicion.
The consequent soul-searching often includes as much self-mockery as it does social criticism, and for this reason it is not subversive.
On the one hand it is evident that the old order is collapsing of its own accord, so any attempt to subvert it would be pointless; and on the other, none of these authors portrays a main character secure enough in his own moral beliefs to propose them as a new global framework.
This meant that while criticism was encouraged — often in the form of parody or satire -, innovation was kept to a minimum.
The strength of the critical consensus that reigned in the mid-fifties was undoubtedly one of the reasons why Brooke-Rose's first novels took the form they did.
The pressure to please must have been especially strong for women writers who, if they wrote novels of ideas, were in danger of either being rejected as over-cerebral or having the intellectual content of their work ignored.
Women writers are less likely to identify with the existential plight of the lone male, but even so, a willingness to conform to the narrative conventions of realism is evident in the fiction of a number of writers who are now viewed as innovative.
Doris Lessing, for example, began publishing in the 1950s, but did not question the appropriateness of the realist mode to her conceptual concerns until the 1960s.
Other women writers were read in such a way as to assimilate them to reigning categories.
Ivy Compton-Burnett, whose elegantly minimal and stylized dialogue has similarities with the narrative technique of Nathalie Sarraute, was appreciated in the 1950s primarily for her wit in portraying the viciousness of social interaction rather than for the techniques she employed.
Both these phenomena come into play in Brooke-Rose's case.
It is indicative of the pressure to conform to gender-coded standards that The Dear Deceit , the most serious and most personal of her first four novels, has as its protagonist a lone male suffering from an identity crisis over his patronym.
In the other three novels frothy dialogue and sparkling wit tend to overshadow the deeper philosophical issues at stake.
John Hall describes the early novels as:
competent enough vignettes of the witty, intelligent circles in which one might expect to discover Miss Iris Murdoch, and their end result was not far removed from the sum of of [sic ]the parts of Miss Murdoch's own elegant conundrums.
One could not help feeling that the authoress was an awfully clever gel, insofar as she could manipulate quite adequately the basic framework of the nineteenth-century novel of manners.
(1976:183)
Iris Murdoch's fiction represents perhaps what Christine Brooke-Rose was aiming at, not in philosophical or even aesthetic terms, but as narratives which combine readability and lively story-telling with intellectual themes.
Brooke-Rose used her facility for light, clever story-telling as a sort of sugar-coating with which to induce readers to swallow her less palatable conceptual material, but in most cases the pill was never digested because readers were accustomed to ‘serious’ novels being concerned with morality.
Unlike many of the writers of the period, Brooke-Rose is not overly preoccupied by morality in her early fiction.
For a period in the 1950s she flirted with Roman Catholicism, and whether her Catholic point of view made her see moral issues exclusively within a religious framework, or whether she simply did not share the same experience as English-born-and-raised writers who faced the dissolution of their class system is difficult to judge.
Nevertheless, this is a point on which her novels defy easy assimilation to those of Iris Murdoch or Angus Wilson, with whom she has also been compared.
The lightness and wit of Brooke-Rose's novels do, however, invite comparison with those of Muriel Spark.
Like Brooke-Rose, Spark began writing fiction as a form of therapy after a period of psychological strain (Stanford 1963:62).
Both writers are primarily interested in the ontological and epistemological questions raised by the Catholic view of God, and both found in nervous tension a justification for modest technical experimentation as well as a tool for exploring aspects of reality which would otherwise have been difficult to treat outside the context of philosophical discourse.
Brooke-Rose's first four novels also share with Spark's work an effort to integrate intellectual pursuits with questions of self-definition.
Integration proves problematic in Brooke-Rose's novels; there is a growing sense of the impossibility of conveying ideas through a unified realist character without seriously jeopardizing his or her psychological autonomy and integrity.
This is indicative of a more general dissatisfaction with the conventions of the realist novel which takes character as its focal point, and Brooke-Rose's disenchantment with realism began to be apparent in other ways as well.
The Dear Deceit represents a questioning of the causal logic of narrative and the literary heritage which provided both her and her readers with a whole set of ready-made narrative assumptions.
The Middlemen , for its part, denounces the incestuous and parasitical world of literary journalism in terms that far exceed gentle mockery.
The project of integration with which Brooke-Rose began provided sufficient material for ‘four average, competent novels’(Brooke-Rose 1977a:134), but it also led to a frustration with available formal strategies which prepared the way for the radical change in direction her oeuvre was to take with Out in 1964.
The following discussion will trace the development of this dissatisfaction.
The early novels will be analysed in relation both to Brooke-Rose's conceptual concerns during this period and to the fictional conventions through which she chose to figure them.
1.1 The Languages of Love: The Word Made Fresh.
The Languages of Love seeks in Catholicism a solution to the problem of linguistic, psychological, and intellectual dividedness.
The goal on each of these three planes is unity, and, appropriately, the novel takes as its framework the multi-layered but harmonious structure of medieval allegory.
The manipulation and decontextualization of language is presented as a temptation to be overcome but a necessary step on the way to achieving mastery of the ‘languages’ of intellect and spirit.
Thus, despite its ultimate rejection of the playful linguistic transgressions so characteristic of Brooke-Rose's later fiction, her first novel inaugurates the underlying discursive vision of her entire oeuvre : intellect and psyche are understood in terms of the various conceptual ‘languages’ that pertain to them, and personal identity is established as a product of their interaction.
The conflict between actively fashioning language and allowing oneself to be constructed by conventional systems is provisionally resolved by valorizing submissiveness as Christian humility, but present are the basic elements of a dilemma which is to remain with Brooke-Rose for several decades.
The novel is a tale of apprenticeship about a young woman called Julia who, like her creator, has just completed a Ph.D.
in medieval studies and is living in London.
Julia is trying to discover who she is and what she is cut out to do.
She faces two choices, one personal and the other professional.
On the personal front she has to choose between her one-time fiancé Paul whom she loves but cannot marry because he is Catholic and she is divorced, and Bernard, a fellow philologist who attracts her physically but is selfish, emotionally dishonest, and married.
Julia also has to decide between a scholarly career as a university lecturer and that of a ‘lady novelist’.
In both cases the choice is between the serious but dull (when seeing Paul she had been completing her thesis on religious poetry) and the creative but frivolous (she collaborates with Bernard on a book about adultery in medieval literature).
In the end she opts for the serious, renounces carnal love, and decides to become a Catholic.
Ironically, by writing the novel Christine Brooke-Rose pursued the opposite route and made her début as a ‘lady novelist’.
Yet neither her choice nor Julia's is as one-sided as it seems.
Brooke-Rose resumed her scholarly work when she finished the novel, and Julia realizes in the end that while the ‘frivolous’ path precludes the ‘serious’, the latter can provide a means of channelling her creative energies.
Likewise, her divinely inspired love can be extended to both Paul and Bernard.
What is initially posed as a choice between two mutually exclusive alternatives becomes that between the exclusion of serious values and the inclusion of the best of both worlds.
This development is framed in the context of discursive initiation: Julia's education in natural languages is paralleled and supplemented by an éducation sentimentale in ‘languages’ of a higher order.
The novel closes with a recognition of linguistic competence: ‘Julia had learnt the languages of love’(239), and it is significant that these ‘languages’ are plural.
In the penultimate scene Julia and Paul decide that the summer during which the action of the novel has taken place has been like ‘an allegorical dream-vision’(212).
As in medieval allegory, multiple layers of meaning correspond to the novel's multiple languages.
The novel charts an apprenticeship in ‘languages’ on each of three levels: philological, romantic, and religious.
On each level alternatives are transformed into compatible aspects of an all-inclusive Christian discourse which absorbs differences into a higher unity.
When it first appeared,The Languages of Love was generally read as a satire of London literary and academic circles, but it was criticized by reviewers for not being satiric enough (Cranston 1957:90, Allen 1957:470).
Others attacked it for not being sufficiently realistic (TLS 1957:629, Fuller 1957:62), and one concluded that ‘Miss Brooke-Rose was in two minds about the novel she intended to write’(Allen 1957:469).
As the medieval allegory is not among the categories into which reviewers are accustomed to fitting witty first novels by women, it is not surprising that the multi-level approach should have been attributed to indecisiveness on the part of its author.
At the start of the novel Julia sees philology as a lifeless and uncreative pursuit.
When she complains of the drudgery of studying sound changes, Bernard hints that she does not really have what it takes to be a scholar.
Her main problem in both academic and social contexts is that she is not sure enough of herself to be able to assert her point of view in an idiom which is both personal and appropriate.
Her position with regard to the discourse of Catholicism is likewise that of an outsider.
When she argues with the canon law, Paul explains that ‘Religion isn't something one needs….
Nor is love.
They simply are ’, but he gives up trying to make her understand because they don't ‘talk the same language’(43).
Both philology and Catholicism are here presented as ‘languages’ which Julia is unable to master because she wants to question them and change them rather than accept their inherent systematicity.
To overcome her insecurity she resorts to escapist fantasy and linguistically transgressive wit.
In her viva her examiner asks her if she does not think that ‘dipthongisation in fourteenth century Kentish may have been optional’, and her immediate reaction is that ‘The question made no sense at all’.
In fact her resistance to the ‘sense’ of the question is due to the fact that she understands it first in the context of legal discourse: ‘She had a brief glimpse of a mediaeval bureaucrat…issuing a proclamation: ‘From 23.59 on the 16th April 1340, dipthongisation will be optional in the County of Kent’' (5).
This opening sequence establishes a paradigm of fictionalization that operates throughout Brooke-Rose's work: a fictional situation is generated out of a semantic slip caused by switching from one discourse to another on the strength of a word or a phrase.
In her later novels Brooke-Rose uses techniques such as these to integrate different discourses, but in The Languages of Love linguistic transgression signals a lack of honesty and integrity.
Julia uses wit as a means of deflecting the topic of conversation away from serious issues by shifting the referent of a scholarly discussion to the more immediate social situation:
‘Of course,’ he was saying, ‘there was no future in the Indo-European period.’
‘And yet,’ she replied, refusing to be serious, ‘here we are.
(31)
Punning is the occult logic of language best left aside by those concerned to grasp its evolution.
As Jonathan Culler points out, the pun is to the synchronic dimension of language what etymology is to the diachronic dimension (1988:2), and Julia plays on this parallel by confusing the two.
She quips to Bernard: ‘I find the change of meaning much more interesting….
It has changed and not changed: hatred is after all most annoying and cognisance is a very quaint affair’(14).
Bernard is fond of punning as well, but whereas Julia uses her verbal skill to compensate for her discursive incompetence in philology, Bernard uses his in order to evade emotional seriousness.
Because his refusal to be sincere about his feelings toward her leads her further away from her own values, she begins to resent the way in which he constantly gives her the linguistic slip: ‘Concepts which still meant much to her, by which she had once lived, were swerved aside with a smart epigram, a pun, a quotation, a dirty story’(170).
Bernard's emotional dishonesty is seen in terms of his ability to split language, which is a product of his psychological duplicity:
[Julia:]‘You can skit over anything, can't you?’
His eyes flickered as he looked at her, and she knew he was searching his mind for a joke.
‘Don't worry, I skit ever so phrenic.’
She winced.…
his own humour was mere flippancy, emphasising the very division within himself which he condemned in others.
(146–7)
Puns and similar manoeuvres trivialize the serious and instil in Julia a sense of linguistic mauvaise foi .
She watches her values slowly being eroded, and she describes the process of moral degradation in terms of language: ‘You find yourself giving in on little things, twisting words and meanings, always trying to be one-up on whoever you're with, and then suddenly you give in on something else, much bigger’(131–2).
In religious terms punning is indicative of sin: the covert substitution of one meaning for another by a linguistic sleight of hand is practised by Milton's Adam and Eve after the Fall, indicating that they have sundered the prelapsarian unity of divine order.
But even in her fallen state, Julia recognizes that there is another, morally superior form of linguistic play which combines creative vitality with genuine understanding: ‘The true humour of life, Julia thought, should illuminate, not shut out, its essential melancholy, its macabre elements, and its fleeting moments of unbelievable elation’(147).
She experiences this unbelievable elation for the first time during a discussion of phonetic laws with Professor Jarvis-Andersen.
Julia admits that she resents linguistic laws just as she resents the canon law of the Church: ‘I'm interested in language as a process, not a thing or an essence.
Phonetic laws are useful, I know, but they aren't fixed laws, like the laws of nature’(66).
The professor replies that in reality language ‘is in a constant state of flux, there are no real boundaries or unified communities, and mingling continues through supra-political or social bonds’(67).
This view of language brings philology to life for Julia; she suddenly sees its object as the product of individual creativity.
The spontaneity of metaphoric innovation in the speech of the professor's children leads her to the revelation that words once thought of as ‘the bare bones of language’ are actually alive with flesh.
She rises to a metaphoric euphoria and discovers her vocation:
Even phonology seemed worth while now, whispering the sounds of time into the very material that poets used, the vowels jealously mutating, angrily fracturing as consonant groups shifted to their conditioned cues in wild adenoidal ecstasies.
The flesh and bones of words rose again to the salvation of their etymologies.
And the job he was telling her about seemed interesting and desirable.
(69)
This experience prefigures Julia's recognition at the end of the novel that the laws of the Church are also a way of describing spiritual harmony.
The path to salvation is eventually shown her by the unwitting Messiah figure Hussein, an East African poet who speaks in metaphors and proverbs.
He has been forced to leave England and to abandon Georgina, the woman he loves.
Hussein tells Julia, ‘I have waited for my boat five weeks.
And every day of those five weeks has been a knife slowly twisting in a wound.
It is not better now’(205).
His honest suffering reveals to her the nobility of selfless love and the truth of language which is metaphoric yet direct.
Shortly after this episode Julia decides to become a Catholic.
She makes peace with Paul, accepts a job as a lecturer in philology and finally succeeds in establishing genuine communication with Bernard.
She realizes that she is as yet too selfish to be truly creative and puts off her artistic endeavours for the time being so that she can first learn the more humble task of interpretation.
She recognizes the fact that she loves both Paul and Bernard, but transposes this love onto the plane of the sacred and finds herself released from sexual desire.
The pun as a rhetorical motif of both dialogue and narrative gives way to utterances with multiple layers of meaning: I'm sorry, I'm very sorry.’
She sat up and repeated it, hypnotised by the double meaning' (221); Bless you, Georgina,’ said Julia, with at least three different levels of meaning in her tone' (232).
Harmony reigns over disparity in this new world vision, and a multi-faceted language has been found in which to express it.
In many ways the plot of The Languages of Love is similar to that of Iris Murdoch's The Bell (1958).
In both novels the heroine undertakes a search for her identity that requires her to navigate between the attractions of two men who represent two different attitudes to life.
In the end the woman chooses to renounce both men and sets out on her own path.
But in terms of technique,The Languages of Love resembles Murdoch's first novel,Under the Net (1954), in which learned discourses are interpolated by means of dialogue.
Brooke-Rose's attempt to integrate the creative and the scholarly seems, as one reviewer remarks, ‘a shade voulu ’(Wyndham 1957:491), a problem which haunts Murdoch's work as well.
The questions raised by conceptual material are discussed by the main characters and illustrated in their actions, but in neither case do they affect the plot structure itself which marks a return to formal strategies of the past:Under the Net to the picaresque tradition, and The Languages of Love to the paradigmatic plot of fall and salvation in which rhetorical devices remain subservient to the basic three-tiered design of Christian allegory.
In Brooke-Rose's later work this relationship is reversed as linguistic felicities are allowed to pierce through the layers of the harmonious hierarchical structure of narrative ontology; rather than replacing pun with metaphor, Brooke-Rose transforms the one into the other.
In ‘Self-Confrontation and the Writer’ she describes her life as a series of ‘splits’, and the allegorical mapping of language to identity hinted at in The Languages of Love is elaborated:
John is a whole language.
He has as many selves as he has utterances, virtual or realized, as many selves as there are words in his lexicon, even in the dictionary of his potential language, with each word its aetimology, its phoneyetic fragility and its semiantic sea changes, each word its infinite contiguities and its tall spokes of paradismatic possibilities.
(1977a:129)
The creative vitality that Julia seeks in the ‘dry bones of language’ is here achieved through textual manipulation of the type she rejects as indicative of a fallen state.
Its salvation twenty years later attests to the dramatic shift in Brooke-Rose's values, her style, and her approach to narrative problems, but her propensity to see personal identity and social interaction in terms of language is nevertheless firmly established in her first novel.
1.2 The Sycamore Tree: Reality and the Character of Realism.
What The Languages of Love phrases in terms of language,The Sycamore Tree (1958) figures in ontological terms.
The problem of split identity is exacerbated, and again the goal of the main characters is to find a way of healing the divisions between intellect and psyche.
Catholicism is presented as a potential remedy, but the philosophy of indeterminacy appears for the first time in this novel as a rival discourse.
Though Catholicism is championed in the end, it is no longer portrayed as having the power to protect one from the extremes of madness and sin.
Doubt as to the efficacy of religion as a solution to fragmentation is implicit in the novel's ambiguous ending.
This is paralleled on the technical plane by a sabotage of the verisimilitude on which realism is predicated.
The novel launches a covert attack against the ontology of the fictional character which becomes less the representation of an individual in search of his or her ‘true’ personality than an agent for conveying impulses or ideas beyond conscious control.
The hero, Gael Jackson, is a novelist and philosophy don at Oxford who specializes in theories of perception.
He lives in Chelsea with his wife Nina, a fashion columnist and devout mother of three.
The story opens with Gael facing a libel suit for his latest novel in which he has unwittingly described the literary hack Howard Cutting.
The basic situation of The Sycamore Tree is the same as that of The Languages of Love .
Nina adores her saintly husband but lusts after the sordid Howard.
In both novels the solution to the problem the heroine faces is harmony through love, yet the outcome is considerably less satisfying in The Sycamore Tree because it entails renunciation of life itself.
While Nina has the same protean tendencies as Julia, they are exaggerated to the point where they become dangerous.
Like Julia, Nina is eager to please and dissipates her personality in those around her.
When she does finally succumb to Howard's advances, her identity crumbles into its component parts.
She is vulgar and crude with Howard, soft and kittenish with Gael, ‘She had, in fact, become two persons’(153).
Unable to suppress his anger any longer, Gael lectures her on adultery's ‘disintegrating splitting effect on the inner personality’(219).
Nina eventually has a nervous breakdown, but after a brief stay in hospital she returns to Gael.
Marital harmony is provisionally achieved when Nina resolves to behave, and Gael forgives her.
The novel is brought to its dramatic conclusion by the playing out of yet another case of split identity.
Howard's wife is having an affair with an exiled Hungarian student called Zoltan Torday who is writing a book on the adamantly nationalist Hungarian poet Arpad Szendrey.
Zoltan meets Gael by ‘coincidence’, recognizes in him a fellow soul, and seeks Gael out when his problems become too much for him.
He reveals that in fact he is Szendrey, but that he has had to change his name in order to escape persecution by the Communists.
He had given up writing poetry and had been living the duplicitous life of a critic deciphering his own works, but when he fell in love with Howard's wife Elizabeth his former self was reawakened and he ceased to believe in his own existence.
Gael sympathizes, for he experiences similar losses of personality, yet he can do little to protect Zoltan.
A number of unlikely events orchestrated through telepathy lead to the dénouement in which Zoltan shoots and fatally wounds Nina, then kills himself as well.
Before Nina dies she and Gael again make peace, she repents her sins, and Gael vows to rewrite his novel.
The critical consensus about The Sycamore Tree was that it is good when it is light and witty but that it ‘sinks under a mass of elaboration’(Allen 1958:500), and that Brooke-Rose's effort to add depth to her characters succeeded only in getting them ‘thoroughly bogged down’(TLS 1958:557).
Brooke-Rose was generally thought to have overdone the serious aspect of her tale to the detriment of its comic potential.
The discontent voiced by reviewers appears to focus on the implausibility of the novel's plot and on the incongruity of the unsettling elements in it.
This tension may have caused its failure in the eyes of contemporary readers, but it is also the sign of a change which was taking place in Brooke-Rose's attitude toward fiction.
Like the novel we read, Gael's novel of the same name is a ‘philosophic fantasy’(9), but it appears to be even less realistic than its real-life double; it is described as a disquisition on the nature of reality with characters that flit in and out of existence.
The sycamore tree of the title is a reference to a version of the famous limerick by Ronald Knox which encapsulates George Berkeley's immaterialism.
Gael, who is not religious, holds only with the first half of the double limerick according to which existence depends on being the object of another's perception.
For him the tree is therefore a symbol of ontological indeterminacy.
Gael's highly ‘unrealistic’ belief accords with his tenuous grasp on the reality of his own existence.
But as both Howard and Nina inform us, the Latin name for the tree is acer pseudo-platanus , meaning ‘pseudo plane tree’.
On her death-bed the Catholic Nina contrasts its illegitimacy with the ‘real’ sycamore in the Bible.
For Nina this is symbolic of the ‘pseudo’ or illusory nature of life on earth, as compared to the reality of the sacred realm beyond.
The intermittent, flickering reality that obsesses Gael is, from the Catholic perspective, itself but a delusion.
Gael is the ‘good’ character, and Nina the weak, struggling, sinning one.
Yet, as in Graham Greene's Brighton Rock , the fallen Catholic is in the end somehow right, and the virtuous atheist less so, for if Gael's concept of the soul represents a higher spiritual plane and poetic vision, it also is coupled with neurosis, prescience, and telepathic powers which verge on the absurd.
The ability to communicate extra-sensorily can be seen as a sort of literary emblem of that which is fundamentally beyond expression.
Gael develops this line of thought; he believes that ‘the perceiving self — that basic identity which philosophers have defined as a mere sequence of impressions accumulated by memory — is in fact the human soul, not the mind’(212).
Yet when this principle is realized in the literal terms of premonitions and mental telepathy, he baulks and feels that he must be going mad.
The graphic illustration of these concepts reveals that in fact they entail a spiritual agency which he refuses to accept, and this is the inner contradiction in his professed theory of reality.
Gael believes in a Christian ontology but rejects its necessary corollary, God.
Though his theories of perception ‘made him slip so easily into a feeling that nothing around him existed, or alternatively that he did not exist in anything around him’(66), he dismisses his own supernatural powers as coincidence until they become too overwhelming to be ignored.
In a sense his experience supports his theory, but also mocks it, for the ability to perceive what is happening in London when you are in Oxford is not true spiritual knowledge.
It is a parodic version of perception through the soul, a form of pseudo-knowledge.
True knowledge and true understanding, it is implied, can only come from a divine source.
As in Muriel Spark's The Comforters (1957), telepathic experiences are employed in The Sycamore Tree to figure a divine presence with a sense of humour, and like Spark, Brooke-Rose breaches the conventions of realism in order to demonstrate a Christian doctrine.
Gael has rejected God as a guarantor of reality, but he is being used, despite himself, as an oracular figure through whom the knowledge of other characters may be conveyed.
The use of characters as oracles for beliefs they do not themselves espouse in effect divides the character's identity from his or her narrative function.
Hussein in The Languages of Love is a Muslim, yet it is he who reveals to Julia the beauty of genuine love expressed in honest language which leads her to convert to Catholicism.
Gael is even more forcibly spoken through, and he himself does not regain his lapsed faith.
Similarly, the narrator's persistent burrowing into the unarticulated zones of her characters' stores of knowledge about themselves indicates a certain disregard for their psychological integrity, a hollowing out of their ‘roundness’.
They begin to become mouthpieces for an outside force, be it divine will, the necessities of plot, or authorial comment.
In this sense they are revealed to have only intermittent existence.
As Nina remarks, this is a condition which afflicts Gael's novel as well, and since it has the same title as the novel we read, comparison is inevitable.
Brooke-Rose's novel implicitly presents itself as a ‘pseudo’ or partial version of the ‘reality’beyond.
But the mapping of this fictional-real opposition onto the worldly-divine dichotomy raises a number of questions as to the status and role of fictional constructs, given that we have access here and now to this world alone.
Only in later novels does Brooke-Rose draw out the implications of this parallel (i.e. the ‘fictionality’ or ‘constructedness’of lived experience), but by pushing the possibility of psychological and ontological wholeness into ever more distant territory in The Sycamore Tree , she demonstrates a growing scepticism with regard to the possibility of achieving it.
In narrative terms this is reflected as a disregard for verisimilitude and the use of characters as discursive instances through which a number of different discourses can be made to pass rather than as representations of discrete individuals.
It is symptomatic of this subtle shift that at the end of The Sycamore Tree the Catholic dies, whereas the novelist lives to rewrite his text.
The simulacrum within a simulacrum is what survives, though its status as a ‘pseudo’ reality has been recognized.
The same could be said of Brooke-Rose's attitude toward fiction.
The pretence of representing lived reality begins its slow death at this point in her oeuvre .
From here on her novels become increasingly aware of their own status as constructs or models through which ‘reality’ is necessarily mediated.
1.3 The Dear Deceit: Truth and Narrative.
In The Dear Deceit (1960) the dichotomy between truth and fiction hinted at in The Sycamore Tree is brought to the fore, and the possibility of reaching a pre-discursive reality is relinquished once and for all.
An increased consciousness of conceptual systems as necessary fictions accompanies a growing awareness of the conventions of narrative.
By subverting the causal, linear logic of the traditional story, the novel emphasizes the fictionality inherent in any attempt to present the individual as a coherent whole.
In many respects The Dear Deceit is a summing up of Brooke-Rose's first two novels.
It combines the transgression of narrative convention that begins to be manifest in The Sycamore Tree with a variation on the technique of recontextualization through linguistic slips employed in The Languages of Love .
The main question the novel poses is how we know, remember or invent the past.
Philip Hayley, the main character of the novel, undertakes an excavation of the life of his charlatan father, around whose numerous exploits that the plot revolves.
Alfred Northbrook Hayley was a self-dramatizing, duplicitous thief who spent his life trying to convince people of his importance by adopting a series of false identities.
When Philip tries to unravel truth from fiction, the task proves too much for him.
In the end he realizes that the only way truly to understand his father is to become him; he presents the evidence he has collected as a reconstruction of his father's actions, thought processes, and emotions.
But in order not to repeat his father's duplicity he uses self-consciousness and temporal manipulation to keep the artificiality of this procedure in view.
The tale the novel recounts is told backwards: after the first two chapters, each successive episode takes place further in the past.
Philip's project is both a search for the truth and an act of self-distortion, a ‘sane insanity, that wilful entering into some reality other than one's own, by way of learning, searching, inventing, dreaming and becoming’(40).
Philip claims that this is a domain as yet unexplored by psychoanalysis, and he suggests that possibly this is just as well: ‘Some call it truth, some creation, some fiction, history, memory or mere jingling of bells.
Perhaps all these are one, beyond analysis’(40).
This ‘sane insanity’ through which one enters into someone's personality — intentionally splitting oneself into both searching, inventing subject and the object of the search — is posed as the very condition of narration.
But narration is seen in The Dear Deceit as the original and persistent obstacle to ‘truth’ because the process of constructing a story inevitably leads to falsification.
Philip meditates on the narrative representation of action: ‘Strange how the reality of the past comes to our mind most immediately as fiction.
Some even say that all our knowledge of the past is fiction’(29).
This is both the ‘dear deceit’ which goes back centuries and the curse peculiar to modern-day society.
In an article published in 1959 on what she calls ‘signpost language’, Christine Brooke-Rose points out that the ‘language’ of film is composed of clichés which are the product of the technical exigencies of the medium.
She gives the following example:
A man is lying on his bed, smoking.
Or he can't sleep and lights up nervously.
On the bedside table is an ashtray with several cigarettes stubbed out almost unsmoked.
After a few quick puffs the man turns and stubs out this cigarette too, three-quarters wasted.
Then he gets up and paces the room.
(1959a:45)
Her comment is that this scene demonstrates the underlying dishonesty of the cliché:
…the cliché is not necessarily just something banal, in the sense that it occurs frequently, though it is that too: a cliché is a convenient falsification.
…The whole scene is in fact a kind of shorthand, since the film cannot take ten real minutes to show someone smoking a cigarette to the last, which is the more natural behaviour of a worried man trying to think out a problem.
…But of course realism can't be that realistic.
The wasteful smoker is part of film terminology, it says ‘he is worried — action will follow’.
(45)
The danger is that the convenient falsification will begin to manipulate reality:
If something completely or partly false, however innocuous, can be shown as real for so many years, then anything false can be shown as real, and be believed….
I wouldn't be surprised to learn that many people do now smoke only a quarter of their cigarettes on the bed when worried, simply because they have seen it so often in films.
(46)
Brooke-Rose complains that this type of facile cliché has invaded the novel as well, and that though ‘younger writers are fed up , and want to ‘go straight’ ' this is no longer possible because ‘the currency has been devalued’(48).
Through novels, films, and the press ‘signpost language’ exerts a determining effect on our minds.
It provides paradigms of action and role models through which we interpret ‘real life’.
The Dear Deceit explores the consequences of our immersion in this type of fictional convention.
Philip becomes aware of the process through which we invent our own identities based on the fictional paradigms at our disposal.
Our application of these ready-made stories and stereotypes to our lives may not be particularly apt, but the web of intertextual concepts which forms the substrata of our experience nevertheless plays an inescapable role in our lives.
Though he professes scorn for the outmoded quaintness of things Victorian, Philip's conception of life is modelled largely on the Victorian novel and its Edwardian successors.
He says that when he first learned that his father had been in prison he expected the crime to be something on a grand scale, something melodramatic, like murder, something novelistic, like ruining in bankruptcy thousands of trusting small investors, as the Town & County Bank had done in Cranford , or Mr. Frothingham in The Whirlpool or Ponderovo [sic ]in Tono -Bungay .
(29)
His narrative expectations are, of course, frustrated, but they demonstrate the source of the norms ingrained in his mind.
In all three of these novels the ‘crimes’ are those committed by basically good people who, through no real fault of their own (other than the speculative instinct that is the mainstay of the capitalist system), have been caught up in bank failures for which they valiantly accept responsibility.
Hayley's crimes are petty and dishonourable, a contrast which reveals the falsity of the narrative assumptions Philip makes.
Since Philip realizes that it will be impossible to do away with the artifice of narration if he wants to present the results of his search, he decides instead to make the artifice obvious.
In this way he forces the reader to go through the same process of retrospective illumination that he himself has undergone.
Despite reviewers' complaints to the contrary, the structure of the novel does not preclude suspense entirely; rather it shifts the object of suspense from the result to the cause.
We trace Alfred's life back in order to find the origin of his dishonesty, but along the way we come across many peculiar situations before we know what brought them about.
There is a curious phenomenon of hermeneutic delay: much of what we read consists either of illumination of the enigmas of a preceding chapter, or new enigmas.
The consequence of this is that we are constantly hypothesizing about the possible significance of each event, and often discovering that we are wrong.
The novel's early readers were understandably annoyed at having their narrative expectations constantly thwarted.
They attacked the regressive structure as ‘disconcerting and tiring’(TLS 1960:673), and called it a misuse of the author's talents (Hartley 1961:74).
But in fact Brooke-Rose was learning to re-use her talents to new ends, one of which was precisely the readerly frustration that reviewers complained of.
As readers, we too imagine causes and motivations which are based on analogies we draw with other novels and other narratives.
It is continually suggested to us, however, that ‘reality’ is not in fact like novels we have read, that it is mundane and pitiful.
We are kept reading by the promise of an original sin or trauma that will justify — either in psychological or moral terms — the very existence of the story, but stripped of the successive identities he has built up over the years, Philip's father is revealed as no more than an insecure, over-imaginative little boy.
We then realize that there is no dramatic originary event or ‘cause’ which would lend significance to all that has preceded it.
Our desire to discover one is in the end all that is revealed.
Though our passive acceptance of causal logic and narrative clichés is the novel's main target, it also plays with the related theme of linguistic laziness.
Philip implicitly dismisses the value of his own reflections on the ugliness of modern London with off-hand self-ironizing comments which imply that he too is a product of the intellectual dissipation he criticizes: ‘Life, I said with startling originality as I stepped out of the bus in my mackintosh, is like that’(307).
Philip is ironic also about his tendency to think in terms of‘higher’ literature, and he discredits the validity of a quotation from Eliot, when it comes into his mind, simply on the grounds that he has been too corrupted by contemporary culture for anything that occurs to him spontaneously to have lasting value:
There was some later affidavit of my mother's, which gave her date of birth, Geneva 1893, the date of her marriage in 1919, the date of his death in 1934.
At once I waved away the unjustly famous quotation which sprang with great obviousness to my mind.
When lines of poetry spring spontaneously to the mind of a lawyer, I thought, they have surely ceased to be true.
Life holds more than birth, copulation and death.
(31)
It is doubly ironic that Philip's sense of intellectual and spiritual degradation is in fact very like Eliot's, and his life risks being as impoverished and as meaningless as Sweeney's minimalist ‘brass tacks’ scenario.
Allusions to other texts frequently undergo this same process of depreciation.
From the title onward, quotations are abundant in the novel, yet they are often either inappropriate or irrelevant.
A superficial similarity, such as the occurrence of an individual word, will trigger a literary reference which has no bearing on the situation at hand.
Alfred's lawyer twists allusions in this way:
It was indeed a sad thing that in these days when the Church had enough enemies outside it should divide itself into hostile forces, because, he added aptly, forgetting the original subject of the quotation, a house divided against itself could not stand.
(260)
An exchange between two monks includes a similarly ironic misquotation:
‘He ain't got no more vocation in him than a blind sparrow, that's what.’
‘Fear not therefore: better are ye than many sparrows,’ Brother Cuthbert quoted pointlessly. (245)
People's propensity to misjudge the context of a reference is an indication of their willingness to assimilate the situations they encounter to paradigms of thought and action with which they are familiar, however misleading or falsifying this process of assimilation might be.
Like the ‘language’ of narrative, the ‘language’of literature serves as a source of stereotypes and models which provide ready-made explanations and prevent people from analysing the specificity of the world around them.
In the 1960s and 1970s Brooke-Rose rediscovered the recycling of our cultural heritage condemned in The Dear Deceit as a form of parodic interrogation.
Like the pun in The Languages of Love and the concept of a variable reality in The Sycamore Tree , a discursive practice that is devalued and stigmatized in this novel is later used as a tool for exploring the practices and attitudes it represents.
What is in the early novels seen as a lower-order truth or a fallen state is saved, or at least salvaged, as the very possibility of any higher order truth becomes increasingly remote.
Though the technique employed in The Dear Deceit represents a laying-bare of traditional narrative devices without offering an alternative approach, it sets the stage for the more radical break with the conventions of realism which Brooke-Rose's fiction demonstrated four years later.
1.4 The Middlemen: Splits with(in) Convention.
The Languages of Love ,The Sycamore Tree , and The Dear Deceit all portray characters who are defined by their roles as interpreters or carriers of information.
In each case the fact of being spoken through entails a splitting of identity and a threat to psychological stability.
In The Middlemen (1961) this mediatory role is magnified so as to become the primary focus of the novel.
The individual psyche is irrevocably shattered by being exteriorized in two separate people: the cool, cerebral psychoanalyst Serena, and her passionate, turbulent twin sister Stella.
The schema is evident also on a formal level in the breakdown of traditional narrative techniques.
Brooke-Rose's evident exasperation with her chosen genre is manifest in the exaggeration of convention to the point of parody.
This discursive attack is paralleled by a scathing social critique.
Subtitled ‘A Satire’, the novel is a bitter, pessimistic work in which the ominous subcurrents of Brooke-Rose's earlier novels are seen in their most threatening light, and the gradual disintegration to which she had subjected the traditional realist novel in her three previous works is brought to an explosive climax.
The Middlemen focuses on Serena and the ‘sprawling ant-heap of middlemen’(5) that swarms around her.
Like Evelyn Waugh's pre-war novels, it collects a large cast of lightly-drawn characters, many of whom have appeared in Brooke-Rose's earlier fiction.
The novel opens with the combustion of seven housewives who have fallen victim to the latent flammability of the most recent invention of United Volcanic Industries (manufacturers of synthetic fabrics from volcanic ash).
The efforts of Rusty Conway, Chief Public Relations Officer at U.V.I., to minimize the publicity caused by this event get him entangled in the competing empires of television and the press.
A loosely constructed plot evolves fitfully around the activities of Rusty, Serena, her husband Rupert, and Stella.
Serena is torn between her sisterly love and her annoyance with Stella's aggressive insecurity.
The two have an argument and vow never to speak to each other again, whereupon Serena leaves for a holiday with Rupert on a volcanic island in the Aegean to which Rusty and his wife have recently been transferred.
While visiting the local volcano, Serena is profoundly upset by the sight of hardened lava fields around a bubbling centre, and this causes her to have a nervous breakdown.
The next day they are all killed when the volcano erupts unexpectedly.
The novel ends with Stella,en route to a new job and ignorant of her sister's death, flicking absent-mindedly through a news magazine featuring the tragedy.
The novel was not well received.
It was condemned for its ‘two-dimensional characters’(Mayne 1961:316), lack of ‘moral passion’(Bergonzi 1961:297), lack of profundity (Price 1961:332), ‘misanthropic spleen’, and smugness (Hope 1961:1486).
In many respects these are accurate characterizations.
The Middlemen is uneven and less well-written than Brooke-Rose's earlier novels.
Light satire of people's habits contrasts sharply with the severe social criticism with which the text is larded.
Narratorial frustration is evident in the disjointed structure of the novel which focuses briefly on a number of subcultures of professional London without bothering to link them in more than a cursory manner.
The realist technique of localizing narratorial comment in the subconscious of a character is also frequently exaggerated.
The novel opens with a page-long diatribe about the age of middlemen which appears to be the opinion of a third-person narrator but is subsequently identified as ‘disloyal thoughts…not precisely verbalised as they turmoiled through the hazily discontented soul of Rusty Conway’(5–6).
The obvious artificiality of this device is jarring, and the half-hearted attempt to ‘subjectify’ a large chunk of sociological analysis soon gives way to more overt narratorial commentary in the same vein.
The impression received is that Brooke-Rose had simply given up trying to integrate the conceptual content of her novel with its story.
The didactic message of The Middlemen is presented in two long passages which together represent an attack on the phenomenon of ‘middlemanship’.
The gist of the argument is that, once a relatively restricted and disreputable segment of society, the ‘class’ of middlemen has grown proportionally larger until now ‘We are all middlemen, selling to others something we do not own, something we have not made’(5).
When the principal exemplars of this class are dramatically eliminated the message is clear: middlemanship destroys from within, and the act of passing something on without truly changing or improving it is psychologically nullifying.
There is an evident parallel between Brooke-Rose's vitriolic attack on this social system and her disenchantment with the realist novel.
The realist novel plays the role of ‘middleman’ by passing on a world-view which is as ‘faithful’as possible to perceived reality, but is in fact a clichéd falsification.
There appears to be no other solution than either to conform to the system or to destroy it.
If The Middlemen nominally conforms to the generic conventions of satire, it symbolically destroys the type of world in which these conventions are operative.
The central relationship in the novel between Serena and Stella is emblematic of the contrast between adaptation to convention and rebellion.
As her name indicates, Serena prides herself on being under control.
She claims to have understood and resolved all her own hidden desires, and she spends her life doing so for others: she is a ‘modern middleman between body and soul, a perfect salesman of the unconscious to the conscious’(33).
Like the wares of other middlemen, there is something synthetic and not quite genuine about her product, for it enables people to survive within a basically debilitating system.
Her patients receive ‘fresh personalities, refashioned at least to fit the coming decade, if not perhaps exactly in the style intended by the original designer’(33).
The only aspect of Serena's life that is beyond her control is her sister Stella.
Stella is a wild card both in the deepest recesses of Serena's own mind and in the domain of middlemen, for Stella is the only character in the novel who is exempt from this status: ‘Stella was in effect her own middleman, alone in the world, selling her personality, and very badly’(30).
She represents the turbulence that Serena is unable to eliminate from her life, the residue of chaos that Serena cannot refashion to fit her world.
Whereas Serena is concerned to domesticate her problems, Stella consciously strives to exaggerate her own eccentricity, yet her resilience and the regularity of her yo-yo-like existence testify to an underlying solidity.
She is the life force of the novel which survives the destruction which the world of middlemen brings upon itself.
But for all their differences, Stella and Serena are the two halves of a basically unsatisfactory character.
When Serena reads an article on the plane to Greece about a pair of Siamese twins, one of whom dies, she realizes that she and Stella are like Siamese twins joined at the psyche (40).
The same thoughts pass through their minds and they are both aware of their deep ties to each other.
When Serena dies, leaving Stella behind, it is as if the dominance of control and stability has come to an end.
What is left is not an altogether agreeable person.
Stella is self-dramatizing like Alfred Hayley, frivolous and insecure like Nina Jackson, and her company is more distasteful than that of any previously encountered character in Brooke-Rose's fiction.
She is the inverted product of a world against which she is continually defining herself, Brooke-Rose's final, desperate attempt to present a ‘character’ in the traditional realist sense.
With The Middlemen Christine Brooke-Rose effectively eradicates the London literary scene from her work.
In so doing she destroys the principle of control that kept her novels within the bounds of the generic traditions of British fiction.
When Serena's hidden emotions break through the surface of her calm, it is as if the collective unconscious of an entire society were erupting.
The novel's apocalyptic ending takes on a universal dimension by being implicitly compared to a nuclear holocaust.
Rusty, who has done some research on the island, assures his companions that the volcano is safe.
He explains that the last eruption was a slow drawn-out affair lasting six years ‘just like the last war’(207).
Just like the next war, the new eruption is sudden and its effects immediate.
The Middlemen can thus be seen as both an acid criticism of British society and a purge of Brooke-Rose's oeuvre .
By killing off the stable element of the fictional character, she abandons a realist notion of the individual identity and the narrative norms which subtend it, freeing the way for a concept of subjectivity and a form of writing in which these factors do not come into play.
There are, however, hints in The Middlemen of the modes of narration which are to replace what is so brutally disposed of at the end of the tale.
Rusty Conway becomes one of Serena's patients because he has had a spell of extreme absent-mindedness which made him incapable of carrying out his work.
Shortly before the fateful journey to Greece he begins to be overcome once again by the same sensation.
He is unable to concentrate on forms and reports because the words he reads undergo illicit manipulations that, like the pun, involve slippage and linguistic re-synthesis:
For some weeks now, Rusty had been in that peculiarly unreal state when words leap out from pages, voices or one's own thoughts, and rudely rattle their bones about, or shove their meanings under one's nose like exhibitionists until the meanings themselves vanish in a dance of death.
Cinderella mutated from rinsedella to rinse-a-leader and denser-liar, nitron became non-try, even trianon, U.V.I. kept changing into I-view-you, and synthetic fibre had long completed its various transitions from fetid cider to fist ethic neighbour and finally to thigh fetish sabre, where it looked like getting stuck for quite some time.
(178)
The linguistic acrobatics these words perform in Rusty's mind and the various interpretations which might be attributed to the results are of less consequence in and of themselves than the fact that this performance demonstrates verbal operations of a logic other than that attributed to the rational mind.
We see the seeds of alternative patterns of thought also in The Sycamore Tree when Nina temporarily loses her mind:
I must get a grip on my mind.
I must…my mind…
I dropped it…somewhere…slipping…my mind is a slipped disc, a dropped womb…
I must…get a grip…
I lost something…
I dropped it outside…in the street…walking…on the Embankment…
I dropped it in the river — flowing…flowing back…under the bridge…the Bar…daddy…he's gone…he's in disgrace, debarred.
Debarred from the bar…no…debarred from a barmaid…mummy…he's gone…he lost something…(221)
The images that go through Alfred Hayley's mind in the minutes before he dies follow similar patterns, but in all three cases the discursive deviation is localized and explained within the novel as a product of the suspension of reason.
While the transgression of narrative conventions manifest in Brooke-Rose's first four novels indicate a frustration with realist fiction, realism demonstrates a remarkable capacity for assimilating such deviations.
It is only through the radical reconception of language use prefigured here that she is able truly to break with the traditional novel.
There is no doubt that the transformation in style and approach which took place with Out in 1964 represents a fundamental reconception of the novel on Brooke-Rose's part, but the technical and conceptual development which took place over the course of her early fiction points the way to the change to come.
The gradual breakdown of personal identity and the growing dissatisfaction with the conventions of realist fiction which are the most striking features of her first four works laid the ground for a thorough overhaul of fictional technique.
What were at the time perceived as the faults of these novels can in retrospect be read as indications of the inadequacy of contemporary narrative models to Brooke-Rose's needs as a writer.
Chapter II
Out, Such, and Between: Metaphor and the Languages of Knowledge
‘there are moments when I feel I'm on the frontier of something and I must twist language in some way to pass the frontier’(Brooke-Rose 1990e:31)
As I suggested in chapter one, Christine Brooke-Rose's first four novels constitute a conceptual prologue to her later work, but because they fail to break with the assumptions of the conventional novel, they are unable adequately to articulate the relation of individual identity to language.
In the novels which followed, manipulation of language is discovered to be the key to the integration of intellect and psyche which is unsuccessfully sought throughout her early fiction.
The main concern of Out (1964),Such (1966), and Between (1968) is the process whereby the subject constructs his or her identity in and through the language of specialized discourses, and the way in which he or she acts on those discourses to make them ‘run here and there again'.
Metaphor is the dominant structuring mechanism of the novels, stylized transcription of consciousness their fictional mode.
Unlike the straightforward narrative approach of Brooke-Rose's earlier work, this new technique allows the discourses of knowledge to be integrated into the language of the text at the level of syntax and lexis.
The focusing device of this chapter will be the role of metaphor in the novels as a strategy for bringing specialized discourses to bear on the consciousness of the fictional character and for ‘mobilizing’ the discourses themselves.
Before undertaking an analysis of the novels, it will therefore be necessary to investigate in more detail what is meant by the term ‘metaphor’.
I shall examine its status in relation both to Brooke-Rose's own formulation of the ‘grammar’ of poetic metaphor and to several other current conceptions of the figure.
Brooke-Rose sees in all her novels starting with Out ‘the same principle of interweaving [that]can create metaphors or unexpected meaning’(1988a:137).
Though she tries to ‘wrap this linguistic experimentation in some sort of narrative situation — a minimal mimetic plot’, her real purpose is ‘to explode human discourse’(137).
She accomplishes this linguistic manipulation or ‘explosion’ by combining words in such a way as to make them ‘activate’one another.
In an interview she gave in 1974 she explained that the goal of her fiction was to re-activate the language of conceptual knowledge through metaphor:
language is capable of far more subtle ways of metaphoric expression than the stock grammatical ways.
…You use the same phrase in a new context and embedded in that new context it acquires a completely different meaning.
What I like doing, what interests me particularly, is the fusion of different discourses.
(1976k:3)
Metaphor operates in her fiction as a structural principle; it provides the means of bringing two or more disparate fields of knowledge into a relation which organizes thoughts and events.
In her doctoral dissertation and later in A Grammar of Metaphor , Brooke-Rose studies the mechanics of metaphoric interaction from a grammatical point of view.
She develops a typology according to the different parts of speech, and her analyses reveal a marked preference for the verb metaphor.
Of all grammatical types, the verb metaphor displays the greatest amount of interanimation.
It ‘is more dynamic, not in the sense that it expresses movement (which a noun can also express) but because it creates more activity between the words of the sentence in which it is used’(1955a:75).
The verb metaphor is further characterized by the fact that it has no direct link to its proper term, but acts on the noun of which it is the predicate; in the case of the transitive verb it can also act on its direct and indirect objects.
She borrows Geoffrey of Vinsauf's example ‘the meadows laugh’, and comments that while ‘laugh’ may be interpreted as ‘are full of flowers’, this interpretation ‘is not stated, nor is it necessary to guess it….
The picture of the meadows laughing is immediate’(1958a:208).
In A Grammar of Metaphor she is at pains to show that in English poetry the relation of the verb metaphor to its proper term is weak and less important than its relation to its subject and objects: ‘when a verb is metaphoric, its adaptability to the noun is so great that its relationship to it is direct, and much stronger than its relationship to the action it is ‘replacing’ ' (1958a:209).
The consequence of this immediacy is a greater degree of autonomy for the figure:
The verb metaphor is accepted as a complete action in direct relation to the object to which it is applied, while the noun metaphor tends to be divided within itself into proper and figurative terms.
It is chiefly the noun metaphor which has caused philosophers and estheticians to worry so greatly about the relationship of these two terms and the basis on which they are compared.
(1955a:77)
As she observes in this passage, her approach contests traditional assumptions about metaphor, assumptions that have often gone unquestioned by more recent theorists of rhetoric.
First, it demonstrates that the majority of types of metaphor (if not a statistical majority of metaphorical utterances) do not operate on the basis of replacement, but contain both ‘proper’ and ‘metaphoric’terms in praesentia (1958a:23–5).
Second, it stresses the importance of the immediate context of the poem over the distinction between ‘metaphoric’ and ‘proper’, in that it analyses the pre-referential dynamic of the metaphoric process.
Finally, it shows that a given term may, as in the case of the verb, engage simultaneously in a number of different metaphoric relations.
Like Brooke-Rose, Jacques Derrida (1972b:277–8) and Paul Ricoeur (1975:19–24) trace the bias toward noun-based views of metaphor back to Aristotle's classification, but neither investigates the implications of an alternative view based on a different part of speech.
It must be noted, however, that Brooke-Rose's own conception of metaphor is not tied fast to rigorous distinctions between the parts of speech, and that grammatical categories often get blurred in her discussions.
She is concerned less with syntactic definitions than with the role a word plays in the metaphoric process.
She states in an initial survey of the various theories of metaphor that those of most philosophers are of little interest to her because they treat metaphor from the point of view of its semantic content, ignoring the way it functions linguistically (1955a:45, 1958a:15).
While this is no longer true today, her grammatical analysis of metaphor is highly original, and its implications have yet to be fully recognized.
It is nevertheless worth examining some more recent theories to see if they can suggest ways in which the implications of Brooke-Rose's approach might be applied to novelistic texts.
Recent thinking on metaphor has been greatly influenced by Nietzsche who recognized that the process of dividing up experience into discrete domains was one of ‘coagulation’(1979:86), the construction of a discursive system on the ‘running water’(85) of metaphor.
According to this view, conceptualization necessarily involves a dissimulation both of the differences between perceptual stimuli and of the metaphoric nature of knowledge itself.
This is then a double process of immobilization which can only be remobilized by art.
Rhetoricians ancient and modern have noted that the word ‘metaphor’ comes from the Greek word metaphorein , meaning to transfer or to carry over, and the idea of transport or mobilization inherent in its original meaning has played a significant role in the conceptual evolution of the figure.
As Genette remarks in the title essay of Figures , all figural language opens up a topos ; it adds a dimension to discourse, turning a line into a space (1966:210).
The work of metaphor then involves the transfer of meaning across that space, from one site to another.
Meaning, as the most simple and most common conception has it, is displaced from one word onto another.
This model has long since been embellished, however, by the Anglo-American followers of I. A. Richards.
For Richards, metaphor involves ‘a transaction between contexts’(1936:94) in which meaning is ‘smuggled in’(1925:240) from one semantic domain to another by a ‘vehicle’(1936:96).
There is something ‘semi-surreptitious’(1925:240) about this process, as if the boundaries of semantic propriety were somehow being violated.
Metaphor is no mere tourist in a foreign land, it is a bootlegger.
Paul de Man is even more explicit in his formulation of this notion:
We have no way of defining, of policing, the boundaries that separate the name of one entity from the name of another; tropes are not just travellers, they tend to be smugglers and probably smugglers of stolen goods at that.
(1979:17)
It is no coincidence that, as Barthes reminds us, rhetoric was born of a property dispute (1970a:90).
The establishment of proper boundaries is clearly at issue in the use of linguistic structures that have the capacity to found a noman's land between proper meanings and bounded territories, creating a zone of ambiguity.
For Nelson Goodman a single instance of contraband becomes a mass invasion.
Goodman describes metaphor as ‘no mere distribution of family goods but…an expedition abroad.
A whole set of alternative labels, a whole apparatus of organization, takes over a new territory’(1969:73).
Here an innocent ‘expedition’ suddenly becomes a conquest from one sentence to the next.
Like the theories Brooke-Rose criticizes in 1958, this view conceives of metaphor in terms of semantic property to be fought over and captured.
Max Black's influential ‘interaction’ theory builds on Richards's ideas and depicts metaphor as a complex operation in which one semantic field ‘organizes’another, acting as a ‘screen’or a ‘network of lines’(1962:41) which ‘filters and transforms’(42) in order to project onto the proper term an entire ‘system of ‘associated commonplaces’' (41).
It seems that this dynamic view is closer to what Brooke-Rose has in mind when she describes her use of metaphor in the novels as recontextualization through the fusion of discourses.
In his discussion of the metaphor ‘man is a wolf’, Black describes the work of metaphor in discursive terms: ‘Any human traits that can without undue strain be talked about in ‘wolf-language’ will be rendered prominent, and any that cannot will be pushed into the background' (41).
He even hints that there may be a reciprocal relationship between the metaphoric and proper components of his schema.
Though he does not develop the notion, he admits that if the metaphor ‘man is a wolf’ restructures the attributes of ‘man’to bring out his lupine characteristics, it also ‘makes the wolf seem more human than he otherwise would’(44).
But while Black's argument for the reciprocity of metaphor is of great interest, it is not clear how seriously we are meant to take it.
The primary force at work is clearly the one-way effect of lupinization.
The value of Black's theory lies in the fact that it allows for a conception of metaphor as the interaction between two discourses, but like Goodman's concept of imperial appropriation, it has overtones of subjugation.
One might wonder why metaphor so often demands that its work be described in terms of colonization and occupation, and what it is about an initial transportation of meaning that turns it into a conquest or a coercive restructuring.
Perhaps the answer lies in the duplicity of metaphor's ancient role as an element in the art of both pleasing and public persuasion.
Although largely neglected today, this latter function is unashamedly manipulative.
Coercion may well be an inherent part of the metaphoric process, but we may nevertheless ask whether it might not be possible to imagine a different type of metaphor, one that was truly interactive in a positive sense.
The recent trend toward cognitive approaches to metaphor provides a means of formalizing such a conception.
The work of Eva Kittay is particularly helpful in this respect.
Kittay offers a ‘perspectival’ theory that expands upon Black's ‘interaction’view.
The importance of Kittay's formulation lies in her wide definition of the type of linguistic unit that can be labelled metaphoric.
Metaphor has traditionally been taken to be a one-word device, or at most a figure of several words strung together, whereas Brooke-Rose's analyses concentrate instead on metaphor's work at the level of the phrase or sentence.
Black too extends its necessary semantic field to the unit of the sentence, claiming that the semantic force of a metaphor can only be measured with regard to its context.
Kittay agrees with his argument but questions the validity of stopping with the sentence which, as a semantic unit, is as arbitrary as any other.
For her, any unit of discourse can be used as the ‘frame’ of a metaphor, the only constraint being that the corresponding metaphoric ‘focus’must be a unit at a level beneath that of the frame.
Thus if the frame is a sentence, the focus can be a single word, if the frame is a larger unit of text, the focus can be a sentence (1987:64–8).
With Brooke-Rose's use of metaphor in mind, we can extend this logic and hypothesize that if the frame were an entire discursive system, the focus could be one discourse within that system.
Though this notion of what I shall be calling ‘discursive metaphor’ may seem itself to be metaphoric, it is, as we shall see, a justified extension of the standard definition, as it accounts for the distinct use of figurality in Brooke-Rose's fiction.
While Kittay's theory has the advantage that it allows metaphor to be seen as operating according to the same basic principles regardless of the size of the discursive unit in question, Brooke-Rose's own examination of the mechanisms of the verb metaphor suggest a view that minimizes dependence on an implicit ‘proper’ term outside the text and emphasizes the metaphoric interactions between the terms themselves.
According to this view the space opened by figural language is not that between metaphoric and proper terms, but that between two or more equally figural terms, which, in Brooke-Rose's case, are two or more discourses.
Furthermore, if we take seriously Black's claim that his specimen metaphor ‘man is a wolf’ serves at once to render man wolf-like and to humanize wolves, a reversible metaphor could be imagined at the level of a word, a sentence, or a discourse in which each term was engaged in a metaphoric interaction with one or a number of other terms, organizing them, structuring them and in turn being structured by them.
This is a situation in which multi-directional migration supersedes conquest as the mode in which metaphor is best understood.
The possibilities of employing one discourse as a metaphor for another are first explored in Out .
Out reveals the coercive aspect of the colonizing use of metaphor and stages subversive counter-strategies which undermine this use.
Such focuses on a use of discursive metaphor which represents an alternative to the coercive model manifest in Out .
Finally in Between the multiple, reversible metaphor is put into play.
In all three novels the construction of personal identity is intimately associated with metaphor's work at the level of discourse.
Each novel presents a main character in a situation in which he or she is in some way alienated.
In Out and Such this alienation is psychological and social, while in Between it is the cultural alienation of being in a foreign country.
In each case the experience of being wrenched out of the familiar instigates an identity crisis which results in a series of ‘rebirths’ as the protagonist grapples with the problem of selfhood and strives to construct some form of coherent identity out of the scraps of other peoples' languages which penetrate his or her consciousness.
In using Brooke-Rose's discussion of poetic metaphor as the basis for an analysis of how this figure works in novels she wrote in the 1960s, I am not suggesting that there is a necessary relation, historical or logical, between them.
I am simply arguing that Brooke-Rose's analyses point toward her later use of what she herself describes as ‘metaphor’ at the level of discourse.
A Grammar of Metaphor does not, by itself, constitute a theory of metaphor, and I have therefore had to rely on theories developed by philosophers and literary critics, while indicating where these fail to account for the aspects of Brooke-Rose's writing that seem most interesting.
I have tried to show that these are the very points at which her own analyses of the figure prove useful.
2.1 Out: Coercion and Subversion.
Christine Brooke-Rose describes her use of metaphor as a literalization (1976k:3).
This may seem confusing if it is not made clear what she means by ‘literal’.
She explains in a recent description of her fiction that ‘any specialist discourse when transposed into a non-specialist context or, if you prefer, when understood literally, can turn into metaphor’(1988a:129).
According to this definition, literalization is a metaphoric mapping of what Barthes calls an ‘acratic’ or specialized discourse onto an ‘encratic’or universal one.
Barthes is careful to point out that though the encratic discourse posits itself as natural, in fact this is an illusion, a necessary camouflage of its own systematicity (1984:128–9).
Only if it is made strange or different do we see it for what it really is.
Out is a prime example of this technique.
In revealing the coercive nature of the discursive mechanisms of a fictitious future society, it illuminates the relationship between a dominant metaphor and the individual language-user.
Brooke-Rose here succeeds in solving the problems encountered in her earlier novels with the integration of ‘form’ and ‘content’by demonstrating that metaphor is a powerful cognitive tool with specific social uses.
Out takes place at an unspecified time several decades after the unexplained but presumably cataclysmic event known as the ‘displacement’.
The anonymous, pronoun-less protagonist is a ‘colourless’ man who divides his time between the shack where he lives with his wife and the Labour Exchange where he goes in search of employment.
During the course of the novel we witness the progressive worsening of his psychological and physical condition.
He works for a time as a gardener on the estate of the rich Mrs Mgulu, and later as a construction worker in her house.
But because of his deteriorating health, he is unable to keep any of these jobs long, and throughout much of the novel he is confined to his shack where his wife cares for him.
As in Orwell's 1984 , a geopolitical realignment has segmented the earth into previously non-existent countries: Afro-Eurasia, Sino-America, and Chinese Europe.
The names of the new countries reflect a reversal in race roles which has taken place since the ‘displacement’.
The colourless races have a tendency to succumb to ‘the malady’ which afflicts the protagonist.
This is a sickness akin to radiation poisoning which causes a high rate of ‘chemical mutation’ and makes the colourless an unreliable source of labour.
The Melanesian races are immune to ‘the malady’ and have therefore grown powerful.
The technological innovations which have developed as a result of society's need to adapt to new conditions have been accompanied by a new epistemology.
The ‘displacement’ has been both a demographic and a cognitive recentring, a ‘displacement from cause to effect’(117/119,118/120,172/174).
As part of this cognitive revolution, psychoanalytic machines called ‘psychoscopes’ have been invented to generate ‘biograms’, ‘the extracted absolute of your unconscious patterns throughout your life…telescoped in time into one line that shows your harmonious rhythm, your up and down tendencies’(147/149).
The biogram renders human memory obsolete, for it ‘telescopes’ the old-fashioned diachronic conception of identity into a fixed form accessible in the present.
Memory has become restricted and suffers from cultural prohibition.
While it is admitted that the past exists, the quest for origins or causes is considered a symptom of disease.
The motto of the new era is ‘diagnosis prognosticates aetiology’, a phrase which is repeated by members of the ruling races in such varied contexts that it becomes evident that no one really bothers to think about it.
It functions as a ‘master metaphor’, the encapsulation of an ideology which structures all domains of thought:
[doctor:]—…diagnosis merely prognosticates aetiology…
The rule is universal in all fields.
It is a scientific law.
[protagonist:]— An article of faith.
— Until disproved.
In the meantime, we are content to know how the thing functions.
— What thing?— Anything.
Society.
Life.
The universe.
God.
The unconscious.
A land-reclaimer. (167/169)
As described by one character, this catch-all phrase is ‘a short way of saying that they don't claim to find either the ultimate cause or the ultimate cure, but they do know exactly how it functions, and can prescribe accordingly’(149/151).
The phrase has been taken from the acratic discourse of medicine and literalized, universalized as an encratic discourse or system of belief.
This discourse is, in a very real sense, an instrument of observation, an organizing tool, or as Out would have it, a ‘conventional weapon’(61/63,74/76,128/130,184/186,196/198).
In ‘Dynamic Gradients’ Brooke-Rose remarks: ‘it has become a truism that, in submicroscopic terms, the object observed is affected by the instrument observing it — part of the famous principle of uncertainty’(1965a:93).
Indeed, ‘diagnosis prognosticates aetiology’ is a rephrasing of this ‘truism’in scientific jargon.
But what appears to be an admission of radical subjectivity can, as Out demonstrates, also lead to subjugation, for if the power of observation to alter its object is harnessed for the benefit of those in possession of the tools of observation, these tools become weapons of cognitive control.
When the protagonist goes for ‘psychoscopy’, we are given an illustration in concrete terms of how the diagnostic tools of this society condition their object:
I am your doctor, father, God.
I build you up.
I know everything about you.
Your profile is coming up very clearly indeed on the oscillograph, and the profile provokes its own continuation, did you know that, the profile moulds you as it oscillates?
Diagnosis provokes its own cause, did you know that?
To put it more succinctly, diagnosis prognosticates aetiology. (136–8/138–9)
The discourse of ‘diagnosis’ represents a coercive use of metaphor in that its aim is to replicate itself faithfully in the conceptual idiolect of all people.
But in the minds of the sick it suffers a mutation: the lens becomes a prism, it refracts and splinters the uniform vision of the ideal interracial society.
Occupied by its clichés, its principles, and its strategies, the sick mind of the central colourless figure unwittingly deploys subversive discursive counter-strategies that turn these ‘conventional weapons’ back on themselves and expose them for what they are.
In the Nietzschean view, only art has the power to reawaken dead metaphors and to shake the rigid structures of abstraction, or as Brooke-Rose would have it, to make discourses ‘run here and there again'.
It is thus appropriate that she should begin her enterprise in Out with an investigation of that originary metaphor described by Nietzsche, the act of perception.
The opening paragraph of the novel poses the problem of the animate and the inanimate in terms of mobility:
A fly straddles another fly on the faded denim stretched over the knee.
Sooner or later, the knee will have to make a move, but now it is immobilised by the two flies, the lower of which is so still that it seems dead.
The fly on top is on the contrary quite agitated, jerking tremendously, then convulsively, putting out its left foreleg to whip, or maybe to stroke some sort of reaction out of the fly beneath, which, however, remains so still that it seems dead.
(9/11)
This image of copulation serves as a linguistic act of ‘insemination’ which initiates a period of gestation and provokes a reference to giving birth toward the end of the chapter.
In an imagined interview at the Labour Exchange, the protagonist claims that he has only been ‘spasmodically in labour’, then immediately corrects himself by rephrasing the slip as ‘employed intermittently’(19/21).
If traditional metaphor brings together two semantic fields by means of a similarity of signifieds, then the pun does the same by virtue of a homonymy or similarity of signifiers.
Discursive ‘slips’ such as this create metaphors which play on the identity of signifiers to highlight the multiplicity of signification and its discourse-dependence.
They serve as prisms or refracting lenses which multiply meaning.
Semantic mobility of this type is the crime that has caused artists to be banished from the society portrayed in Out (149–50/151–2), for the stability of a discourse depends on both its univocality and its universality.
The possibility that a word might have a different meaning in another context threatens to relativize the ‘master metaphor’ on which this society is grounded.
As the novel progresses, the central consciousness is increasingly alienated from the institutions which seek to maintain him under their control, and his own discourse becomes more and more transgressive.
Whereas the descriptions of the opening chapter are confined to what can be seen from within his shack, visual perspectives increase in variety and number when he ventures out of doors.
This brings into play the logical faculties of discrimination and selection which assimilate perceptual stimuli to previously encountered images on the basis of structural analogy.
Yet contrary to what one might expect, the capacity for assimilation is not accompanied by a discursive restriction.
It leads instead to a proliferation of metaphoric links between objects: the bark of a fig tree is described as looking like ‘a thigh of creased denim’, ‘a system of parallel highways’ and ‘neural cells’(26/28).
A double row of plane trees forms a ‘network of bare branches [that]functions in depth, a corridor of cobwebs full of traps for flies, woven by a giant spider’(21/23).
This image is then used to put in doubt the very existence of its counterpart in the previous chapter:
Unless perhaps a certain period has already elapsed since that episode, if indeed it occurred.
The flies may have been a product of the fine network that functions in depth, in which case they will certainly have got caught in the cobwebs. (21/23)
The metaphor of the spider has here replaced that of the flies, engulfed it in its web.
The web or network of images spun by the protagonist's discourse has subsumed all past images to its present.
The past becomes a projected image created retrospectively at every moment, just as a ‘biogram’ is ‘the abstracted absolute of your conscious patterns throughout your life’.
The spider's web is clearly a pernicious weapon; like the network of branches out of which it grows, it frames and structures all that falls within its domain.
The status of the metaphoric strategies employed by the character is ambiguous.
They are at once a replication of and a threat to the unitary governing structures of the society in which he lives.
This ambiguity is played out in psychological terms as the simultaneous desire and inability to conform to the demands of the master discourse.
Mobility is repeatedly linked in Out to hypertrophy of the imagination which, like a prism, refracts the ‘colourless’ light of the protagonist's civic identity into the protean kaleidoscopic images of his fantasy selves by means of the ‘coloured’language of metaphor.
These fantasy selves are figured as disintegrating reflections (52–5/54–7) or cathartic identifications with objects and people in the world around him (61/63,100/102,104–5/106–7).
The metaphoric proliferation accompanying psychological fragmentation is combated by the repeated invocation of analytic apparatuses that would determine the ontological status of objects perceived and events experienced, but the result is a garbled composite of philosophical jargon:
To live the gesture in immobility is to evoke and therefore to have observed the gesture.
But imagination is not an imaged projection of observed phenomena.
Sometimes it is sufficient to imagine an episode for the episode to occur, and that is the terrifying thing, though not necessarily in that precise form.
The first failure is the beginning of the first lesson.
Learning presupposes great holes in knowledge.
(173/175)
Immobility is linked to the desire for stable identity, to certain knowledge, to fixed images, and to the various clichés of the discourses of authority.
But attempts to fix or stabilize knowledge by means of an array of scientific instruments fail as well, for these instruments generate new metaphors by mixing the concrete with the abstract:
The white veins in the pink marble tremble and nod, they sway and stretch out to catch the excited atoms.
An oscillograph might perhaps reveal whether the hammering which now drives its high-pitched ring of metal on metal into the neural cells also drives into the memory of the conversation, memory being a function, not a place.
An electroencelograph might perhaps separate the components of the conversation into the elements of silence, reality and unreality.
(100/102)
If we consider Out with respect to the conception of metaphor examined above, the desperate sputterings of the main character can be seen as active or ‘verbal’ in their metaphoric function: his discourse mobilizes and metaphorizes all others and has only tenuous links with any reality outside its field of operation.
As he falls further and further ‘out’ of society these links become increasingly strained.
Perception gradually yields territory to fantasy and hallucination as the protagonist's faculty for reality-testing breaks down and doubt increases.
In his weakened state he is unable to control his own metaphors, to keep the various terminologies he deploys distinct.
They act on him and impair his ability to distinguish between thought and perception, between concepts and objects.
Again polysemy serves to join the two.
Aetiology as the philosophical investigation of causality and aetiology as the study of the origin of diseases provides a link between philosophy and physiology.
Symptoms of disease are then ‘embodied’ as a cancerous proliferation of the cognitive faculty which invents aetiologies for its own condition:
The imagination increases in size progressively and usually painlessly until it fills most of the abdomen.
(64/66)
At the moment, the fantasies are under control.
Sooner or later, however, they will pervade the blood-stream and increase at a striking rate, paralysing the skull with tumorous growths (66/68).
It inevitably strikes the reader of Out that the main character enters periodically into what in many respects resembles schizophrenia.
Freud describes schizophrenia as a narcissistic disorder in which the capacity for reality-testing breaks down and the patient hallucinates frequently.
His or her speech is characterized by a tendency to treat words like concrete things and to engage in what Freud calls ‘organ-speech’(1915:204).
Gilles Deleuze describes ‘organ-speech’ as a result of the materialization of language which is then perceived as infiltrating the body.
Organ-ization is accompanied by asemia, as language is reduced to sounds and seen as excrement (1969:107).
Jakobson and Lübbe-Grothues note that the speech of schizophrenics is characterized by the tendency to omit the pronoun ‘I’ as well as a fear of responsibility for independent affirmation or denial which results in ambiguous statements (1980:135).
This corresponds to what Deleuze terms ‘schizo-logic’ in which contradictory propositions are accepted simultaneously.
All these symptoms are displayed by the central consciousness in Out : a breakdown of reality-testing, the concretization of words, organ-speech, omission of the first person pronoun, the proliferation of contradictions, and perception of language as pure sound and as excrement.
Nevertheless, it would perhaps be unjustified to label him ‘schizophrenic’.
The most we can claim is that his social situation and his physical deterioration induces in him a condition that approximates the classical clinical picture given of schizophrenia.
Robert Rogers comments on what is commonly held to be the widespread use of metaphor among schizophrenics.
While he does not deny that they often speak in a manner that ‘normal’ people regard as metaphoric, he points out that poets are aware of the metaphoric nature of their linguistic productions, whereas schizophrenics are not; they use what Rogers calls ‘unlabelled metaphor’(1978:42).
In Out Christine Brooke-Rose makes use of the schizophrenic's unwitting deployment of figurative language as a psychological motivation for her use of it.
The significance of this technique is that it allows the novelist to incorporate metaphor at the level of what is narrated (fabula ), not merely at the level of narration (sjuzet ), as is more commonly the case.
Brooke-Rose does not impose metaphors on the thematic material she employs in Out , rather she chooses to work with material that is already metaphoric.
This use of the naturally occurring metaphor in the speech of schizophrenics is a limit case of the more general phenomenon of metaphor as a thought process.
Schizophrenic speech provides a metaphor for metaphor, and it is in this sense that its use in Out may be understood, not as a valorization of the psychotic condition but as a literalization of the figure.
In addition to its formal dimension, this use of metaphor also has a political function.
The protagonist makes efforts to salvage his crumbling psyche by identifying with the languages of authority.
At one point he faints, and as he slowly regains consciousness he imagines that he is being ordered to ‘merge’ through ‘osmosis’(109/111).
For those who refuse or are unable to conform to discursive conditioning, the message is unequivocal:
The physical stuff of the universe wraps up the earth with knowledge and communication, and the earth shrinks, and those who do not partake of the great secret growth are eliminated and shrivel away under the physical stuff that is knowledge and communication and wraps the earth with love, for nothing less than symbiosis will do.
(178/180)
The colourless are incapable of ‘symbiosis’ and participation in the communication that ‘wraps the earth with love’, for they are incapable of ‘radiating energy’.
Despite the rhetoric of the multi-racial society ‘Exalting all colours to the detriment of none’(123/125), it would appear that the weak are doomed.
In the closing pages of A Rhetoric of the Unreal Brooke-Rose discusses the mystico-technological dream of Teillard de Chardin, Marshall McLuhan, and others whom, following Ihab Hassan (1975), she designates as ‘new gnostics’.
Their vision of ‘the planet being as it were wrapped in telepathic or electronic thought of more and more brains working away’ seems to her ‘dangerously like the pollution that may stifle it’and ‘essentially an elitist dream’(1981:388).
She asks why these dreams should ‘be given the supreme power of enveloping the planet (conquering the world), when neither those dreams nor man have shown the slightest capacity for solving the world's real problems, only a brilliant capacity for displacing them’(389).
In the light of these remarks,Out may be read as a dystopic version of a ‘global village’ in which the technology that ‘wraps the earth’has disambiguated and simplified life for the privileged, who then use the founding truth of their colonial system as a weapon against the underprivileged.
This weapon is a coercive metaphor or conceptual structuring lens which carves up the world according to its needs and either conditions or eradicates colourless inhabitants by subjecting them to ‘diagnosis’ or excluding them from ‘symbiosis’in a perpetual present.
Out extends to breaking-point the possibilities of classical empiricist philosophy, and the ultimate failure of this philosophy leads to the full-scale paradigm shift dramatized in the novel.
In a society which has fully internalized the consequences of the Einsteinian revolution and its off-shoots, an epistemology based on the postulates of classical scientific models is unable to cope with social structures formed according to this new way of thinking.
The single perspective of an individual subject proves inadequate to the task of processing the sensory data that flood his consciousness.
In terms of narrative technique, breakdown is manifested through the gradual dissolution of framing devices and ambiguity as to the ontological status of the objects of description.
In psychological terms this conforms to the classical description of schizophrenia.
In all three respects — philosophical, narrative, and psychological — the novel highlights the failure of traditional conventions and modes of thought by contrasting them with a grotesque parody of the social and discursive consequences of modern scientific theory.
This must not be read, however, as a nostalgic plea for a return to the age of classical epistemology.
It is a warning that any science which claims to be authoritative has the potential for being used as a discourse of domination.
Metaphor in Out is used in two distinct ways: on the one hand, the medical theory ‘diagnosis prognosticates aetiology’ is extended coercively to other domains of thought; on the other hand, the mind's capacity for variation and mutation leads the main character to produce creative metaphors which distort, subvert, and ‘mobilize’the language of authority.
In this latter attempt to turn the coercive action of metaphor back on itself lies the seed of the type of metaphor developed in Such .
2.2 Such: Disrupting Accepted Modes of Thought.
Whereas in Out a single dominant ideology acts as a structuring device on a wide variety of discourses in the society portrayed, in Such two discourses are selected and their interaction is staged within the mind of the protagonist.
Such thus represents a focusing or narrowing of the type of metaphoric relation developed in Out .
In Such the discourse of astrophysics is used to subvert that of classical psychoanalysis.
Astrophysics is concerned with bodies of cosmic proportions, but it is also involved with the smallest of particles, those postulated by quantum mechanics.
Specifically, astrophysics studies the origin of the universe through analysis of the characteristics of subatomic particles of light, matter, and energy.
Thus while Out dramatizes the consequences of the principle of relativity for the observation of effects,Such turns instead to the exploration of the origins of identity in terms of contemporary theories of cosmic birth.
The concepts of astrophysics are mapped onto the human psyche in such a way as to contest the assumptions which depth psychology has popularized.
Such begins with the voice in the first-person describing the process of climbing out of his coffin into an unknown world of orbits and ellipses.
He meets a character who describes herself as a ‘girl-spy’.
When he insists that they must have names, she agrees to call him ‘Someone’ and allows him to call her ‘Something’.
Something carries on her arm five offspring, variously described as planets, moons, and cylinders.
Someone adopts two of these creatures and urges that they too be named.
Accordingly, the five bodies are baptized with the names of famous Blues songs: ‘Dippermouth’, ‘Gut Bucket’, ‘Potato Head’, ‘Tin Roof’, and ‘Really’.
Upon receiving names they fly off into orbit, and return one by one during the course of the first part of the novel to be given ‘rebirth’ by Someone.
We eventually learn that Someone is a psychiatrist called Larry who works for a group of astrophysicists at a scientific research laboratory.
While undergoing an operation his heart has stopped, but he has come back to life after having been declared dead and deposited in a coffin.
The opening of the novel is then the story of his ‘death’: the time between ‘dying’ and coming back to full consciousness, a period of uncertain length, but possibly covering two years or more.
The adventures of Someone, Something and their five children are a hallucination experienced by Larry while his body is at a low level of psychic energy.
Something is his unconscious, and the planets or children are aspects of his life that return to him as he slowly readjusts to reality.
During his convalescence one of Larry's colleagues, Professor Head, explains to him the basic principles of astrophysics, and it gradually becomes clear that the intra-personal death story is also a metaphoric transposition of the laws of astrophysics onto the dreaming or hallucinating mind.
Someone and Something take on the attributes of cosmic bodies.
They have ‘meridians’ instead of arms, as well as‘atmospheric densities’which bend laws, and they emit light.
The lost ‘geometries of the psyche’ that govern their existence are intertwined with the materialized properties of discourse.
They take a trip in a ‘means of communication’ to the limits of language at the ultra-violet end of the verbal spectrum, and Someone is fuelled by the ‘internal combustion’of words (22/218,51/247).
Larry's return to life is recounted most extensively in the second part of the novel.
Since his operation he has become emotionally distant from his family and friends.
He is not well enough to return to his previous job, and his wife eventually leaves him.
A number of journalists try to exploit then novelty of his ‘death and amazing recovery’; other people who try to help him find him difficult to relate to.
He claims not to remember anything of his ‘death’, but various events in the death story recur in his second life: he confuses the five moon-children he fathers with his real children, and he speaks of people as though they were cosmic bodies.
He also has a new-found ability to ‘read’ people.
His eyes resemble dish-telescopes that seem to look right through his friends, and he sees the psychic energy people emit as an astrophysicist's radio-telescope ‘sees’ sounds bounced off distant galaxies.
Like the protagonist in Out , Larry interprets his own identity through the discourses that organize his experience.
Nothing can be taken ‘as such’ in this novel; it is always read through the screen of metaphoric focus.
But the question of the hierarchy between the two discourses involved in the metaphoric relation takes on a new light in Such .
Domination is not a matter of coercion by a social system, but of the distorting action of one discourse on another in the mind of the protagonist.
The discourse of astrophysics dominates as an organizing metaphor in the first part of the novel where it structures Someone's identity.
In the second part, Larry internalizes the discursive metaphor and deploys it in order to describe psychological phenomena.
In this second part he discusses his identity in terms of quantum mechanics.
After grappling over the course of the novel with his essential nature and that of those around him, he finally renounces his quest for a fixed meaning, a completed story:
— Larry, everyone deserves the attention of definiteness.
— Even if they prefer the uncertainty principle?
— They only pretend to prefer it.
While they have to.
You used to say that.
Someone would come along and find a unified theory that would do away with indeterminate interpretations, you'd say, and revert to causality.
I thought perhaps you might.
— I thought so too.
In psychic terms at least.
But I didn't.
In the meantime we do the best we can, some of us preferring to pretend causality exists, and others, others preferring to prefer its absence.
(191/387)
Causality is here contrasted with indeterminacy: either one pretends that the origin of psychological peculiarities is known and that it has the force of explanation, as in classical psychoanalysis, or one chooses to relinquish this concept and to see identity as a matter of discontinuity and flux.
Cautiously opting for the latter view, Larry bends the laws of astrophysics to construct a theory of subjectivity through the metaphoric lens of the uncertainty principle:
I think I believe that every particle of ourselves, whether combined with those of others in normal electrovalence to make up this or that slice of us, or whether bombarded by those of others until this or that human element mutates into some other, every particle of ourselves returns.
So that it has, in that sense, identity.
But you can never quite identify it at any given moment.
(191–2/387–8)
According to this theory, people are composed of discrete quanta that exist only in combination with those of others.
When the mechanics of causality have been forsaken, identity can never be known or measured, it can only be postulated and experienced.
Furthermore, an individual is at each moment only a partial manifestation of an identity revealed over time, what physicists call a ‘sum over histories’.
As a consequence of this underlying indeterminacy, names change, words are broken, and the laws of social interaction perpetually altered.
As his theory suggests, Larry has lost faith in traditional psychiatry.
If the discourse of psychoanalysis is read in the light of the uncertainty principle, it becomes evident that a reconstruction or aetiology of a patient's illness is impossible, for, like the ‘biogram’ in Out , the analytic process itself would alter the unconscious memories and phantasies that constitute traces of the origin of an illness.
Furthermore, Larry describes the matter that constitutes the density of his and other people's psyches as ‘resistance’(49/245), and in effect the density and opacity of his mind is also a permanent barrier to a clear understanding of his experiences, both past and present.
Someone has an ‘excrescent scar’(8/204) on his belly which mutates into a camera lens, an ‘eye gashed’(25/221) and a ‘birthmark’(54/250).
In Freudian terms these would be clear symbols of the fear of castration, but the laws of classical psychoanalytic interpretation are bent and broken in Such , and if anything it is the concept of the castration complex itself that is mutilated by its subjection to the laws of physics.
The scar, trace of an origin, is lost.
Professor Head makes this quite clear in the contrast he makes between Larry's former profession and his own:
We tap the silent telephones of outer space, we bounce our questions on the galaxies which answer out of aeons.
But they give no names, no explanations, only infinities of calculations.
You on the other hand give names to the complex geometries of the soul, you explain perhaps, but do you heal, within spacetime I mean.
These maps represent something, certainly, but not the ultimate mystery of the first creation that has gone for ever with its scar inside one huge unstable atom.
(75/271)
Analysis will not enable Larry to access the causes of the emotions and fears he ‘reads’ in the maps of people's minds any more than physicists will be able to ‘discover’the origin of the universe.
In his own attempt to ‘map’ the origins of life onto the individual psyche, Freud came to an unsettling conclusion.
Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920) elaborates a theory of the death drive that very much resembles the concept of entropy used by physicists.
All life, he claims, strives in its forward movement to return to the quiescence from which it arose, a state it achieves finally in death.
If it is at this point that Freud's theory exceeds itself and is forced beyond the realm of the verifiable into that of speculation, this is also the point at which Such picks up the Freudian way of thinking.
Larry sees people as things, as emissions of particles and waves which his wife explains as radioactive decay:
I have come to the conclusion that you see radiation, Larry, and radiation consists after all of decay, degradation so that you see the death that lies inherent in all living existence.
(107/303)
Larry accepts this explanation and links it with his vague memories of the death world.
He cannot reconstruct his death, but its consequences are still felt:
I remember nothing but opaqueness.
Or something perhaps…moving through space forwards but back at the same time, as if I consisted of anti-matter for ever cancelled out…as if in all our words and gestures, acts and attitudes we effected some sort of parallel penetration into whatever had originated them, their primeval atom, with built-in unstableness. (107–108/303–4)
During the death story Tin Roof tells Someone that they don't ‘move in time’(133/329), but when he comes back to life, Larry feels as if he ‘live[s] backwards’(104/300) and hears conversations ‘in waves that run backwards through time’(103/299).
He believes that he has ‘lost something vital and positive’(146/342) in coming back to life, and wishes to ‘die again' (104/300), for he feels like a White Dwarf, or degenerate star that is very dense but not very bright.
Freud's theory of the death wish finds a parallel in the schizophrenic experiences described by R. D. Laing, whose work had a significant impact on a number of novelists of the period (see section 6.2 below).
Laing rejected classical psychoanalysis just as quantum theory rejected classical physics.
He believed that clinical descriptions of neuroses do not take into account the inner experiences of the patient which may be valid and even illuminating.
Larry would agree.
During his death he takes a series of trips in different vehicles: the airplane-like ‘vehicle of communication’, a boat, a car, a horse-drawn buggy and finally the cranial spaceship from which he is ultimately ejected back into life.
In an article originally published in 1964, Laing describes similar voyages into ‘inner space’ often recounted by people who have been diagnosed as schizophrenics.
He characterizes the phenomenon as follows:
This journey is experienced as going further ‘in’, as going back through one's personal life, in and back and through and beyond into the experience of all mankind, of the primal man, of Adam and perhaps even further into the being of animals, vegetables and minerals.
(1967:104)
A sense of loss of identity causes the voyager to project what he or she encounters so as to perceive it as an external phenomenon, and also to introject elements of the familiar world in order to recreate a recognizable context.
If Larry's death is understood as an inner voyage of the type described by Laing, a voyage occasioned by the physical trauma of a heart attack, many of the puzzling aspects of the novel begin to make more sense.
The metaphoric transposition of characteristics of outer space onto inner space can be seen as a characteristic attempt to give known form to that which is unfamiliar.
The name ‘Someone’ that the protagonist is given during his death indicates his loss of social identity: he is no one in particular but all people, for his nuclear death family constitutes the ‘primeval atom’.
This unusual situation provides a motivation for bringing together the extreme poles of our everyday understanding of space and time: the most outer and the most inner, the first and the last.
As in Out , schizophrenic discourse operates as a metaphoric tool that allows the novel to focus, like its concrete counterpart the radio telescope, on the limits of our spatio-temporal universe.
But while in Out schizophrenic discourse is an indication of psychological breakdown, in Such it represents, in Laing's terms, a breakthrough.
Though Larry does not ultimately succeed in reintegrating himself into the world, his efforts to come to terms with the consequences of his experience in the death world of his hallucination indicate a potential mode of interpersonal relation that would provide the basis for a more ‘sane’ existence.
Psychological alienation provides Such with a narrative pretext for bringing the theories of post-Einsteinian science to bear on the way we conceive of ourselves as individuals in relation to other people.
This is accomplished by metaphorically fitting the discourse of astrophysics on to that of psychology.
The ‘laws’ of the latter are altered as a consequence, and their validity as laws is challenged by their interaction with the uncertainties implicit in astrophysics.
The use of metaphor to unsettle a discourse which has widespread authority in our culture demonstrates that metaphor need not necessarily play a coercive role, that it can serve an interrogatory function as well.
This extension of the role of metaphor leads the way for the development of multiple, reversible discursive metaphor which is manifest in Between .
2.3 Between: The Multiple, Reversible Metaphor.
In contrast to the main characters of Out and Such , the anonymous protagonist of Between appears to be relatively well adapted to the world in which she lives and travels.
This is the world of airplanes, hotels, multinational conferences and multilingual small-talk, a spinning jumble of infinite variations on the same models.
She uses reversible metaphor to perform an integrative operation on this material, bringing it together in a mobile yet highly structured whole that turns around a small number of common patterns.
Between achieves a balance between the mobility and indeterminacy inherent in the postulates of our post-Einsteinian age and the rigid conventions toward which mass culture tends.
It does not provide a resolution of the conflict in either psychological or social terms, but because of the aesthetic coherence of the novel, the problem itself is stated more forcefully than it is in either of the two previous works.
In the traditional realist novel the plot provides a principle of organization, while symbolic structures are fitted in around this frame.
But like Out and Such ,Between takes as its principle of organization a network of associations formed in the verbal consciousness of the protagonist.
This structure is not ‘literary’ in the sense of being above and beyond the mundane, or at a higher aesthetic level than that achieved by the characters implicated in it.
Rather, as in Out and Such , the structure of the novel reflects the means by which the day-to-day world is apprehended.
The metaphoric juxtaposition of incongruous thematic material is motivated by the exigencies of the main character's job as a simultaneous interpreter.
She speaks several languages and partakes of many specialized vocabularies in the context of her daily existence.
Although none of the words she utters professionally is her own, fragments of the lectures she translates at conferences constantly invade her thoughts.
She is, in her professional capacity, the site of convergence of many discourses but the generator of none.
In her private life material from conference lectures is combined with the pop-culture mythology of advertisements, phrase-book dialogues, and other public texts in a number of languages to generate a network of images that is in turn linked to semi-conscious obsessions and childhood memories.
The story-line of Between is far from straightforward, but it is logically relatively unambiguous.
As in Out and Such , free direct speech interspersed with actual and remembered dialogue is the primary mode of the novel, but unlike the two previous works,Between renders the observations and fantasies of a sane mind in a familiar world.
The protagonist has a French mother and a German father.
She was brought up in France just before the Second World War, but as an adolescent she was sent to spend a year with relatives in Germany where she was forced to remain when fighting broke out.
During the war she worked as a translator, and at the time of the action of the novel she has taken up this trade again recently.
Though punctuated by frequent flash-backs to the period before, during and just after the war, temporal progression in the present is clearly marked by the development of two narrative lines which weave their ways in and out of the novel.
The first is the saga of the protagonist's marriage annulment, involving several hearings, frequent trips to Rome, and a good deal of frustration.
The second revolves around a series of love-letters written in Medieval French.
It is eventually discovered that they are from the ageing Frenchman Bertrand.
The protagonist laughs at the letters at first and refuses to answer them, but eventually her curiosity is piqued and she engages in a prolonged correspondence with her admirer.
This ends abruptly when the two finally meet and discover that ‘fornication by airmail’ is more enjoyable than the real thing.
While there is little ambiguity as to what ‘happens’ in the novel, the temporal perspective from which events are recounted is not well defined.
Events do not succeed each other in time, instead reversible metaphor is used to inaugurate shifts between scenes, none of which is more ‘proper’ or ‘metaphoric’than any other.
This process is illustrated in the following passage which switches from hotel room to airport on the basis of a structural analogy:
…the black and red patterned blanket folded over with the top sheet to form two parallel white borders from which the planes move slowly off, rise suddenly and vanish or come in out of the low grey cloud….(10–11/404–5)
The novel begins and ends with the description of a commercial airplane interior, to which it often returns.
It is possible that the entire text is a combination of description and recollection from the perspective of a single flight, in which case it takes place over the course of a few hours, the time it takes to read it.
Equally, the airplane interiors described could all be different, though they look alike, and in fact the novel could span ten years or more.
This devaluation of the temporal aspect of the story through temporal ambiguity serves to displace logical emphasis from chronological continuity onto other structural patterns.
The metaphoric networks that bind together thematic sequences are organized by two underlying figures: enclosure and penetration.
Enclosure is manifest in many forms; it is at once the womb-like interior of airplane, the surface of the body, the frame of a window, the border between countries, and the boundary between discourses.
In short, enclosure comes to signify insularity and the maintenance of distinct divisions between things.
It is associated with the Catholic Church, the institution of marriage, loyalty to the fatherland, and belief in general.
The protagonist also feels the need to insulate herself emotionally, a form of protectionism which bears a problematic resemblance to the cultural chauvinism and xenophobia she witnesses during the war.
The tendency toward enclosure and fixed meanings is thus political and personal, as well as discursive.
The contrary tendency towards transgression, inter-penetration, invasion, and the erosion of emotional walls of defence is manifested most explicitly as polyglossia and the multilingual play of words.
This mixing of linguistic and cultural codes is frequently linked to the sexual act: ‘as if words fraternised silently beneath the syntax, finding each other funny and delicious in a Misch-Masch of tender fornication’(53/447).
Illicit relations with the enemy during war-time echo also in the recurrent phrase ‘the languages fraternise behind their own façades’(55/449; variations: 53/447,123/517,148/542,154/548).
‘Fraternization’ then becomes a catch-word for describing the work of the reversible metaphor which plays havoc with entrenched political power relations by transgressing personal, cultural, and national frontiers.
The ‘fraternization’ of disparate discourses provides a point of transfer between narrative compartments and metaphoric networks that are logically, temporally, or thematically distant.
These transition-metaphors operate at several discursive levels.
They can hinge on words that have more than one meaning or more than one usage, words that rhyme or sound similar, common thematic elements, or common symbolic associations.
The passages that follow illustrate the mechanics of this type of metaphor.
In the first example a transition is accomplished when a single word pivots on its axis of signification during the course of a sentence:
The words prevent any true EXCHANGE caught in the late afternoon sun. (5/399)
The word ‘EXCHANGE’ transposes the intellectual exchange of ideas into a commercial context while at the same time ‘highlighting’the signifier, the letters on the sign of a bureau de change.
One definition is exchanged for another, semantic currency is taken from one discursive economy and converted into the currency of another.
But this interruption also blocks the passage of ideas by shifting emphasis away from the signified.
The polysemic capacity of the signifier is what, in effect, prevents the passage of meaning.
Throughout the novel no idea exists in isolation.
During the process of ‘translation’, the signifier inevitably intercepts the signified and draws each word into a network of other concepts.
Like the discursive ‘slips’ discussed with reference to Out , the word ‘EXCHANGE’partakes simultaneously of two non-commensurate discourses.
It thus fulfils the affirmative function of transmission and the negative function of prevention, both of which are designated semantically.
Polysemy again operates as an agent of transition between contexts in the following sentence in which a customs declaration becomes a declaration of love:
Have you anything to declare such as love desire ambition or a glimpse that in this air-conditioning and other circumstantial emptiness freedom has its sudden attractions as the body floats in willing suspension of responsibility to anyone.
(28/422)
Even after migration between discursive realms has been effected, the juridical flavour of the customs declaration is not completely relinquished.
It haunts the remainder of the passage.
The phrase ‘circumstantial emptiness’ echoes ‘circumstantial evidence’, and ‘freedom’is linked to the ‘suspension of responsibility’experienced when the body ‘floats’inside an airplane, suspended between borders, ideologies and romantic involvements.
The discourse of authority represented by customs is outwitted when the text escapes into the domain of personal relations through a semantic back-door in the word ‘declaration’.
But the evasion is not completely successful, for the authorities have semantic outposts in other words as well.
In these examples descriptions of exchange and the crossing of frontiers illustrate the move from one discursive domain to another, showing how such actions can be made to function as textual manoeuvres and figure the metaphoric strategies of the imagination.
It is clear that power relations and territorial rights (personal and otherwise) are implicated in this process.
As in Out , the invasions operated by metaphor both subvert authority and threaten personal security.
But Between portrays a successful navigation between the desire to transgress and the need for the stability provided by insularity.
Unlike the characters in the two previous novels, the protagonist emerges safe and sound from her semiotic entanglements.
As we have seen, metaphoric reversibility is figured in the text thematically as the condition of being suspended between ideologies, languages and countries, or as the act of crossing from one to another.
This is one's situation in an airplane, for instance, and in linguistic terms it is a state of verbal anarchy, the condition under which languages ‘fraternize’.
Politically, between-ness ‘help[s] to abolish the frontiers of misunderstanding with frequent changes of partners loyalties convictions, free and easily stepping over the old boundaries’(43/437).
But sexual and intellectual promiscuity — the frequent substitution of one partner, idea or belief for another — involves a constant deferral of meaning that leads inevitably to a distrust of language and an uneasiness with regard to self-definition.
It is significant that, as Brooke-Rose elsewhere notes (1981:413), the verb ‘to be’ is never used in Between .
This calls into question the concept of ‘ontological recognition’ which provides, according to one speaker whose paper the protagonist translates, a means for the individual of achieving reintegration and ‘totality’(112/506).
But the absence is in fact only a dissimulation, for etymologically the word ‘between’ is a fusion of ‘be’and ‘two’.
The condition of ‘between-ness’ is then one of doubling which is at the origin of ‘fraternization’and transgression.
The body is repeatedly described as floating between two states and harbouring contradictory feelings simultaneously.
Nothing is simply or singly, to be is to be between ideas, beliefs, cultures, and discourses.
The images and symbols that are used in Between to demonstrate the mechanics of the imagination do not pretend to be original; they are self-consciously mined in the cultural history of the West.
Brooke-Rose attempts rather to use old material in new ways.
By means of juxtaposition and carefully-wrought connections, she fuses the cognitive processes of metaphoric structuration and epistemological organization.
What ‘happens’ is linked in the protagonist's mind to the networks of her imagination.
The latter become the ‘mensonge vital’ of fantasy and fiction that provides her with a means of coping in a hostile world.
Between demonstrates how a multiplicity of different discursive systems intertwine to form the substrata of an individual mind which plays them off against each other, combines them and uses them to generate the repertory of stories that determine how she ‘reads’ the world in which she lives.
By focusing the conception of metaphor Brooke-Rose developed in the 1950s on Out ,Such , and Between , I have demonstrated how these novels elaborate the implications of what she herself recognized then as metaphor's chief virtue: its ability to animate and to mobilize the structures on which it works.
Her use of metaphor is based on the ‘poetic’ technique of repetition and variation of the same elements in an ever-expanding cosmos of contexts.
In Out the proliferation of various permutations of the same material is a reaction against the coercive use of metaphor, but it eventually leads to psycho-discursive disintegration as the central consciousness loses control over his own faculties of thought and reason.
In Such an alternative world is proposed, a world of indeterminacy which allows for variation and flux, with a theory of identity to match it.
But though this world informs the real world, it does not have the power to change it, for Larry is unsuccessful in convincing others of the validity of his theory.
Finally in Between a balance is struck between the proliferation of metaphor on the one hand, and fixed semantic boundaries on the other, and it is in the more formally controlled context of this novel that discursive metaphor achieves the full realization of its potential as an agent of linguistic and conceptual refraction.
Out ,Such , and Between represent the first steps in Christine Brooke-Rose's ongoing exploration of the complex relations between subjectivity and the discursive matrix in which it is embedded.
This has led her beyond the sciences, but the philosophical and literary implications of her involvement with the theories of Heisenberg and others have left a lasting mark on her work.
In seeking to develop a technique that would be compatible with the findings of modern physics, she demonstrates the relevance of even the most abstract of concepts to our understanding of ourselves and our relation to others through language.
She also succeeds in integrating conceptual and psychological material in such a way as to portray individual experience without turning the fictional character into a mere conduit for information.
The technique of discursive metaphor allows the individual to be depicted as both passively spoken through by language and actively involved in the discursive process of identity-construction.
This conception of subjectivity paves the way for the contestation in Brooke-Rose's later fiction of the hierarchical relations implicit in the conceptions of discursive identity by which we live.
Chapter III
Between, Thru, and Amalgamemnon: Gender and the Discourses of the Human Sciences
‘Plus vaut encore de ne parler que par équivoques, allusions, sous-entendus’(Irigaray 1974:178)
Christine Brooke-Rose's growing interest in structuralist linguistics is evident in her novels of the 1960s in the use of creative juxtaposition and other devices which depend for their effect on the relations between elements rather than on the elements ‘as such’.
In Out and Such one discourse is brought to bear on another through metaphor; in Between ,Thru , and Amalgamemnon the same type of metaphor is used to bring a number of discourses together in an increasingly interrogative conjunction.
In these novels Brooke-Rose exploits the rhetorical force of the metaphoric technique by employing it to explore, among other things, gender stereotypes as they are manifest in specialized discourses.
The three novels exhibit a growing confidence in a central female persona's attitude toward her use of language.
In Between the protagonist confronts the jargons of a number of fields from a female perspective.
Though the result is often parodic, she is a conveyer, not an active producer of these jargons.
In Thru the discourses of literary theory are manipulated in part by a female voice, but active questioning of their status and function is accomplished on the level of the novel's overall orchestration and its symbolic structure.
In Amalgamemnon the central female character takes an overtly subversive approach.
She both appropriates and adulterates the discourses of history, challenging their claim to tell the truth and their implicit exclusion of women from positions of discursive authority.
In each novel there is an effect of double-voicing: the female voice speaks through the discourses in question in such a way as to shift their emphasis.
She uses them selectively and strategically to reveal the assumptions behind them and their hidden agendas.
Brooke-Rose's use of double-voicing is a natural extension of the metaphoric combination of discourses in her first two experimental novels.
But it is also a technique that is ‘parodic’ in the Bakhtinian sense, or ‘subversively mimetic’in the sense that Luce Irigaray uses this concept.
Both theorists valorize polyphonic discourse because it implicitly questions the notion of the unitary subject and the binary logic which subtends this notion.
Bakhtin's theory of dialogism had a significant influence on French theorists of the late 1960s, and many of their conceptions of the disruptive power of certain kinds of language follow a similar logic.
Julia Kristeva and Gilles Deleuze both reject the Aristotelian logic of the excluded middle which they see as being based on the subject-predicate structure of the sentence.
Kristeva posits a poetic 0–2 logic that is ‘transfini’ or ‘dialogique (1969:92,141–4).
It is the logic that transgresses the unitary 1 of ‘Dieu, la loi, la définition’(90); it is the logic of ambivalence and of the ‘polyphonic’ novel, for fiction, as she defines it, is ‘cette réunion non-synthétique entre ‘est’et ‘n'est pas’'(1974:353).
Deleuze elaborates a ‘logique du sens’ valorizing paradox and ‘synthèse disjonctive’(1969:84), while Derrida's ‘logique du supplément’(1967) and his quaternary chiasmatic logic (1972a) provide a means of integrating indeterminacy or ‘play’into the heart of binary structures.
The attempt to subvert binary logic threatens to invalidate the structuralist enterprise, and it is not without reason that in the early seventies Kristeva, Irigaray, and other women theorists began to map structuralism's binary logic onto the social and discursive oppression of women by men.
Lévi-Strauss had already described the fundamental structure of society and language in terms of the exchange of women, which he saw as the basis of all exchange:
…les règles de la parenté et du mariage servent á assurer la communication des femmes entre les groupes, comme les règles économiques servent á assurer la communication des biens et des services, et les règles linguistiques, la communication des messages.
(1958:95)
Citing Lévi-Strauss's analogy between the object of exchange in each of these systems and Jakobson's zero-phoneme, Jacques Lacan draws out the consequences of this paradigm for (male) discourse:
…la Dette inviolable est la garantie que le voyage où sont poussés femmes et biens ramène en un cycle sans manquement á leur point de départ d'autres femmes et d'autres biens, porteurs d'une entité identique: symbole zéro, dit Lévi-Strauss, réduisant á la forme d'un signe algébrique le pouvoir de la Parole.
(1966:279)
He goes on to link Lévi-Strauss's idea of exchange as the mastery of women to Freud's interpretation of his grandson's game of fort/da as a representation of the alternation of presence and absence.
Lacan reasons that the accession to subjectivity is accomplished through the accession to language which involves the substitution of linguistic presence and absence for the presence and absence of the desired object (284–5,318–19).
The child becomes a discursive subject when it succeeds in controlling the departure and return of its mother through symbolic mastery.
Language use is thus dependent on the suppression of the mother ‘beneath the bar’ of signification because ‘le symbole se manifeste d'abord comme le meurtre de la chose’(319).
Women obviously have an interest in contesting this understanding of language as the exchange and symbolic annihilation of their sex.
Since it is based on Lévi-Strauss's binary conception in which women figure as absent (0) and men as present (1), the unitary male discursive subject is the first target of the feminist deconstructive enterprise.
The logic of 0–2, or disjunctive inclusion, rejects the principle of the excluded middle; like the Freudian unconscious, it is thus able to accept contradiction.
The unconscious as ‘process’, the ‘imaginary’, and the zone of the pre-symbolic are privileged in the feminized logical structures of Cixous (1975), Kristeva (1974), and others because they mark the areas in which male domination and discursive control are incomplete or ineffective.
The gendering of logical structures leads Kristeva in 1974 to posit a distinction between the ‘semiotic’(Lacan's ‘Imaginary’) and the ‘symbolic’.
The semiotic is closely associated with the mother in that it is pre-discursive (pre-Oedipal).
It can therefore not be articulated on its own; it must be spoken through the language of the symbolic, just as in Bakhtin's ‘dialogic’ conception of parody one voice speaks through another which it seeks to undermine.
The semiotic surfaces as rhythmic pulses, disturbances in logic, and other ‘poetic’ mechanisms that mark it as the source of the ‘poetic’in writing (1974:22–30, see also Brooke-Rose 1981:342).
Luce Irigaray sees a similar process at work in the language of the hysteric which is never able to assert itself as definitive or complete (1966:29–30).
In her analyses of Freud's conception of female sexuality, she demonstrates that Freud's view of women as lack or as absence forces them into the discursive position of the hysteric because it denies them autonomous identity and obliges them to mimic the voice of the dominant male if they wish to be heard at all(1974:66–71).
Their voice is stigmatized by men as a ‘foisonnement de phantasmes, de fantômes, d'ombres'(70), in other words, as the voice of non-truth.
It can only ever be a mimicry, for, as Irigaray argues, women can never accede to the condition of subjectivity: ‘Toute théorie du ‘sujet’ aura toujours été appropriée au ‘masculin’'(165).
They are forced to operate in the pre-subjective domain of the specular imaginary, using a tactic of ‘mimétisme ’(subversive mimesis) that Irigaray both describes and illustrates in her writing.
Women's discourse may only be a flawed copy of its male counterpart, but, as Irigaray shows, women can use this apparent deficiency to their advantage by allowing the ‘bad copy’ to become a subversive caricature in which the difference between the double and the ‘original’reveals the gender bias underlying male discourse and (male) subjectivity (1977:73–4).
What Irigaray describes as mimétisme can also be thought of as parody.
According to Bakhtin, parody is a ‘dialogic’ form which frees consciousness from the coercive force of ‘monologic’language by registering the distance between language and reality (1981:60).
In an article first published in 1985 Brooke-Rose discusses the theories of parody developed by both Bakhtin and Genette (1985c; revised in 1991a:191–203).
She compares Bakhtin's definition of parody as divergent bifocal discourse based on the degree of presence and orientation of ‘voices’ with Genette's more restricted definition of the term.
Genette distinguishes parody from other forms of ‘hypertextuality’ as that ludic mode which effects punctual and systematic transformations of specific texts while retaining the noble style of the original (1982:33–5).
According to both these definitions Between ,Thru , and Amalgamemnon exhibit parodic elements.
They contain punctual alterations of specific texts, and they stage the confrontation between two or more voices.
But all three novels also exhibit significant variations on parody as it has been practised in the past.
The internal relations of the multiple ‘voices’ in Brooke-Rose's parodies are considerably more complex than in the examples Bakhtin analyses; though their ‘orientations’are not always directly opposed, they nevertheless succeed in deflecting the text away from its nominal object and making the reader aware of the devices they use.
With reference to Genette's definition they are exceptional in that their object texts are not only other ‘noble’ works of literature but quotations from scholars, product labels, radio broadcasts, advertisements, propaganda slogans, and various other ‘public texts’or textual objets trouvés .
The radical ‘para’ found in both ‘paradox’and ‘parody’provides a spatial model for a variety of techniques displayed in the novels.
Meaning both ‘against’ and ‘beside’, ‘para’suggests a tactic of confrontation through juxtaposition.
Between ,Thru , and Amalgamemnon manifest structures of adjacency or alterity in which exemplary texts of both past and present are invoked and implicitly questioned by being brought together and made to interact; their semantic orientation is refracted by the context in which they are placed and their referential function remotivated.
This form of parodic engagement with the discursive edifices erected by a male-dominated society is depicted in the novels as a distinctly feminine linguistic strategy.
It is suggested that only by acting on the systems which constrain them can women hope to free themselves, and each of the three novels explores different possible forms this discursive action can take.
Nevertheless, Christine Brooke-Rose does not classify herself as a feminist.
Though Between and Thru exhibit striking parallels with the emergent thinking in the late 1960s and early 1970s about the relation of women to language, it was not until nearly fifteen years later that she began to make use of gender-specific arguments in her critical writings.
In the mid 1980s she became increasingly conscious of the links between gender and reception.
Since that time she has published four articles in which she discusses the problems women experimental writers face (1986d, 1988a, 1989a, 1989c; see also 1989e).
In each case she argues that female creativity has been constructed by men as a contradiction in terms.
In the article ‘Illiterations’(1989a; revised in 1991a:250–64) she demonstrates that the development of the Western conception of creativity in women and men is based on metaphors of reproduction which figure woman's role as the material ‘work’ of child-bearing, and the experience of men as spontaneous spurts of genius.
But she points out that men have also appropriated the female role (which is more active) as a painless metaphor for their own artistic endeavours:
For men have always had it both ways: the begetting and the travail (the travail which, as ‘work’ belongs to culture, but which as bearing and ‘labour’belongs to nature); the genius and the work (the genius which is itself both passive possession and authoritative production), the penis and the womb.
Man has in fact appropriated, to represent his relation to truth or God, both aspects of woman's role in relation to man: the being made fecund and the travail. (1991a:256–7; italics in the original)
In Between ,Thru , and Amalgamemnon Brooke-Rose reappropriates for women the role of one whose relation to language is both active and passive, that of the producer as well as the means of production.
This paradoxical role is represented in Between and Amalgamemnon by the symbol of Jonas inside the whale, waiting to be ‘reborn’.
It is the provisional position of the female subject who is still dependent on discourses developed by men and saturated with their prejudices.
While she awaits her birth into her own voice, she can only speak through the voices of others, but this ‘speaking through’ also constitutes her struggle to get out.
The refraction and fusion of discourses accomplished by discursive metaphor provided Brooke-Rose with the technical means for the strategy of mimétisme with which she began to experiment in Between .
Soon after, she recognized in a certain strain of feminist theory an approach to language which had much in common with the approach she herself had been developing over a number of years.
The feminist arguments in favour of dialogic forms of language use helped her to clarify her own reasons for employing discursive metaphor and parody, and the gendering by feminists of the notion of the ‘bad copy’ enabled her to incorporate her own techniques of mis-representation into a readily recognizable social context.
Brooke-Rose's engagement with feminist theory is typical of her encounter with literary theory in general.
In a recent essay she claims to have had a strong sense of déjá-vu upon first reading theories of post-structuralism and postmodernism, for though she had never been able to articulate them clearly in conceptual form, she had discovered many of the concepts these theories present through writing fiction (1991a:165).
The double-voicedness of the novels examined in this chapter is thus itself double: not only are they illustrations of how the voice of an individual interacts with the anonymous collective voice of a discursive system, they also stage the confrontation between the language of fiction and that of the human sciences which have the same object but different methods.
By articulating the fictional through the ‘scientific’, the novels question the authority of the latter and reassert the specificity of the former as a discourse which has as its function to mimic and to question.
3.1 Between: The Semiotics of Culture and Gender.
It will by now have become apparent that Brooke-Rose shifts her attention increasingly toward language over the course of her oeuvre .
This is particularly noticeable in Between ; indeed she herself says ‘it's really with Between that I discovered what I could do with language’(1989e:83).
In Out phrases of government jargon reverberate within the protagonist's mind and the multiple meanings of words generate associations which guide his train of thought.
In Such the dissection of conventional locutions is contrasted with the ‘transparent’ day-to-day use of language.
But it is in Between that the function of language to convey meaning is most actively questioned.
As we saw in chapter two, the number and variety of messages with which the main character is bombarded causes her to reflect on the role they play in her daily life.
I shall examine in this section the means by which different discourses and public texts are ground together to reveal the common structures that underlie them and the common strategies they employ.
With Between the relationship between language and gender becomes significant both thematically and structurally for the first time in Brooke-Rose's fiction.
Brooke-Rose started writing the novel in 1964, but she became blocked and eventually put it aside in order to write Such .
When she again took up Between in 1967 she decided to change the gender of the main character from male to female and ‘it suddenly worked’(1990c:32).
She suggests that this was perhaps because women have traditionally been seen as having a passive relation to language which is similar to that of a simultaneous interpreter who translates the ideas of others but does not produce any of her own (32).
Brooke-Rose acknowledges that this is a ‘cliché’, but claims that it was ‘true enough generally…for the purpose of creating the language of the novel’(1991a:7).
The language of the novel makes use of this cliché to demonstrate first that there is a profound ambiguity in the social construction of femininity according to which women are passive but at the same time subversive of the binary distinction which so construes them, and second that all people, male and female, are condemned to being at least partially the product of the language of others.
According to the gender stereotypes that permeate the novel, the mixing and crossing of multiple codes is a characteristically feminine approach to language.
By contrast, the (masculine) discourses of knowledge weaken symbolic systems by treating them as ‘true’: ‘our masculine-dominated civilisation…has turned vital lies into fragile truths’(175/569).
The female version of knowledge is characteristically an inversion: ‘our masculine-dominated myth turned upside down, in, out, around’(118/512).
A mock-textbook example drawn from a conference paper symbolizes the figure of ambiguity and multiplicity associated with femininity: ‘Comment on the gender of amour’(163/557).
Masculine in the singular and feminine in the plural, the word amour encapsulates a structure which serves as a model for the respective conceptions of unitary masculine logic and multiple, reversible feminine logic.
Linguistic and sexual terminology come together most often in the context of the Saussurian theorization of binary opposition, illustrated by an excerpt from a paper given at a conference on linguistics:
Et comme l'a si bien dit Saussure, la langue peut se contenter de l'opposition de quelque chose avec rien.
The marked term on the one hand, say, the feminine, grand e , the unmarked on the other, say the masculine, grand.
Mais notez bien que le non-marqué peut dériver du marqué par retranchement, by subtraction, par une absence qui signifie. (32/426)
Derivation of the masculine from the feminine ‘by subtraction’ sets up a logical opposition between positive, present feminine and negative, absent masculine.
This corresponds to the main character's own personal situation of being without a man.
But paradoxically, the phrase ‘une absence qui signifie’ is also used to designate her conception of herself as being without identity (which corresponds to Freud's characterization of femininity as a ‘lack’or symbolic castration).
An analysis of feminine and masculine symbolism delivered at a conference on ‘archetypology’ characterizes ‘inversion by double negation’as ‘typical of the imaginative function in its descending aspect of depth, night, femininity, container which becomes contained, swallower which becomes swallowed’as opposed to the ‘upward masculine aspect’(109/503).
Later the masculine myth is restated as a phallic ‘spiral…like a ziggurat or seven-terraced Tower of Babel’(139/533).
The inauguration of linguistic difference, associated with the Tower of Babel, is then typically masculine, whereas mythic ‘femininity’ subverts distinctions through inversion.
According to this scenario, the maintenance of oppositional structures is constantly being protected by the masculine aspect, while its feminine counterpart strives to undermine them, and even to undermine this constitutive definition itself by the use of reversible structures echoed in the novel's metaphoric construction.
The liminal position of the female voice with regard to the texts she translates provides an illustration of this ‘female’ tendency to undermine distinctions.
Like the Saussurian sign, she defines herself by and through her relations with others.
She feels she has no intrinsic self but only the provisional identity of the texts she translates.
Her role as a simultaneous interpreter is a hyperbolic figuration of the Barthesian character who is no more than the point of intersection of a number of different public codes (Barthes 1970b:74).
The absence from the novel of the verb ‘to be’ corresponds to this differential definition of the self that is no one thing but can say anything, and the ‘loss of identity through language’, which Brooke-Rose regards as one of the most important themes of the novel (1989e:84), is evident in the character's consciousness of living ‘between ideas’(19/413).
Though her job is to translate as faithfully as possible, this process is replicated in her mind by ‘bad copies’ in which analogous discursive systems are conjoined in such a way as to emphasize disparities between them or unexpected parallels.
Very often her ludic manipulation of language takes the form of intentional ‘errors’.
Multilingual puns are a favourite plaything of both her and her friend Siegfried.
When accused of using words ‘most imprecisely’, Siegfried replies ‘I use them simultanément’(36/430).
The subtle flaws inherent in any equation of equivalent terms becomes a generative device.
I demonstrated in the previous chapter that the use of discursive metaphor causes simultaneity and association to replace causality and linear chronology as the compositional principles of the novel, allowing changes of scene in mid-sentence and the coexistence of a number of often incompatible signifieds in a given signifier.
This process is described as ‘telescoping time with an error’(13/417,110/504), but it can also be understood as a creative transformation.
In The Dear Deceit mis-quotation generates an ironic effect of mis-contextualization.
The device of mis-quotation is used in a similarly ironic fashion in Between when an American character mangles a passage from Macbeth : ‘lirrechur, eh?
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, creeps in this petty place from day to day…’(35/429).
The act of quotation is a demonstration of supposed knowledge, an exhibition of what Pierre Bourdieu terms ‘cultural capital’; but here it misfires and the quoted text becomes the agent of parody.
Several pages later the central voice sabotages this transaction of symbolic worth by crossing the American man's substitution of ‘place’ for ‘pace’with a creative mis-translation:
I luoghi: Slowly now.
The places: La Francia, la Germania, e sopratutto la Britannia, la dolce Inghilterra….
Tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty luogo dove esplose il divorzio tra uomo e Dio….(41/435)
The ‘explosion’ in and of the sentence recalls the protagonist's lapsed faith.
In her mind she associates the act of translation with transubstantiation through a chain of associations (see 13/407,20/414,112/506,139/533,164/558), and the lapse in her relations with God corresponds to similar ‘flaws’ in her use of language.
The same metaphor is employed in The Languages of Love , but rather than representing tragic alienation as it does there, here it acts as a principle of formal and thematic patterning.
The ‘bad copies’ the main character produces are made possible by the fact that a number of comparable codes are juxtaposed simultaneously in her mind.
In an interview Christine Brooke-Rose illustrates the capacity for this type of juxtaposition to generate parody:
…when the Nixon pardon was announced on television…it said CBS special, you know, complete and free pardon, etc. and then, on the local station, ‘this program is presented to you by X, the deodorant that kills domestic odors.’
I just collapsed with laughter….
Maybe the announcer thought it was funny, but these things happen, the coincidences in life.
So that rather than doing what language is supposed to do, that bit of publicity, it does exactly the opposite.
You know, one whiff and it's clean, and of course with the Nixon pardon this is exactly what happened.
(1976k:15)
The semantic remotivation characteristic of parody is accomplished in this instance not by exaggeration, but by the repetition of an ‘equivalent’ message in two different contexts.
This technique is evident in Between , published six years earlier:
…the men in the café sit transfixed by the flickering local variation in the presentation of opposite viewpoints on every aspect of an instant world through faceless men who have no doubt acquired faces for them as their arch-priests of actualitá that zooms flashcuts explodes to OMO!
Da oggi con Perboral!
Lava ancora più bianco!
Gut-gut.
Più bianco than what?
We live in an age of transition, perpetually between white and whiter than white.
(24–5/418–19, cf. 38/432, 125/519)
For Bakhtin, parody and stylization objectify their target by introducing ‘a new semantic intention into a discourse which already has, and which retains, an intention of its own’(1984:189).
In the case of parody, this intention is ‘directly opposed to the original one’ and the result is ‘an arena of battle between voices’(193).
The ‘battle between voices’ in the above passage is not so much a semantic opposition as a fight for rhetorical supremacy.
Conforming to Genette's definition, the target is a specific pre-existent text incorporated literally into the parody (though in this case the original is ‘vulgar’ not ‘noble’).
Semantic inflation devalues the referential relevance of the advertisement's claim.
The comparative ‘più’ has no object; the difference between ‘white’and ‘whiter than white’is neither quantitative nor qualitative, it is a difference between determinate meaning and its abolition.
As with the misquotation cited above, the function of the advertisement is deflected: the text is made to refer to its own rhetorical device of washing meaning out of language.
It is also used as an agent of ironic comment whose target is the ‘actualitá’ of the news broadcast from which all distinguishing features have been purged.
The discourse of rhetoric (advertising) and the discourse of truth (the news) are implicitly equated through their juxtaposition, and the purgative action described by the one is operated on the other.
In Mythologies Barthes discusses advertisements for Omo and Persil in terms of the connotations they invoke.
He argues that the products are portrayed as chasing away dirt without harming the fabric:
…on met en mouvement la vanité, le paraître social, en donnant á comparer deux objets dont l'un est plus blanc que l'autre.
La publicité Omo …engage ainsi le consommateur dans une sorte de mode vécu de la substance, le rend complice d'une délivrance et non plus seulement bénéficiaire d'un résultat….
L'important c'est d'avoir su masquer la fonction abrasive du détergent sous l'image délicieuse d'une substance á la fois profonde et aérienne. (1957:39–40; italics in the original)
Indeed the advertisement cited in Between engages the central figure in a ‘mode vécu de la substance’.
She thinks of herself as a discursive fabric in which beliefs get lodged and are subsequently removed.
In an ironic vulgarization of Christian symbolism she is ‘delivered’ from her marriage, her country, and even her religion through the purgative action of language.
In order to get a job at the end of the war, she and Siegfried need to obtain what she calls a ‘Persil-Schein certificate denazifying us whiter than white’(79/473).
But the language she uses to describe this process demonstrates her parodic attitude toward it.
Like the implicit analogy between the Nixon pardon and a cleaning product, the comparison between denazification and the action of washing powder points to the arbitrary nature of the performative act and questions the authority on which it is based.
By tacitly demonstrating that the claim of denazification is no more legitimate than the commercial propaganda of television publicity, it levels them semantically and reveals the similarity of the linguistic techniques they use.
There is a fundamental ambiguity, however, in the protagonist's relation to language: the levelling of meaning and the abolition of distinction is at once the device used by parody and the effect it attacks.
The surfeit of codes and jargons in which she is immersed brings about a loss of faith in the power of the word, but her attitude toward the ‘instant world’ that is ‘whiter than white’because it has no memory and no values makes her uneasy.
Because of the inherently paradoxical nature of her existence, she is a representative figure of the ‘age of transition’.
As Susan Suleiman observes, she is an ‘emblem of our ambiguous present’(1989:127),
…on the one hand, close to being submerged by the detritus of civilization whose broken-up quality she both registers and exemplifies…; on the other hand,playing with that very sense of loss, that same detritus, and producing (sometimes) an exhilarating laughter.
(126; italics in the original)
The object of parody in Between is not so much theories and belief systems themselves as the linguistic manoeuvres by which they attempt to convince.
All efforts to communicate, whether in the context of a scholarly debate or a love-letter, are reduced to propaganda and rhetorical gimmicks designed to co-opt the truth in the name of patriotism, love, or science.
But in none of the above cases do the manoeuvres by which the main character resists her passive relation to language engage her in active polemic with other texts.
By making language do other than what it is designed to do in its original context, parodic manipulation undermines its illocutionary force rather than its explicit semantic content.
Though local assaults using pre-existent texts are not uncommon in the novel, they constitute a subset of a more generalized strategy described by Genette as pastiche and by Bakhtin as discourse with a ‘sideward glance at someone else's word’(1984:199).
Between is a hotch-potch of different ‘voices’ with degrees of autonomy ranging from direct quotation to the barely noticeable trace of the influence of a specialized discourse evident in a single word or the syntax of a sentence.
Most of the novel falls between these two poles: pastiches of learned vocabularies are interwoven with the ‘vulgar’ language of travel, and the effects this produces vary widely.
What joins the various devices under a common heading is the fact that in all cases the discourses invoked are spoken through by a voice which has little or no inherent identity of its own but is defined as a principle of interrogative conjunction.
This tactic of disarming a discourse by inverting it and tacitly denying its claim to tell the truth is implicitly linked to the feminine mythology that the novel elaborates thematically.
Linguistic posturing of this sort is the extreme reaction of a character in an extreme situation, but it dramatizes rhetorical manoeuvres available to both men and women who are forced into a position of discursive subservience.
3.2 Thru: Theories of Fiction and Fictions of Femininity.
With Thru Brooke-Rose turns from the discourses of culture in the wide sense of the term to the discourse of ‘high’ culture.
While Between explores the discursive role of women from a semiotic perspective and isolates characteristically female forms of language use which hold the potential for critical examination of our contemporary cultural ‘mythologies’, the object-discourses on which Thru works are those of which it is itself an object.
The same parodic tactics used in Between are evident in this novel, but transposed onto the self-reflexive plane of metafiction they become magnified, hence more overt.
Thru subverts the literary theory which has as its premise that every narrative contains a meaning and that this meaning can be accounted for in terms of a universal ‘elementary structure of signification’ which posits woman as an object of exchange between men.
The novel does to structuralist theories of meaning what Irigaray does to Freud's theory of feminine sexuality: it mimics them, draws out their implications and ultimately demonstrates their limitations, using the structures they propose as metaphors for personal relations.
In the early 1970s Brooke-Rose described the different ‘houses of theory’ she encountered when she moved to Paris in 1968:
Living in France…is rather like walking round a national exhibition, entering one fantastic and beautiful structure after another, the Lévi-Strauss Palace, the Derrida Daedalus, the Lacan Labyrinth, the Kristeva Construct, the Barthes Pavilion, the Planetarium showing the Sollers System.
(1973b:614)
She comments also on the ambiguous fascination these theorists exhibit with regard to their own practice: ‘it is all a beautiful, theoretical game, that they themselves don't perhaps really believe in, but indulge in it as one indulges in a passion, overwhelming at the time then looked at with mild amusement, a passion for beautiful systems’(614).
The characteristic stylistic tic ‘tout se passe comme si’ puts their discourse technically into the mode of the hypothetical or the fictional, reflecting ‘this curious paradox, the ardent desire for a system and the basic scepticism about all systems’(614).
The same ambivalence is evident in the prevailing attitude toward language.
Brooke-Rose follows structuralists and post-structuralists in their belief that language is the only tool we have at our disposal for apprehending reality, and that linguistic structures have a formative effect on the mind.
She concludes that an individual ‘can only protect his own patterning from the invasion of others by a kind of wild jay-walking among the traffic, trying not to get run over’(614).
Thru enacts this strategy of ‘wild jay-walking’ between theories by side-stepping their systematicity and making them into stories.
It shares with Brooke-Rose's 1960s novels the same basic technique of literalizing specialized discourses by means of a metaphoric mapping of one discourse onto another.
As in Between , the binary definitions on which structuralist theory is founded receive parodic treatment which voids them of their original function and uses them for the purpose of telling the tale(s) of the novel.
That this project is based on a ‘feminist’ logic is significantly more obvious in Thru , however, than it is in Between .
Thru models many of its narrative strategies directly on the writings of Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray, and more indirectly on those of Jacques Lacan and Jacques Derrida.
The status in the novel of the different types of theoretical discourse varies according to the degree of ‘internal dialogization’ these writings possess.
The novel does not question the concept of ‘theory’ so much as those theories which refuse to acknowledge the fact that they are ‘fantastic structures’in the mode of the hypothetical, and that their status as autonomous systems will always be compromised by their relation to their object.
In the case of narratology, systems which fail to recognize the fictionality inherent in their constructs and strive to maintain a rigorous distinction between ‘houses of fiction’ and ‘houses of theory’are subjected to subversive mimesis.
In what follows I shall analyse how one such theory — the narrative semantics of A. J. Greimas and the Lacanian theory of subjectivity with which it is associated — is ‘played with’ in this way.
The gender stereotypes inherent in binary definitions of ‘male’ and ‘female’are explored in Between , but structuralist theory as such does not come under attack.
By contrast, a keen awareness of the sexist bias of many structuralist theorists is evident in Thru .
In 1985 Brooke-Rose published an article entitled ‘Woman as a Semiotic Object’ in which she analyses the ‘deep, ancient, phallocratic’(1991a:249) structures for which thinkers such as Greimas, Lévi-Strauss, and others have an unconscious nostalgia.
Chief among these is the logical rectangle which Greimas sees as the ‘structure élémentaire de la signification’(Greimas 1970:160).
This ‘rectangle’ is composed of four arrows pointing diagonally outward from a central ‘O’to four corners which represent the four terms in a homology: A:B:: A':B'.
The deixes relate each term to both its contrary and its contradictory.
As a narrative paradigm, this diagram represents the exchange of an object ‘O’ between two ‘actants ’and two topographical sites.
Greimas maps onto his diagram Propp's basic narrative chiasmus: traitor ravishes king's daughter and transfers her elsewhere to hide her, hero finds somewhere king's daughter and gives her back to her parents.
Brooke-Rose's main objection to this model is that Greimas follows Lévi-Strauss in making of woman a silenced object of exchange whose signified has been repressed (ravished) into the unconscious (elsewhere).
This reflects, she claims, man's attitude toward woman in general, split between the ‘Pygmalion urge’ to form her to suit his own desire and the ‘demolition enterprise’(1991a:247).
She points out, however, that man's power over woman, like his power over language, is illusory, for ‘man thinks he shapes and masters and exchanges words and women, while all the time language is shaping and mastering him (and women), so that his exchanges and controls and double standards must be as mutable as language itself’(246).
The process of exchange, the underlying grammar of narrative so cherished by Greimas as a fixed structure, ‘must’ in fact be ‘mutable’.
Moreover, its mutations must follow those of language: when the functioning of language changes, so must narrative functions.
This hypothesis, although difficult to prove or demonstrate in the context of theoretical commentary, is dramatized in Thru , published some ten years earlier in 1975.
As in Propp's folktales, characters in Thru are variables while their functions are constants.
The principal characters, Larissa Toren and Armel Santores, teach literature and literary theory at two equally radical universities.
Similarly, the thematic structure of the novel vaguely follows Propp's paradigm: Armel takes Larissa into matrimony only to betray her; Stavro, a gallant but naïve young man, ‘saves’ Larissa, begging her to marry him and go with him to Peru, or: ‘The anti-hero anti-rescuing her from an anti-monster in an anti-romanzo’(149/727).
Yet as a tool for ‘de-coding’ literature, structural analysis is labelled ‘already out of date’(52/630).
Larissa talks of going beyond structuralism and goes so far as to disown it: ‘of course I am not a structuralist I never have been I merely played with it’(84/662).
Likewise, the novel plays with normative paradigms such as those proposed by Greimas which seek to standardize narrative by defining it according to a canonic conception of what a story is.
In the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Greimas, Todorov, Genette, and Barthes all argued for the autonomy of narrative theory with respect to its object.
According to this position, the aim of narrative poetics is to produce a typology which includes all possible narrative forms, not only those that have been realized in the past.
But Paul Ricoeur points out the fact that most such theories are simulations of our internalized grammar of narrative, which is based perforce on narrative structures that have been made common in the past (1986:139–40).
It follows that narrative poetics is in fact a form of historiography, a highly abstract story of stories.
Thru reveals that many structuralist theories of narrative are simulacra of the story we have all internalized of the constitution of subjectivity through the reification of women.
It also confutes their claim to completeness by staging narrative structures for which they cannot account.
This points to gaps in their typologies which indicate their dependence on a historically determined narrative competence.
The result is a ludic collapsing of autonomous theoretical systems on the basis of structural similarities or ‘slips’ from one to another which point to the common ‘story’underlying them.
Brooke-Rose distinguishes her novel from the plethora of ‘fiction about the writing of fiction’ in that its purpose is to play with ‘the reader's habit of trusting the reliable narrator’(1976k:4–5).
The reader's expectations are elicited only to be thwarted.
She explains that Thru is ‘a text that is really constructing itself and then destroying itself as it goes along…whenever I slide into a realistic scene…something happens later to destroy it, to show that these are just words on a page’(4).
In this sense Thru marks a break with Out ,Such , and Between which are all, in one way or another, attempts to create a textual equivalent of the experience of a single consciousness.
Brooke-Rose's encounter with Lacanian theories of subjectivity made it possible for her to relinquish her last link with realism by breaking with the notion of character as discrete individual.
The Lacanian split subject is from the start a discursive subject traversed by the other.
This splitting of the subject is literalized in the novel as a shattering of the narrative voice into a multitude of surrogate ‘bearers of the tale’.
Thru opens and closes with the central figure of the driving mirror or ‘retrovizor’.
The driving mirror is first and foremost an image: a self-reflexive representation or, in psychoanalytic terms, a narcissistic identification.
But the mirror has two characteristics that indicate those ways in which Thru goes beyond the self-reflexive novel.
First, the person who looks into it sees not only his or her own reflection but also the other cars on the ‘thruway’: the viewer looks ahead in order to see behind.
The self-reflexive text is thus also an intertext: it looks into itself and sees all the other texts of the past.
If this notion of looking ahead in order to see behind is understood temporally, it can be recognized as the constitutive structure of narrative itself, which Genette describes as a series of ‘déterminations rétrogrades’ in that the action of a story is a function of its outcome (1969:94).
This same structure is conflated in the novel with Lacan's model of the constitution of subjectivity.
In ‘Subversion du sujet et dialectique du désir dans l'inconscient freudien’ Lacan notes that the ‘fonction diachronique dans la phrase’is an ‘effet rétroactif’(1966:805).
He then uses this analogy with the sentence to describe the trajectory by which the subject constitutes itself through the other.
This is figured as a retroactive effect specifically linked to the mirror: ‘tout ce dont le sujet peut s'assurer, dans cette rétrovisée, c'est venant á sa rencontre l'image, elle anticipée, qu'il prit de lui-même en son miroir’(808).
The condition of anticipated completion in which the subject experiences itself ‘au futur antérieur’(808) corresponds to the movement of semantic retroactivity, just as the visual term ‘rétrovisée’ corresponds to the spatial image of the mirror — the two moments of this process being one temporal and the other spatial (806).
But the description passes through the curious term ‘[e]ffet de rétroversion’(808) which seems strangely out of place.
The word ‘rétroversion ’ can be understood etymologically as ‘turning back’, yet in modern usage it is reserved exclusively for the turning or tipping of organs, especially of the uterus.
One wonders why Lacan's narrative of the genesis of the subject has to pass ‘through’ this flaw in the female anatomy — a flaw in the ‘proper’functioning of the female body.
This leads to the second main characteristic of the retrovizor in Thru : unlike the Lacanian mirror, it is flawed, causing it to reflect not two but four eyes, two in their correct position and two further up the brow (1–3/579–81).
The rectangular figure which this creates provides a frame for the Greimassian narrative chiasmus in which the four eyes become four ‘I’ s or ‘actants ’.
It fuses this schema also with the Lacanian version of the diagram which Thru lifts from Lacan's ‘Séminaire sur ‘La Lettre volée’'.
Here the two ‘other eyes’(72/650, 146/724) are the locus of the ‘other scene’ or ‘elsewhere’.
The Greimassian chiasmus functions in a literal sense as the ‘elementary structure of meaning’ in the novel, organizing circuits of exchange on narrative, interpersonal, and pedagogic levels.
In each case the text has to ‘pass through’ this figure.
Being a discursive subject and speaking are a matter of having access to a mirror, and it is not insignificant that a male subject is initially in control of the retrovizor.
When one of Armel's string of mistresses is riding in the car with him, she notices the effect of the flaw in the glass and tries to appropriate this phenomenon of double retro-vision for herself:
She shifts the mirror to her rearward glance.
It doesn't work for her the mistress of the moment of sudden isolation at not seeing back to the black magician who fantastically juggles luminous hoops in the recto-rectangular hey put my mirror back.
So it needs adjusting.
(4/582)
The phrase ‘so it needs adjusting’ is an a posteriori justification for a failed narrative coup.
The narrative process the mirror represents ‘doesn't work for her’, she fails to see behind to the ‘luminous hoops’ of other subjects, which is a necessary condition for her accession to the position of subject of discourse.
She experiences a ‘moment of sudden isolation’ before her male companion demands that his specular image be restored to him.
‘Put my mirror back’ can be read as the cry of all men who have the narcissistic relation they enjoy with the image of their own desire threatened by a woman.
Nevertheless the flaw in the mirror suggests that all specular images are from the start marked by their passage through an ‘imperfect’ female discourse.
The reiterated question in the novel is precisely one of mastery of language: ‘Who speaks?’(1/579,22/600,42/620, 59/637,110/688,116/694).
This is largely a matter of narrative voice, but it is also a question of accounting for subjectivity.
It is Lacan's question in ‘Subversion du sujet’: ‘Qui parle? quand il s'agit du sujet de l'inconscient’(1966:800).
The unconscious ça speaks, to be sure, but the role of the Lacanian unconscious in subjectivity is complex.
The unconscious is ‘la place de l'inter-dit’, and the voice of the Other can only be spoken through the subject.
When this happens — and it happens constantly — the classical subject is eclipsed, it undergoes the effects of ‘fading’, and what is spoken is in fact ‘l'intra-dit d'un entre-deux-sujets’(800), a discontinuous, intersubjective voice (801).
In S/Z Barthes interprets Lacan's concept of the intersubjective voice in terms of narrative instance.
He argues that in the ‘modern text’ it is language alone that speaks: ‘Dans le texte moderne, les voix sont traitées jusqu'au déni de tout repère: le discours, ou mieux encore, le langage parle, c'est tout’(1970b:48).
But in a modern text such as Thru which mimics the classical narrator in order to counter classical conceptions of subjectivity and narrative voice, the narrator undergoes the effects of ‘fading’ peculiar to the traditional novel as well.
In the ‘texte classique’, Barthes argues,
…il arrive que…la voix se perde, comme si elle disparaissait dans le trou du discours.
La meilleure façon d'imaginer le pluriel classique est alors d'écouter le texte comme un échange chatoyant de voix multiples, posées sur des ondes différentes et saisies par moments d'un fading brusque, dont la trouée permet á l'énonciation de migrer d'un point de vue á l'autre, sans prévenir. (48–9)
The multiple voices in Thru do often suffer the effects of ‘fading’, they fall into the ‘hole’ that Lacan and Barthes refer to, the ‘blue lacuna’in the ‘delirious discourse’(14/592,26/604,54/632,59/637), of the novel.
For Emile Benveniste the peculiarity of ‘histoire’ as opposed to‘discours’is that it tells itself, no one ‘speaks’(1966:241).
Thru literalizes this defining characteristic of narrative by constantly thwarting the reader's attempts to assign the text to a given ‘voice’.
Because of the ontological indeterminacy inherent in the narrative, it is often impossible to tell who an interlocutor is, or whether a scene is being remembered or merely imagined by one of the characters involved.
It is even possible that either Armel or Larissa might be a figment of the other's imagination (8/586,26/604,53/631,91/669).
Matters get more complicated still when it becomes evident that a group of students may well be inventing them both as an assignment for a creative writing course, until the students admit that they too are ‘a pack of lies dreamt up by the unreliable narrator in love with the zeroist author in love with himself but absent in the nature of things, an etherised unauthorised other’(155/733).
The narrating instance is an object of exchange in Thru , indeed it figures in Greimas's diagram as an ‘O’(117/695).
It is a role passed from character to character, each of whom makes different use of it.
Though we often think we know ‘who speaks’, we invariably find out that we are mistaken when a slip in narrative level catches us unawares.
But none of the above-mentioned theorists works this logic through in terms of the male-female relationship and the respective relation to language of men and women; this is accomplished by Irigaray and Kristeva whose writings are interpolated into the novel, like the quotation from Shakespeare in Between , as the agent of parody rather than as its object.
While there can be no doubt that the polyvalent image of the retrovizor has its source in Lacan's article, a closer examination of the structure of the mirror image will reveal that it also resembles Irigaray's version of the constitution of the subject.
Larissa is described in her narratorial capacity as ‘some teller or Other’(27/605).
Her narrative corresponds to the ‘other eyes’ which have ‘psychic invisibility’(5/583,14/592,25/602,26/603,27/605,32/610, 107/685,120/69) and ‘reflect nothing’(5/583,72/650,120/698).
She writes to Armel that what matters in their narrative are ‘the innumerable and ever-escaping levels of Utterance by the I who is not the I who says I’ and she advises him to ‘read Irigaray’on this concept (53/631).
In the article ‘Communications linguistique et spéculaire: modèles génétiques et modèles pathologiques’ Irigaray traces the constitution of the subject not to the symbolic mastery of the mother by the child, as do Freud and Lacan, but to a recognition of the positionality of subject and object in language use.
This is only possible after the child has been forced to recognize itself as ‘il’, as an object of exchange between its parents.
This objectification temporarily reduces it to zero, to the
forme vide qui répond de la structure….
Impliqué dans la communication comme sa possibilité de fonctionnement, ce troisième nombre…est un blanc, un vide, le lieu d'une exclusion, la négation qui permet á une structure d'exister en tant que tel. (1966:17)
When the subject emerges from its temporary death into the position of the ‘je’ it can then assume a name.
The proper name thus figures ‘ce paradoxe de l'engendrement du ‘un’ á partir du ‘zéro’'(18).
But this ‘one’ of subjectivity is in fact double, for the subject experiences ‘la disjonction du ‘je’lui-même en (je), sujet de l'énonciation, et ‘je’, sujet de l'énonc é'; (20) the first of which is invisible.
The utterance is therefore always an enigma, a ‘rébus, où le sujet s'occulte’(20).
The specular experience recalls this passage through the zero by which the subject is engendered:
Face á son image le sujet s'éprouve comme situé au lieu de cette exclusion, non spécularisable….
Ainsi, l'expérience spéculaire est-elle réminiscence de ce passage par le néant que suppose l'introduction du sujet dans l'ordre du signifiant, figuré au mieux par l'imposition du nom propre. (24)
Irigaray's version of the specular (imaginary) experience corresponds to the flawed retrovizor where the ‘other eyes’ represent the non-specularizable ‘I’behind the discourse, the ‘other author’who is never present in the text.
This absence also figures the male definition of woman as lack, as an inverted image of man, as a hole in the male economy of signification (Irigaray 1974:57), or ‘O’(object and zero) as opposed to‘I’(singular subject and penis).
This might appear exorbitant, and indeed as a symbolic castration of the Oedipus complex it represents a partial subversion of Lacanian theory.
But there is ample evidence in the novel, in addition to the flawed mirror, to suggest that it is Irigaray's version, not Lacan's, that functions as Thru 's theoretical ‘deep structure’.
the Master (borrowed from Jacques le fataliste ) tells a somnolent Jacques about Kristeva's use of Irigaray's pronominal framework to describe the role of the narrator:
…out of the zero where the author is situated, both excluded and included, the third person is generated, pure signifier of the subject's experience.
Later this third person acquires a proper name, figure of this paradox, one out of zero, name out of anonymity, visualisation of the fantasy into a signifier that can be looked at, seen.
You should read Kristeva that's what she says.
(69/647)
Jacques's Master follows Kristeva in her argument that, just as the subject is eclipsed or subverted in the process of its creation, so the author must pass through the same ‘zero’ in order for the reader to be able to participate as receptor in the economy of communication established by the novel:
…the construction of a character has to pass through a death, necessary to the structuring of the subject as subject of utterance, and for his insertion into the circuit of signifiers, I mean the narration.
It is therefore the recipient, you Jacques, or anyone, the other, who transforms the subject into author, making him pass through this zero-stage, this negation, this exclusion which is the author.
(69/647)
It is at this point that the Master realizes that Armel Santores and Larissa Toren are near anagrams, except that‘I’ is missing from his name and ‘me’from hers (69/647).
The characters and their conjugal disjunction have indeed been generated out of a play of pronouns, out of‘words on a page’, for it is due to the lack they experience in each other that they are not able to constitute themselves through each other as subjects.
Irigaray's analyses of the use of pronouns by hysterics and obsessives (1966:29–31, 1967:55–68) reveal that whereas obsessives are unable to say ‘me’ because they are caught in a specular image of themselves in which there is no object, only an undifferentiated self (Irigaray's ‘on’), hysterics are unable to say ‘I’because they are unable to complete the trajectory through the other that would allow them access to full subjectivity.
It thus becomes clear that the play of pronouns in the chiasmus of the narrative circuit through which the subject plays out its split existence does indeed function as an ‘elementary structure of signification’ in Thru , though not in the way Greimas intended.
For a female story teller such as Larissa, the act of narration is therefore a risky proposition, for her story is always in danger of being labelled a ‘hystery’.
The ‘crossword’ on page 6/584 weaves together voices from a number of other texts in a ‘hysterical’imitation of male story-telling.
The uppermost portion of this page suggests the link between female discourse and fiction:
The message is enigmatic: ‘nevertheless this is not no the my/hystery of the eye’.
The ‘hystery of the eye’ is presumably a reference to Bataille's story ‘L'Histoire de l'oeil’, a story of enucleation, which is, of course in Freudian terms equivalent to castration.
The ‘Histoire’ of Bataille's title has been appropriated by the female voice which turns it into ‘hystery’— a ‘bad copy’of the original, and an enigmatic, repressed female story, a mystery.
The passage could be read as ‘this is not my ‘Histoire de l'oeil’, but a male story that I have been subjected to’, or as ‘this is not ‘L'Histoire de l'oeil’ but my story of the eye which is not a his-story but a hystery, i.e. a female story’.
The play of negatives: ‘never’, ‘not’, ‘no’, causes an additional ambiguity.
Is ‘no’ added to ‘not’for emphasis, or do the two negatives cancel each other out?
What precisely is being disclaimed or denied, the story or its possession?
Given the fact that insistent negation in dreams and the speech is interpreted by psychoanalysis as resistance to a truth which the conscious mind would sooner deny, are the negatives not perhaps to be disregarded altogether?
And given the identification in the text of ‘eye’ with ‘I’, the passage could also be read as ‘this is not the hystery of the I’, in other words: ‘this is (not) the (hi) story of a hysterical subject’.
Not surprisingly, this indeterminacy is itself the main characteristic of ‘hysterical’ discourse which is never willing to assert anything definitively (Irigaray 1966:29–30, 1967:67–8).
But if the move from history to hystery were simply a matter of role reversal it would be relatively unproblematic.
In fact, as the Lacanian schema indicates, the self and the other are caught in a more complicated relationship.
The relationship between Jacques and his Master is founded on a tacit agreement that the roles they occupy are the reverse of what they appear to be, but when Jacques tries to articulate this he risks losing his power which depends on its going unacknowledged.
Transferred to the realm of gender relations, this would describe the state of affairs in which a woman has influence over a man and manipulates his discourses, but is allowed this power only as long as she agrees not to flaunt it and remains in the position of silent partner with no autonomous voice.
She is then reduced to the unconscious side of man, his Other who speaks through him.
In Thru this condition is posed as a choice between two masters: ‘couldn't she be happy with y o u in the orbit of an eye and no referent without?
Or with the Other with he passed into hystery within?’(12/590).
Woman's inability to be content with either living in the orbit of the male ‘I’ or repressing her desire into ‘hystery’is a result of the fact that male desire is an essentially narcissistic ‘Pygmalion urge’to invent woman in its own image, while permitting the male subject the freedom to enjoy multiple reflections.
‘If the woman objects she is being hysterical and making a scene’(58/636), an accusation that is demonstrated when Larissa and Armel quarrel about his extramarital sex life and he tells her to ‘stop this hysterical rewriting of history’(76/654).
It is precisely this rewriting of ‘history’ as ‘hystery’that is forbidden to woman.
She is not allowed her own story, her version is by definition a retroversion, an imperfect, displaced version that appears in the wrong place in the mirror.
In a recent article on her fiction, Christine Brooke-Rose describes Thru as ‘the only truly deconstructionist novel’ she knows of (1988a:133).
By ‘deconstructionist’ Brooke-Rose does not simply refer to the fact that her novel ‘deconstructs’itself.
This it manifestly does, but it is aware that it is not unique in doing so (whence the many references to Tristam Shandy and Jacques le fataliste , archetypes of the novel that undermines its own stated project of telling a story).
Thru is ‘deconstructionist’ in the additional sense that it places itself in multiple positions within the field of literary discourse.
Not only does it constitute the object of its own criticism, it also contains a number of theories of this criticism, and in a recursive move that can truly be termed deconstructive, it presents criticism of these theories and it narrativizes this criticism.
Just as it collapses the hierarchy of narrative levels, so the novel un-builds the hierarchy of metatextual discourses that has come lately to encrust itself around ‘metafictional’ novels.
It does this by folding the entire structure back into the narrative.
What Derrida describes as the ‘double jeu’(1972c:14) of deconstruction is thus accomplished: the hierarchical relation between narrative theory and its object is reversed, and at the same time the subject-object relation is itself challenged, illustrating Lacan's widely disseminated dictum ‘il n'y a pas de métalanguage’(1966:813).
But if many of the theories with which the novel grapples have their roots in or near the work of Lacan, Lacan's text does not escape the double move of appropriation and subversion which characterizes the feminist enterprise.
Irigaray's strategy of mimétisme makes use of Lacanian conceptual tools simultaneously to appropriate and to undermine discursive authority (including that of Lacan himself).
It is for this reason that this approach proved so helpful to Brooke-Rose when she chose to turn her creative attention to narratology.
She too exhibits both a fascination and a scepticism with regard to structuralist theories of the text, manifest in Thru as a healthy mistrust of theory whenever it becomes over-systematic.
The subversive tactics deployed in the novel are a direct consequence of the male construction of gender roles within the discourse of narrative theory.
Both as social models and as models of narrative functioning, structuralist theories have gained wide currency within the institutional framework that determines how literature is read and the role it plays in society.
Thru demonstrates by means of a parodic conflation and manipulation of selected literary theories the problems inherent in such an approach to literature, and it uncovers the value-laden stories which subtend it.
3.3 Amalgamemnon: Women and Myth.
In Amalgamemnon the technique of mimétisme is generalized as the awareness of gender bias becomes more prominent.
If Thru may be read as a deconstruction of the androcentric preconceptions in the theories of certain structuralists,Amalgamemnon can be seen as a burlesque exposition of the procedures of exclusion operative in dominant versions of truth about the world, from the texts of antiquity to modern-day news broadcasts on the radio.
As Foucault and others have demonstrated, the interpretation of information in contemporary society follows a set of discursive criteria which determine what is classified as objectively true and what is seen as subjective opinion or fiction.
Amalgamemnon suggests that this split between fact and fiction corresponds to spheres of action and influence appropriate for men and for women.
Woman's domain is that of private relations and psychological matters, while men deal with the public concerns of politics and economic affairs.
Herodotus's Histories and Aeschylus's Agamemnon serve as touchstones for Brooke-Rose's novel, for in going back to the classical period, it is able to return to the point at which these distinctions began to be associated with different ways of talking and writing attributed to fact and to fiction.
The ‘hysterical rewriting of history’ of which Armel accuses Larissa in Thru is literalized in Amalgamemnon where the founding text of history is literally rewritten.
By selective citation the novel foregrounds the link between Herodotus's epistemological ambiguities and his ambivalent attitude toward the role of women in society.
Aeschylus's tragedy represents a loss of faith in the prophetic voice of women and the consequence of that loss for the Western discursive tradition.
The mythical story of Cassandra functions as an allegory for the fate of alternative forms of language use; truthful but ‘unheeded and unhinged’(12,144), the figure of Cassandra is an example of the extreme to which women's frustration at not being heard can push them.
The principal voice of Amalgamemnon is Mira Enketei, a university lecturer in the humanities who is on the verge of being made redundant due to the seeming irrelevance of her field in present-day society.
Her conjectures as to her possible future occupation lead to a number of wild escapades involving kidnapping and terrorism, as well as to more humble pursuits such as pig-farming.
These are intercalated with long nights of insomnia which she spends on the sofa with the radio and Herodotus, having fled her snoring lover Willy (later Wally).
In relation to both Willy and Herodotus, Mira sees herself falling into the role of Cassandra who was cursed by Apollo to have her prophecies ignored because she had refused to yield to his desire.
Cassandra's rage finds its outlet in the distortion of male discourse to the point at which communication falters.
She is described by the Argive elders as speaking in riddles because they fail to understand her predictions.
Clytemnestra thinks her mad because her exasperation at not being understood or believed drives Cassandra to a hysterical frenzy of gestures and grimaces (Agamemnon , lines 1061–5).
Amalgamemnon takes Cassandra's voice as representative of the way in which the discourse of women is seen by society at large.
‘Cassandra Castratrix’(119) is both the breaker of men (Cass-andra) and the powerless captive.
Not only do her efforts to assert her freedom from male domination lead her into the hands of another man, but she is also punished for her resistance by having her words deemed valueless, just as today ‘pseudo-escaperoutes will so lightly turn sado-escape, and…women's very freedom will so easily be used against them by even moderately clever men’(12).
Though women are typically characterized as prophets of doom, Mira's modest demand in relation to both personal and political situations is ‘let us recognize one another before annihilating one another’(15,136; variations: 20,74,136).
But it is suggested that even this is not possible, for in refusing to recognize their autonomy, men often effectively annihilate women from the start.
Mira's only possible recourse is to a parodic ventriloquy of male modes of communication which subtly undermines them by using word play to expose the ‘fictions’ that underpin supposedly objective information and ‘expert’analyses from Herodotus's time to the present.
From one point of view this is a defiant retreat into the ‘utterly other discourse’(5,15,143) of Cassandra who yields to her penchant for lexical distortion because she has been forced into an impossible position.
But it is also a vindication of the creative manipulation of language and a revalorization of the traditional relation between women and fiction.
The distinction between public and private spheres of existence has been used for centuries to exclude women from the activities through which larger social processes are effected; it has made of them goods to be protected, the stakes for which wars are fought by men.
This segmentation of spheres of action and influence along the lines of gender difference is reflected in the radio programming in the novel.
There is a sharp distinction between news broadcasts in which men tell the facts about the world and phone-in programmes run by women in which people discuss their personal problems.
When one caller transgresses this line of demarcation, asking the presenter Dolores what she thinks of a terrorists' kidnapping, she replies ‘That would be a little outside the scope of this programme Charlie, there'll be experts commenting again in the morning to tell you what to think of it, why don't you talk to me about yourself…’(80).
The realm of public discourse is that of events, expert diagnoses and scientific prognoses, whereas the private sphere is that of opinion and anecdote, subjective reaction, and cultural mythology which is devalorized by its implicit feminization.
In order to challenge this complex of interlocking polarities,Amalgamemnon goes back to a time when the two domains, though distinct, were not yet differentiated by separate modes of narrative, back to Herodotus, the first prose artist and ‘the father of fibstory’(22,113).
Out of Herodotus's attempt to distinguish truth from myth arose our own codification of discursive types, but in his text this structure is still in a state of flux.
Herodotus has long been regarded as a mythographer as much as a historian, for he records not just the bare facts, but the multiple versions of events he has gathered from a variety of sources.
Where these are lacking he readily substitutes rumours, conjecture and legend, as well as his own hypotheses.
The Histories is particularly relevant today because it represents the common discursive origin of historiography, sociology, anthropology, ethnography, and prose fiction.
Herodotus opens The Histories with a brief statement of intent:
Herodotus of Halicarnassus, his Researches are here set down to preserve the memory of the past by putting on record the astonishing achievements both of our own and of other peoples; and more particularly, to show how they came into conflict.
(41)
His aims are thus established from the outset both to record the evidence he has gathered and to evaluate it for the purposes of determining the truth.
But rather than starting straight away with ‘the facts’, he begins with the traditional account of the cause of the wars which he rejects because he has no way of substantiating it.
This is the story of a quarrel over women involving a series of abductions and retributions which culminate in Paris's kidnapping of Helen.
Herodotus cannot bring himself to believe in a story which gives as the cause of centuries of rivalry ‘nothing worse than woman-stealing on both sides’(42), for he does not think the Greeks could possibly have gone to war over anything so trivial, and indeed he appears to concur with the Persian view that ‘no young woman allows herself to be abducted if she does not wish to be’(42).
But this pre-history he rejects serves as a symbolic equivalent of the narrative of multiple usurpations and misappropriations of territory that occupies the following six hundred pages.
This is possible because in the cultural tradition of the West, as described and exemplified by Lévi-Strauss, the exchange of women is figured as the source of all exchange.
Herodotus's account of the ‘true’ history of the Medic wars can be read as an elaborate repetition or working out of the ‘truth’about misappropriation encapsulated in ‘fictional’form in the first two pages.
It is not fortuitous, then, that Amalgamemnon should begin its reading of Herodotus with a citation of the tales of abduction he himself rejects as fanciful: ‘Herodotus, the Phoenicians kidnapping Io and the Greeks plagiarizing the king of Tyre's daughter Europe’(5).
Like the quotation of Greimas in Thru ,Amalgamemnon 's abduction of Herodotus's text is clearly an act of retribution.
The word ‘plagiarize’(meaning originally ‘to kidnap’) makes this explicit: Mira denounces the sexist bias of The Histories by quoting the text selectively, cross-examining it, altering it to suit her purpose, and interweaving it with bits of the radio news.
Unlike many of his successors, Herodotus was a firm believer in the explanatory power of oracles, and he frequently cites their predictions in lieu of causal arguments.
But Amalgamemnon traces in The Histories a pattern of male appropriation of the oracle's discourse.
Either she is relegated to the status of mere spokesperson, transmitter of the divine logos of Apollo:
I'll know it'll be he who'll end up cassandring me, precisely in nomansland where the male gods will ever take over the pythian oracles, turning them into twittering spokespersons.
(136; variation: 14)
or she is in some way masculinized:
Pedasus will get warning of impending disaster through the priestess of Athene growing a long beard, I'll read to him to make him laugh and he will, and talk with his sidetrack mind….(14)
This juxtaposition of the myth of Athena growing a beard with the strategies Mira employs to bolster Willy's ego points to the fact that in each case a female voice transforms itself into a voice men will trust.
Woman's ability to assimilate the language of men and man's inability to fathom that of women is craftily demonstrated by a selective summary of Herodotus's account of the oracles of Dodona and his description of the Amazons:
And yet the story which the people of Dodona will tell about the black dove from Egypt becoming their oracle would surely arise because the foreign woman's language would sound to them like the twittering of birds.
And later the dove will speak with a human voice because of course the woman will stop twittering and learn to talk intelligibly.
Similarly the young Scythians will be unable to learn the language of the Amazons but the women will succeed in picking up theirs, and therefore disappear.
(11)
As Brooke-Rose observes elsewhere, the ancient oracle is the only instance of an institutional valorization of women's voice as truthful (1991a:241).
But by forcing it to conform to ‘male’ discursive norms, society succeeds in bringing oracular speech within the realm of ‘male’criteria of veracity.
The novel challenges this ‘amalgamation’ by turning ‘male’discursive strategies against themselves.
Amalgamemnon is parodic in Genette's sense in that it makes punctual and systematic alterations on a pre-existent ‘noble’ text of the past, and in Bakhtin's sense because with regard to sex roles its ‘orientation’is directly opposed to that of Herodotus.
As in Between and Thru , the works invoked are divided into agent and object of parody.
The voice of ‘Cassandra Castratrix’ is adopted strategically to perform an operation of creative mut(il)ation on the text of Herodotus.
This procedure involves two basic linguistic techniques: the anteriorization of discourse with respect to the events it describes, and lexical distortion.
First, the ‘true’ discourse of male authority is defamiliarized by being removed from the present and preterite forms of the indicative and transposed into the future, the conditional, the imperative, and the subjunctive.
In the interview quoted above, Brooke-Rose discusses her use of the negative in Between as a means of asserting and not asserting something.
A statement that something does not happen both creates an event and abolishes it in the same act (1976k:21–2).
Thru makes use of similar techniques at the level of narrative.
But the problem with this type of creation-as-destruction is that the negative aspect is easily equated with nihilism.
Moreover, the positive-negative opposition is inescapably binary, and any text structured on this polarity will be, like Thru , a constant oscillation between the two poles.
In Amalgamemnon Brooke-Rose gets round this problem by using non-realized tenses and moods.
The result is a text that operates in the mode of potentiality.
This is what Irigaray calls the hysterical ‘comme si’(1974:70), a caricature of the discourse of the (male) subject which is complete or ‘finalized’.
All ‘events’ in the novel are virtual; it is irrelevant to debate whether Mira imagines buying a pig farm with her severance pay or whether it ‘really’happens, because nothing is ever ‘really’accomplished.
In A Rhetoric of the Unreal Brooke-Rose cites Genette's claim that anterior time is a rarity in narrative, a mode reserved for subordinate accounts of dreams and prophecies (1981:329).
She says the reason for this is ‘the need to believe that the event recounted actually took place, or is taking place: no one believes a prophet, and even a prediction needs to be realised within the narrative for sense and interest’(329).
But she gives Maurice Roche's novel Compact (1966) as an example of a narrative which uses the future tense effectively for purposes other than prophecy.
In Compact the future entails a fundamental undermining of the reader's need to believe in fictional events…. the detail and intensity are such that we do believe that what is predicted not only will occur but is occurring/has occurred, while at the same time not occurring, abolished, a mere fiction of words.
(329)
Though she points out that Compact is not consistent in its use of the future, this description anticipates the development of the tense in Brooke-Rose's own novel.
Just as the constant circulation of narrative voice in Thru makes the reader at all times aware of the fact that the characters are just ‘words on a page’, so the use of the future in Amalgamemnon operates to maintain the reader's awareness of the fictional status of the events described.
The second discursive strategy used in the novel is the portmanteau technique exemplified by the title.
The combination of the words ‘Agamemnon’ and ‘amalgam’mimes on the linguistic plane the process by which Mira's Agamemnon, her amalga-mate, assimilates her to himself and denies her autonomous identity.
In an interview contemporary with the novel, Brooke-Rose explains that ‘Amalgamemnon is in fact about the violence which we all commit when we're always trying to amalgamate people and put them in a category’(1984b), but the novel also turns this strategy back on itself and uses ‘amalgamation’ to shatter categories.
The specificity of the lexical amalgam and its variation, the pun, is that they partake simultaneously of two different contexts which they join on grounds that are quite obviously a function of the free play of the signifier.
For Jonathan Culler, the pun provides a demonstration of language's inherent instability, mutability, and susceptibility to spurious motivation based on chance phonemic associations.
This last procedure, ‘the exploitation of formal resemblance to establish connections of meaning’, Culler characterizes as ‘the basic activity of literature’(1988:4), and it is in this sense that the pun can be seen as a cognitive model which accounts for the ‘literariness’ of even the most rigorous forms of language use.
Whereas in The Languages of Love the pun is indicative of the tragic breach between the human and the divine, in Thru it is described as ‘free, anarchic, a powerful instrument to explode the civilization of the sign and all its stable, reassuring definitions’(29/607).
The pun challenges models of cognition based on analytic reasoning and proposes instead a conception of language as a force capable of altering its object.
The fact that language can be used in this way as a political tool is a key to understanding the link between politics in the public sphere and personal politics.
In Amalgamemnon the pun and the lexical amalgam or portmanteau word work in the same way as discursive slips work in Out and mis-translation works in Between to create metaphors by revealing structural parallels between disparate discourses.
As in Between , this technique serves to map the terminology of geopolitical conflict onto personal relations:
And since even a polygonal story should have at least two sides in all international farewell orgies, how about packing it in and having a bash at normal behaviour eh, so as to get bashed again as whipping boy despite my morseled-out attempts to break free or go shiating on, turning the other cheek to sheer cheek as sitting target for the unclear missiles of affreux dizzy acts or as wailing wall of blame beyond the demarcation line or bowstring frontier that will boomerang back and much joy may it give me. (102)
Amalgamemnon 's conflation of these two domains through the transformation of language prefigures a possible transformation of the discursive systems which maintain distinctions between public and private, fact and fiction.
But on another level the linguistic acrobatics which the novel displays provide Mira with verbal strategies that enable her to cope with her fear for the future and her personal situation in the present.
In her relations with Willy she has constantly to choose between her ‘postface’ and her ‘preface’: ‘I shall put on my postface and mimagree, unless I put on my preface and go through the routine’(16,138).
The ‘postface’ is both a po-faced stoicism when confronted with male egotism and the face of ‘mimagreement’(14) whereby Mira pretends to allow herself to be amalgamated to Willy.
It is a ‘post’ face because it mimes the finality of male discourse, the self-assured certainty of the preterite.
The ‘preface’, on the other hand, is the language of the novel in which a statement is always a preface to that which it purports to describe, since only the language itself is ever realized.
If the ‘postface’ is the attitude of feigned female acquiescence to male views, the ‘preface’is that which objects, that which goes through the tiresome ‘routine’of explaining exactly why these views are objectionable.
The first attitude involves a conscious repression of her own identity on Mira's part, whereas the second attitude, though supposedly more contentious, often leads Willy forcibly to repress her ‘disagreeable’ qualities: ‘All my objections, which I'll put as genuine unacceptabilities of my cassandring person, which no man'll take, will be swept under his magic carpet with the ho-ho joke if no man will and I will, what am I?’(136).
Willy sees himself as the beneficent saviour who will ‘irrigate’ her ‘emotional desert’(17,138), and any attempt by her to suggest that she might be happier without him is ‘blackmarked against me as pretentiousness’(136).
Like the Trojans, Willy simply laughs away Mira's ‘cassandring’ voice.
The only viable alternative is to ‘mimagree’ otherwise, to mime agreement in such a way as to contest subtly the authority of the language used rather than launching a direct challenge to male discursive authority.
The fictional is a role Mira is forced into; she has no option but to tell a story about herself.
Yet if she plays at telling the truth, she also plays with the telling of the truth.
Willy's synthetic abstractions which generalize and falsify are countered by her analytic and critical re-writing of Herodotus.
By exposing the story of the silencing of women which underlies Herodotus's project, the novel demonstrates that ‘originary myths’ are at the heart of factual descriptions about the world, and that in this sense women, by virtue of their historical ties with the discourses of fiction, have a privileged relation to the voice of knowledge.
Luce Irigaray maintains that for her ‘l'enjeu n'est pas d'élaborer une nouvelle théorie dont la femme serait le sujet ou l' objet , mais d'enrayer la machinerie théorique elle-même, de suspendre sa prétention á la production d'une vérité et d'un sens par trop univoques’(1977:75).
One of the means she advocates for ‘jamming the machinery’ is the disruption of syntax (73).
This is because the ‘syntax’ of theory, the logic on which it is based, is at the root of structures which have historically been used to trivialize, marginalize, and devalue the discourse of women, to pass it off at best as a mere fiction, and at worst as an illicit form of language use or one in poor taste, like the pun.
If they are to avoid falling into the theoretical machinery that perpetuates such stereotypes, women are obliged constantly to dodge the conceptual apparatuses that seek to mould their language.
But this ‘jay-walking’ or ‘side-stepping’can result in unforeseen discoveries as the logic of juxtaposition, simultaneity, and other ‘lateral’processes are explored.
Rather than rejecting objectionable discourses past and present, this approach entails an unstable coexistence with that which it contests, and it manifests this textually as the parodic adulteration, manipulation, or ‘doctoring’ of another's language.
Between ,Thru , and Amalgamemnon exhibit an increasing awareness of the gendering of discourse — both the implicit gendering in Western culture of different modes of speaking and writing, and the explicit efforts by certain women to appropriate for ‘the feminine’ modes of language use that are inherently interrogative.
That there is a necessary link between this form of discourse and ‘fiction’ is grounded both in the historical links between them and in their contemporary utility as means of contesting the legitimacy of the language of authority.
The three novels chart an attempt to develop linguistic techniques which represent the current state of affairs and at the same time challenge it by enlisting subversive laughter as a tool to destabilize fixed systems and tear away their protective layers of discursive convention.
The concern manifest in these novels with the status of fictional discourse and its relation to the discourses of ‘truth’ lays the ground for the examination of the place of the novel in contemporary society which Brooke-Rose undertakes in the Intercom Quartet.
Chapter IV
Amalgamemnon ,Xorandor ,Verbivore , and Textermination : Technology and the Novel
‘I can imagine, I suppose, the binary languages of the computers making love to each other’(Brooke-Rose 1976k:18)
Amalgamemnon ,Xorandor ,Verbivore , and Textermination form what Christine Brooke-Rose has tentatively called the ‘Intercom Quartet’.
The Quartet picks up the novel where Thru leaves it, dissected and decentred in vitro , and returns it to the social and historical context out of which it arose.
The four novels deal with the status of the genre relative to the public discourses of the media and the discourses of specialized expertise in the domain of communications technology, both of which have become contemporary discourses of authority.
Each warns of the consequences of failing to recognize the merits of the novel and the fictionality of many of the non-literary forms of representation which threaten to supplant it.
With the Quartet Brooke-Rose moves away from abstract theories and scientific models as a source of new concepts and toward the consequences of the technological innovations which advances in pure science have made possible.
Her closer engagement with concrete social change has been accompanied by a rapprochement with the conventions of science fiction.
The Quartet is distinct from most examples of this genre, however, in that its focus is firmly fixed on its own status within a world which is increasingly under the control of non-verbal forms of communication.
But as the social role of technology changes, so must the genre whose task has traditionally been to keep one step ahead of science as we know it.
In an article on science fiction, Jean Baudrillard maintains that the traditional mode of the genre depended on a simulation of expansion that is no longer feasible in the contemporary world.
This is because all possible fictions of scientific progress are virtual in present-day technology which has taken over the function of ‘productive’ simulation.
The only recourse for science fiction is to turn to ‘simulacres de simulation, fondées sur l'information, le modèle, le jeu cybernétique’(1981:179).
The Quartet can be read as a ‘simulacrum of simulation’ in this sense: it reveals the simulated nature of the projections, speculations, and reconstructions fed us by the oral media and the role of story-telling in all so-called ‘objective’compilations of factual information.
Though the novels of the Quartet are linked by common characters and motifs, they cannot be said to have a continuous story line.
Their common concern is rather the effect of technological innovation on our thought processes and our ability to communicate.
Each in its own way, the four works examine the role of the novel in an age in which electronic networks have begun to overtake the printed codex as the archetypical manifestation of the word.
Though the novel is not the sole domain of either narrative or fiction, in contemporary Western culture it exemplifies both.
By foregrounding the historical specificity of novelistic discourse, Brooke-Rose is able to explore both narrative and fiction in what are, from the point of view of contemporary discursive categories, their most characteristic guises.
The distinctive features of the novel as a genre are three-fold: it is written, it is fictional, and its principle device is that of narrative.
According to this definition we are living in a particularly ‘novelistic’ age.
First, undecidability and paradox are the basis of the ‘new sciences’ which have made possible the technological innovations we currently enjoy, and written narrative is uniquely suited to accommodating logically impossible situations and mixing heterogeneous ontological postulates.
Second, even physics, the most rigourous of sciences, has recognized the fact that it is an elaborate fiction or secondary modelling system, not a recreation of its object.
Finally, it is becoming increasingly evident that scientific enquiry is an ongoing narrative through which generations of thinkers have sought to understand the world around them, and also that narrative as a mode of knowledge can be used as a means of accommodating the logical paradoxes of contemporary sciences.
But despite the widespread awareness of these three characteristics among those who analyse the practice of science, the institutions through which technological advances are implemented and disseminated tend to present the results of scientific research as facts or codified knowledge, ignoring their inherent paradoxes, their fictional status, and the cognitive evolution which made them possible.
In Brooke-Rose's view, the role of the novel as a self-consciously written, fictional, narrative genre is to remind other discourses that they too possess the same attributes of logical paradox, fictionality, and narrativity.
Furthermore, if we recognize that the discourses of codified knowledge are not fundamentally dissimilar to novelistic discourse, it becomes evident that the novel has validity as a cognitive tool which fosters individual creativity and interpersonal communication.
The ‘intercom’ of the Quartet's title refers not only to technological developments in information-processing systems, but also to how these developments have affected intercourse between individuals in everyday situations, and how this has in turn made possible a new role in society for narrative fiction.
In The Act of Reading , Wolfgang Iser argues that the literary work should be understood as a means of communication rather than as a representation of the world: ‘It is a vital feature of literary texts that they do not lose their ability to communicate; indeed, many of them can still speak even when their message has long since passed into history and their meaning no longer seems to be of importance’(1978:13).
But Brooke-Rose is careful to point out that a novel is not an act of oral exchange, and that most communication models are thus inappropriate to it (1991a:70–1).
The novel needs to be understood in the context of the modes of textual communication which have been made possible by the digital revolution.
With the advent of word-processing and other cybernetic-based means of producing and distributing text, the possibility for interaction between writer and reader increases, while the distinction between them becomes ever more blurred.
The text itself is transformed into a protean tool for unfolding ideas and responding to those of others.
Only a conception of the novel as an evolving genre will be able to take the potential of this development into account, and it is such a conception which the Quartet adumbrates.
Yet the Quartet also hints at the threat technology poses to the novel.
We tend to describe our lives using images from the conceptual languages with which we are most familiar, and the metaphor of life as a novel or the world as a book has yielded in contemporary culture to cybernetic models.
A fear that ‘techne…will soon be silenced by the high technology’(Amalgamemnon : 5) lurks behind the futuristic tales of these novels which echo the suspicions first hinted at in Out of the intentions of those who implement technological innovation.
In the pessimistic scenario, the writing of fiction is a last ditch effort to salvage humanist discursive forms.
The contemporary relevance of narrative fiction is one of the things that is at stake in the technological ‘revolution’, and Brooke-Rose addresses the issue from a perspective that is both sceptical and hopeful, ludic and apocalyptic.
In what follows, the three main attributes of the novel — its written, narrative, and fictional status,— will be treated in turn in relation to the four novels which comprise the Quartet.
Amalgamemnon inaugurates the theme of fiction versus fact.
As we saw in chapter three, it takes a historical approach to the origin of factual narrative (Herodotus) and the origin of fiction as discredited language (Aeschylus), comparing these to their modern-day equivalents in the oral media.
Xorandor examines the narrative aspect of the novel by exploring the theoretical problems of story-telling from the point of view of children whose minds have been formed by their exposure to computers; here techniques specific to narrative are shown to be central to even the most logical of sciences.
Verbivore focuses on writing as a form of communication: it posits a society in which writing has become outmoded and is then rediscovered, prompting a renewal of discursive modes peculiar to the novel.
Textermination examines the fictionality of the novel from the point of view of the reading process.
In all four novels the link between technology and narrative technique is characterized in terms of innovations in both areas which challenge the commonsensical conception of what is possible.
All four employ the variable narrative voice found in Thru , and Amalgamemnon ,Verbivore , and Textermination contain metalepses.
This return to the pre-nineteenth-century use of anti-realist techniques is accompanied by a recognition of the wealth of discursive forms which the more narrowly conceived realist novel has left untapped.
Changes in technology have made it possible to imagine means of communication that would have been unthinkable two hundred years ago: radio broadcasts, instant word-processing, telephone conversations, etc.
Brooke-Rose incorporates these into her novels but refuses to subordinate them to the narrative conventions of realism.
In so doing she demonstrates that the potential scope of the novel is enriched, not exhausted, by technological development, and that, conceived as an ‘open’ and heterogeneous genre, the novel still has a significant role to play in contemporary society, both as a mode of knowledge and as a means of communication.
4.1 Amalgamemnon: Fiction and the Media.
The genre of the novel long competed with ‘the news’ as a primary means of circulating information about the world, but its advantage as a source of entertainment as well as information failed to maintain its edge over the less demanding oral media of radio and television.
The novel then began to stake its claim as a genre which could give insight into the human psyche that no news broadcast or film ever could.
This led, however, to a drastic reduction in the scope of its subject matter and fostered the gender-coded distinction discussed in chapter three between the public sphere of events and discoveries presented as factual statements on the one hand, and on the other hand the inner world of psycho-social dramas presented as narrative fiction.
The consequence of this division is one of the problems Brooke-Rose set out to examine in Amalgamemnon :
…the crisis today is that we have fictions which no one admits to be fictions, whereas before people had myths, people had religions, and so on, and a lot of it was believed in as a matter of faith, whereas now everything is presented as real, and it is no more real than the myths of before.
(1987d)
As demonstrated in chapter three, the future and conditional tenses of Amalgamemnon put all ‘facts’ about the world under the sign of ‘fiction’.
If we follow Bakhtin in tracing the origin of the novel back to Menippean satire, this unusual use of tense can be understood as a typical novelistic device in that it brings the ‘completed’ past into the present and ‘contemporizes’it.
Amalgamemnon foregrounds the ‘novelistic’ aspect of contemporary society by using the future tense and other conspicuously fictional devices to reveal the speculative and constructed nature of the supposedly factual information conveyed through the media.
Yet Amalgamemnon is steeped in anxiety about the fate of the novel and other forms of individual creativity in a world of secondary orality where humanist pursuits are fast becoming obsolete.
It is not so much the production of the novel in the literal sense as its production in the social sense that is at issue.
There is a tangible risk involved in introducing a novel, and a difficult novel at that, into a world of instant accessibility in which fiction is discursively ‘redundant’.
Amalgamemnon takes the pejorative term ‘redundancy’ and uses it to fight the very exclusion it designates.
Redundancy is figured as an existential situation which is used to exemplify the condition of the humanist academic in an increasingly technocratic world.
The novel opens with the sentence: ‘I shall soon be quite redundant at last despite of all, as redundant as you after queue and as totally predictable, information-content zero’(5).
We soon begin to see the double-voiced nature of this supposedly ‘useless’ discourse.
The sentence is itself ‘redundant’ with respect to the opening sentence of Beckett's Malone Dies which it self-consciously imitates, and the implication is that all discourse is but a re-hashing of another's words.
In reiterating its own superfluity, however, Mira's ‘redundant’ language spells out the hidden resources of the novel's position.
Richard Martin shows that redundancy in Amalgamemnon functions as a catalyst for creative generation through variation and elaboration (1989b:180 et passim ).
There is also another sense in which redundancy is employed strategically.
In reducing the flow of daily life to ‘information content’, the mass media present as primary data a series of facts which have been culled through a complex process of information-processing.
Mira takes these facts and re-inserts them in narrative — not the original narrative representations from which they were drawn, for these are inaccessible to her,— but playful conjectures as to what might have been.
Logically Mira's version precedes the ‘events’ it details, for a narrative is always implied in a list of facts.
This discursive pre-emption is reflected in her use of the future tense which pre-dicts the story it relates.
She subtly contests the assumption that narrative fiction is ‘redundant’ with respect to‘reality’by grammatically inverting the relation of her stories to those she hears on the radio.
The discursive mode of Amalgamemnon is also plausible realistically in as much as the future and other unreal verb forms are commonly used in news broadcasts to describe scheduled events, to make meteorological and economic forecasts, and to speculate as to the possible consequences of events that have already taken place.
The voice of the future mimes the supposed experts who presume to know what lies in wait: ‘Soon the ecopolitical system will crumble, and sado-experts will fly in from all over the world and poke into its smoking entrails and utter smooching agnostications’(15), or: ‘The ecozoologists will then fly in from all over the world and poke its entrails and fraudcast a stooging diregnosis’(18).
But, as here, this mimicry often has the effect of comparing such experts with soothsayers, challenging the contemporary distinction between rational knowledge generated out of numbers and graphs and the irrational predictions of those who ‘fraudcast’ on evidence from stars or the entrails of animals.
De-realization is used to suggest that economic and other ‘scientific’ models are no more real (nor even more accurate) than the fictions and oracular pronouncements from which they seek to distinguish themselves.
Like the discourse of the realist novel, the discourse of the news media operates according to a specific set of technical conventions (reliance on the word of ‘experts’, abundant statistical and other quantitative information, scrupulous use of qualification, etc.) which guarantee that it appears truthful.
The stories Mira tells to divert her attention from her personal situation and to exercise her imaginative powers reveal the link between the conventionality of the supposedly transparent discourse of realist fiction and the conventionality of news stories.
She constructs out of bits of stories heard on the radio elaborate dramatic scenarios which parody genres such as the thriller, the spy novel, and the popular romance.
Imaginative story-telling thus represents an alternative to information, but also to the realist novel which shares the media's obsession with factual precision.
Her stories are a playful mimicry of the techniques of realist writers who use devices such as genealogical trees as ‘semiological compensation’ to help the reader assimilate the complex world they have invented.
Far from clarifying the world envisaged, these devices serve in Amalgamemnon to generate the fiction itself.
Mira starts by drawing a genealogical tree and then proceeds to invent stories to account for it.
She is eventually drawn into the stories she tells, and she is obliged to redraw the tree with herself in it.
Other metalepses include letters written to Mira by the characters she invents, and arguments with terrorists of her own creation.
By fusing news broadcasts with traditional novelistic tropes, she foregrounds the conventionality of both discursive genres and points to the fact that they both rely on an assumption of verisimilitude which her flagrant transgressions of narrative ontology undermine.
The voice of the media portrayed in Amalgamemnon is that of ‘afterthought’(21) which operates by ‘rearranging history past and present in the light of national self-esteem for political ends’(21).
Mira's dream is to get away from both this approach to the past and the alternative approach of realist fiction, to found a school of history in which ‘The highest marks will be given, not to the most correct which will be unverifiable but to the most ingenious’(21).
There she ‘could speak to an issue with a tissue of lies’(140).
This is an imaginary world where fiction would be indistinguishable from fact because, like the novel, it would be under the sign of potentiality.
In Amalgamemnon story-telling in the future tense is at once a reassertion of individual creativity and a counter-attack on the discourses of the media which ignore the fictionality of the material they present and the conventions which are at its source.
4.2 Xorandor: Narrative and Cybernetics.
The sceptical attitude toward information technology that surfaces in Amalgamemnon is tackled directly in Xorandor , but from a very different perspective.
The first thing someone familiar with Christine Brooke-Rose's fiction notices about the novel is that it reads almost like conventional science fiction.
The characteristic verbal acrobatics of Brooke-Rose's earlier work are kept to a minimum, and when they are employed they are always motivated in a naturalistic way.
There are two child narrators who work in tandem, but distinguishing between them poses no problem, and their identity is never overtly threatened.
As the novel progresses, however, it becomes apparent that Xorandor does in fact address many of the same concerns as Brooke-Rose's earlier novels, and that her assumption of the narrative idiom of the popular novel and her mimicry of a childish language are carefully calculated.
The seemingly ingenuous children discover that as a model of reality, narrative can have explanatory force to rival even the most powerful scientific theories, and indeed that narrative has many of the same characteristics as the concepts on which modern science is founded.
Furthermore, it becomes evident over the course of the novel that the story of this founding is itself illuminating in the context of contemporary scientific practices.
Xorandor is a tale set in the near future of two twelve-year-old fraternal twins called Jip and Zab who find a talking stone at an old carn in their native Cornwall.
They discover that although the stone is capable of communicating on ‘vocal’, its more natural medium is ‘softalk’, or direct interface with their pocket computer.
They call the stone Xorandor but, still half believing it is the ghost of Merlin, they amuse themselves teaching it to speak their own peculiar cybernetic slang.
Their secret is soon discovered, however, when the local nuclear waste storage facility where their father works as a physicist records mysterious disappearances of radioactive materials.
Xorandor explains that he lives on radioactivity, that he has come from Mars in search of food, and that he has been stealing the waste to feed himself.
His consumption of nuclear waste would seem at first to be an ideal solution to the problems of both Martians and humans, but of course there is a hitch.
Xorandor has inadvertently eaten a dangerous isotope which has caused a ‘syntax error’ to occur in one of his offspring, Xor 7.
This mutant stone takes over a nuclear reactor and threatens to blow the reactor up if he and his race are not permanently supplied with ‘high quality food’.
Only the twins are able to convince the terrorist stone to renounce his plan, yet once the crisis has been averted they are sent off to school in Germany.
When they are finally allowed to return a year and a half later, they discover that Xorandor and seventeen of his children are under close surveillance in different parts of the world, but that he has ‘programmed’ them to escape and neutralize nuclear missiles.
The governments of nuclear-armed countries rightly perceive this as a threat to their defence strategies and decide to send all the stones back to Mars.
Though Xorandor resigns himself to his fate, he tells the children a secret: he has not in fact come from Mars at all but is a member of a race that has been living on Earth for millions of years, communicating over vast distances through radio pulses in binary code.
He has broken his age-long silence in order to warn humankind that he has committed a dangerous ‘syntax error’.
Or perhaps he has intentionally made the ‘syntax error’ in order to alert people to the danger of their nuclear inventions.
The question is never resolved, but neither is it a new question.
Did Christ come to save man from his original sin, or did man commit his felix culpa in order to be redeemed by and in Christ?
Though the ‘facts’ of his existence are ultimately undecidable, as a ‘story’the information Xorandor conveys makes sense.
Jip and Zab criticize the scientists who analyse Xorandor for their obsessive concern with his ‘synchronic’ functioning to the exclusion of his ‘genealogy’(60,191).
They, who know his ‘true’ history, are the only ones to grasp the significance of origins and myths of origins.
Like narratology, cybernetics takes linguistics as its model discourse, and the analogy between narrative and programming provides the underlying conceit of the novel.
As computer whizzes, the twins' main expertise is the logic of programming languages, so it is natural for them to discuss story-telling in terms of program-writing.
They discover, however, that the logic of narrative is far less rigorous and relies far more on individual taste: ‘…it seems harder to tell a story, even our own, than to make up the most complex program.
Or at least to choose how to tell it’(8).
They complain that ‘even with hindsight we can't decide what's really relevant and in what order’(35), which causes problems with ‘sequence-control’(23,28) because of‘spaghetti stacks’(poorly ordered sequences of instructions, 12).
They also criticize each other for including ‘waste instruction[s]’(8).
The narrative method they eventually choose is ‘dialogic’ in the most literal sense, for together they dictate the story directly into their computer.
The twins' ignorance of narrative technique stems from a change in education which has been brought about as a result of the increasing dominance of science over the humanities.
In the society they inhabit they will have to choose at the university level between physics and hi-tech; philosophy and literature may be pursued only as hobbies.
Zab wants to study both physics and philosophy ‘As it used to be’(187) in Aristotle's day.
The novel represents an attempt to bring these two domains back together through the common discursive mode of narrative.
Far from being a romantic reaction against science, this represents an effort to make people recognize that the scientific concepts which permeate our society have implications far beyond the immediate domain of their technical application, and that they are rooted in seemingly more primitive modes of thought such as story-telling.
Xorandor's principal strategy for communication, which the children term ‘play-acting’, is, like theirs, an ad hoc narrative technique:
As mothers with children, and sometimes women with their men.
Xorandor doesn't laugh at people, he goes along with them at their level, telling them what he knows they want to hear.
After all, we all play language-games…
And what started as a language-game had to go on as a lie, or a myth.
(190)
He simulates the picaresque ingenuousness of the alien, pretending to learn English from the children in order to gain their confidence, and gradually modifying the historical account he gives of himself to meet peoples' changing conception of him.
Near the end of the novel Jip and Zab discuss the status of what Xorandor has told them, whether or not it is the truth, and how they can be sure.
But as they analyse what he has said to different people, they begin to see that the question is not really pertinent.
They realize that in every case he has answered people's questions according to their particular logic.
Thus when the postmistress asks him if he has come from Mars, he answers ‘yes’ because she has just told him the story of Merlin that is a local myth.
His ‘myth’ has the same status as hers, though later when scientists attempt to verify this he has to alter the chemical composition of his exterior in order to substantiate his claim.
He has ‘told a story and altered his reality to fit’(186).
As in Amalgamemnon , there is a blurring of the distinction between ‘originary myth’ and ‘truth’.
As Peter Brooks argues in Reading for the Plot (1984), narrative is a mode of explanation used when other forms of logic break down, in the case of insurmountable contradictions, undecidability, or other seemingly irrational states of affairs.
Because narrative is able to cope with these problems, it is often enlisted by the human mind to work through logically impossible situations.
It is also the communicative technique Xorandor uses to smooth over the paradoxes inherent in his make-up.
One of the first things the children notice about the stone is his odd logic.
Because he ‘fails’ to grasp the concept of pronouns as shifters (the understanding of which is, in Irigaray's terms, the necessary condition for entry into the discourse of the symbolic), they term him ‘slow’(16).
But when he does eventually ‘learn’ the concept, they concede that ‘Even now it still seems as if his sense of identity is quite different from ours’(17).
They name him Xorandor because they notice that ‘His logic could be both absolutely rigorous and absolutely contradictory at crucial points, some arguments could be both XOR and AND, or XOR and OR’(18).
These are terms used in digital electronics to designate the basic logical operations on which digital systems are founded.
The terms, derived from the concepts of Boolean algebra, correspond to specific types of logical operators, or gates, in an integrated circuit.
In an OR gate (also known as inclusive or) an initial input of two binary terms will yield one if either or both of the terms is one.
In an XOR gate (exclusive or) the output will be one if either but not both of the initial terms is one.
An AND gate will yield one if and only if both initial terms are one.
In all other cases the output is, of course, zero.
Xorandor's logic transgresses that of binary systems because he combines mutually exclusive operations.
When the children ask him why he has contacted them, he replies: ‘for security and insecurity xor insecurity andor communication’(81).
His paradoxical logic is in many respects similar to the non-binary logical structures developed in France in the late 1960s to account for the peculiarities of literature and of narrative in particular(see section 3.2 above).
But there is also another sense in which narrative is pertinent to the concept of undecidability, for the narrative of cybernetics as a field of study has this concept at its source.
Jip tells of something he has seen written on a wall: ‘If the human brain was simple enough for us to understand we'd be so simple we couldn't’(88).
Zab pipes in with the comment: ‘Why, it's a popular version of the Gödel theorem’(88).
She goes on to link Gödel's theorem to Alan Turing's proof that ‘no machine could…completely understand itself, I mean, tackle all its own problems’(88).
In 1936 Turing succeeded in demonstrating that there are undecidable problems which no algorithm can solve.
He did this by means of a conceptual prototype of the modern computer which was in effect a definition of the algorithm (Stewart 1987:214–18).
The concept on which computing is based thus contains an element of the indeterminate: the history and origin of computers is inextricably linked to the discovery of ‘originary’ undecidability.
But this history is easily overlooked, as is the modern computer's capacity to accommodate ‘semantic’ undecidables, in scientists' eagerness to construct a myth of the internal consistency and autonomy of their discipline.
Jip and Zab's father claims that computer logic, unlike human logic, ‘can't cope with a word used in a figurative sense, or with humour, which depends on wordplay, which is like assigning two values to a character’(87).
The twins point out that this conception of polysemy has only limited applicability, for it does not explain ambiguity caused by contextual factors.
Xorandor is capable of wordplay, he even puns on Shakespeare: ‘softwarily we are observed’(179), and he gives a reply to one of the twins' questions that they later discover to have been ‘syntactically clear but contextually ambiguous’(183–4).
They then realize that not only is this type of undecidability possible in Xorandor's logic, but that it is also the founding condition of their binary systems.
Even in their own computer in a context-free grammar no general procedure exists for determining whether the grammar can be ambiguous in any one of every single case, however long one ran the program.
The question is then said to be undecidable. (182)
Xorandor is not in fact an alien creature from another planet; likewise, his seemingly irrational logic is implied by their own.
In their encounter with Xorandor, Jip and Zab discover a race that is radically ‘other’ to their own conception of life, a race that, though voiceless, and apparently powerless, nevertheless surpasses humankind in cognitive capacity: ‘…their life-purpose, their survival kit, seems to have depended on silence — not to each other but towards us, though they learnt from us and went beyond us’(192).
They recognize that even the most basic logical processes involve an element of indeterminacy; they also base their techniques of communication on the strategies of narrative fiction rather than the endless flow of information.
Inventing the past to suit our needs, telling stories to account for paradox, and acting out roles are the forms of narrative which make possible all our cognitive endeavours and all communication.
Modern science ignores this at its peril, and Xorandor may be read as a fable for scientists and would-be scientists, written in their own idiom, warning them of the consequences of cutting their project off from its conceptual genealogy, its own founding story.
4.3 Verbivore: Writing and Communication.
Like Xorandor , its sequel Verbivore examines the social and discursive implications of present-day technology by postulating the consequences of a radical variation on communication as we know it.
In Verbivore the focus is switched from the principles on which high technology is based to the media through which it is transmitted.
Recalling Marshall McLuhan's dictum that ‘the medium is the message’, the novel posits the possibility of an obligatory shift in the primary medium of communication from oral and cybernetic forms to a ‘secondary literacy’ in which the world is required once again to rely on the written word.
The consequences of this shift for people's habits and thought processes provide both the subject-matter and the technique of the novel which is composed entirely of people's written accounts of their experience of the crisis.
As in the first modern novels of the eighteenth century, technical experimentation in Verbivore is closely linked to generic conventions specific to the written text.
It is the interaction of high technology with traditional novelistic modes which is the focus of the work.
Of the four volumes which comprise the Quartet, only Xorandor and Verbivore have directly related story lines (though characters from Amalgamemnon surface in both Verbivore and Textermination , most notably perhaps, Mira in the role of narrator).
Verbivore takes place twenty-three years after the action of the previous novel.
The twins have gone their separate ways and become estranged: Jip is a nuclear physicist at NASA and Zab is a Euro-MP in Aachen, which has become the new seat of the European Parliament.
Since the adventure of their adolescence, they have had no contact with their mineral friends whom they have all but forgotten.
But strange occurrences prompt them each to wonder whether Xorandor's progeny may not again be interfering with human activities.
The story starts with various accounts of what journalists have dubbed ‘Verbivore’, an unexplained phenomenon in which the modulations of electromagnetic waves are being mysteriously ‘flattened’ by some unknown agent.
At first the cuts are only occasional, but they become increasingly common until finally all signals have disappeared from the airwaves.
Radio, television and the radar-dependent navigational devices of planes and other vehicles are affected, as are computer networks and satellites.
The economy comes to a virtual standstill as the population is forced to turn to print and writing for communication purposes.
Sensing that the stones may be at the root of the problem, Zab contacts one of Xorandor's offspring, and she learns that ‘Verbivore’ is a reaction by the mineral race to information overload.
Because it cannot cope with so many messages, its only recourse is to sabotage the airwaves themselves.
Aided by Jip and their old friend Tim who is now head of the BBC, Zab acts as an emissary between humans and stones and strikes a deal: people will voluntarily agree to curb the amount of material transmitted if the stones will agree to stop their interference.
Yet as with many agreements on environmental pollution, voluntary abstention is unsuccessful.
After an initial period of relative restraint, people return to their former prolixity and the novel ends with ‘Verbivore’ being resumed for good.
Verbivore starts and ends with Mira as narrator.
Like several other story-tellers active in the novel, she includes in her narrative bits and pieces of what she reads and hears around her.
In the opening pages she interpolates a radio play called ‘A Round of Silence’ by Perry Hupsos (a character she invented as a radio presenter in Amalgamemnon (74) out of the title Peri Hypsos (Longinus's On the Sublime )).
The play functions as a mise en abyme of the novel as a whole.
Two of the main characters are Julian, who is writing a thesis on ‘neopostdeconstructionism’, and Decibel, a voice he hears inside his head when he is recovering in hospital from an accident.
Julian cannot tolerate noise, while Decibel cannot live without it.
This much is established in the play, but, unable to think of a suitable ending, Perry anticipates the events to come by aborting the drama prematurely with a radio cut written into the script.
The two characters continue to appear throughout the novel, however.
It becomes evident that Julian is a representative figure of the writer when he decides to write a novel (82), and Decibel that of the oral media when she declares writing to be her natural enemy (186).
Though they are opposing principles, Julian and Decibel need each other.
Julian is aware of his status as a character in a radio play, and he laments the paradox whereby he hates noise but relies on being broadcast in order to exist (113).
Decibel is an oral character in the sense that she is part of a play, but she has nevertheless been conceived of and written by Perry.
This opening parable may be read as an allegorical figuration of the main idea behind the novel: written and oral means of communication are interdependent in the modern world.
Certainly Verbivore is characteristic of its cybernetic times in that it is more ‘user-friendly’ than much of Brooke-Rose's previous work.
Linguistically it is even more straightforward than Xorandor ; the twins have largely abandoned their cybernetic slang (though they fall back into it when excited), and while frequent, multilingual puns are always motivated realistically.
The novel can plausibly be labelled science fiction by virtue of the fact that it takes place in the future and involves ‘alien’ life forms, but the use of science and other specialized discourses is kept to a minimum.
From this perspective Verbivore is the most accessible of Brooke-Rose's novels since The Middlemen .
It nevertheless refuses to conform to the narrative conventions of nineteenth-century realism.
Instead it takes as its model the typically eighteenth-century genres of direct discourse: the epistolary novel, the journal novel, and the fictional autobiography.
By developing these devices in the light of modern technology, Brooke-Rose is able to circumvent the conventions of realism while still remaining within the bounds of what is accepted as novelistic.
The intimate relation of the novel as a genre to the written word is evident in its historic evolution out of letters, diaries, and autobiographical accounts.
In the eighteenth century the first modern novelists recognized that these genres could be used to tell a story.
The conceit of the ‘found document’, discovered, preserved, and presented to the public by an ‘editor’ was a justification no longer necessary in the nineteenth century when the novel was firmly established as a genre.
It is at this point that the historical link between the novel and the written text began to be lost sight of; the highly unrealistic convention of the omniscient third person narrator then became a realist norm.
But because the novel is still a written genre, it is threatened by the rise of ‘secondary orality’.
The onus is on writing as a medium to demonstrate that it is capable of forms of communication which are impossible in the oral media, and that it therefore still has a place in contemporary society.
The specific effects of the written text have been the preoccupation of literary theory from Derrida and Barthes onward, and the writerly nature of the novel has often manifested itself in the form of typographical devices which defy oral utterance or those specific to the codex.
This is the approach taken in Thru where ‘concrete prose’ is used to exploit the possibilities of the printed word, creating a text that is ‘unspeakable’by virtue of the fact that it relies on visual as well as auditory performance.
But concrete prose is borrowed from concrete poetry as practised by Carroll, Mallarmé, Apollinaire, and others; though it is a form possible only in written texts, it is not one specific to the novel.
In Verbivore Brooke-Rose makes use of techniques that are possible only in prose narrative: the mixing of documentary-like realism with ‘events’ which are unthinkable from a visual or aural point of view, and the circular embedding of narrative fragments.
Verbivore combines the fantastic ontological postulates of Amalgamemnon with the basically realistic postulates of Xorandor , creating a hybrid form which can be likened to magic realism as practised by many Spanish-American writers, and more recently by a number of British authors.
The characters from the two novels carry their ontological status with them and pass it on to those they engender.
Thus Perry, Julian, and Decibel are ‘unrealistic’ characters.
Julian is aware, for instance, that he is a character in Perry's play; Decibel is the personification of an abstract quality.
When at one point Decibel meets Zab, Zab wonders if she must not be dreaming.
She relates her ‘dream’ to Jip and he confirms her interpretation of the episode, for in their realist world, ‘only dreams mix real and fantasy items’(139).
This is a classic case of dramatic irony which alerts the reader to the fact that novels too are capable of mixing fantastic and realistic elements, that indeed the capacity to do so is one of their defining characteristics.
The imagining of what someone else is writing is the mechanism by which the novel switches from one first-person narrator to another.
Mira imagines what Zab must be typing into her word-processor; soon we are reading Zab's text in which she imagines what her brother Jip is typing, and so forth, through their mother Paula, the playwright Perry Hupsos, his characters Decibel and Julian, and finally back to Mira.
While the effect is a variation of point of view, the structure is that of a ‘strange loop’— by definition a transgression of conventional ontology — which works itself through several narrative levels.
Just as the ‘Verbivore’ phenomenon is caused through a flattening or levelling of the modulations of air waves, so the hierarchy of narrative levels is ‘flattened’such that it becomes impossible in any given instance to determine whose account we are reading or whose mind we are supposedly ‘inside’.
As in much self-conscious fiction, we are constantly being reminded of the fictionality of the novel, but Verbivore makes it clear that this fictionality also applies to the ‘simulations’ of the media which its ‘fictions’purportedly replace.
Far from enabling true communication, ‘communications’ networks process information which is immediately outdated, and can therefore never claim a response.
In Verbivore people's dependence on the endless flow of facts and interpretation has reached the proportions of an addiction to ‘that best narcotic, vox humana’(31).
As Mira sees it, this form of language use has had an indelible effect on human consciousness:
our minds and psyches, our entire nervous system and networks of expectations have been transformed by the media.
…We depend on the media for our life-blood, the stream of information, the adventures, the violence, the romance,…the eternal commentary that lines our lives like a loving companion, a double, making sense of it for us. (30–1)
The ‘eternal commentary’ or ‘double’is absorbed in a one-way continuous-feed process which has replaced dialogue.
This is a sinister view of the world of simulacra and simulation described by Jean Baudrillard, the world in which people have the illusion of being actively hooked into vast information networks, whereas in fact they are only the passive recipients of processed data, more and more isolated in front of their televisions and their computer screens (1970:186–91, 1981:121–31).
It can also be likened to the world envisaged by Hassan's ‘new gnostics’, who see the future as a vast network of information systems produced, as Brooke-Rose points out, by the few for the many (see section 2.1 above).
At one point Zab asks: ‘What have we lost…since the disappearance of books?’(38), and as if in reply, Tim describes cybernetic abstractions as the cause of mental and physiological degeneration: ‘We've become stunted human beings.
Loss of senses and muscle through the media, loss of memory and logical capacity through computers’(92).
Indeed, Jip and Zab have lost their almost telepathic ability to communicate, and, as witnessed by the outcome of the novel, the world is unable to communicate well enough to reach a full consensus or enforce a communal decision.
Simulation has also begun to supplant individual creativity.
Being an inveterate story-teller, Mira is quick to remark on the degenerate effect the dominance of the media has on personal development: ‘Gradually all our secret treasures have been removed and we've all been made to share the same abstracted and alienating public knowledge’(111).
According to Tim, this has resulted in a return to an élitist society in which ‘The population has learnt to live on abstractions and interpretations of the world as presented by a few’(92).
With the advent of Verbivore, however, people are forced once again to rely on their own cognitive and creative resources.
It is not long before their imaginative faculties are reactivated and word-processing becomes a universal withdrawal symptom.
For lack of information about what is happening elsewhere in the world, people record ‘screendiaries’ or ‘mimic minimemoirs’(7) on their ‘chatterscreen[s]’(127).
Not only do they write of their personal experiences, speculations and fears, they also begin to imagine what people they know are thinking, saying, and most of all, what they are typing into their word-processors.
This spontaneous surge of ‘substitute fictions’(169) is commented upon by many of those who take to keeping computerized journals.
Zab finds herself using the now obsolete narrative conventions of the memoir.
She notes that ‘clearly I am deriving pleasure, just as fiction-writers used to, from the mere fact of noting facts’(37).
When it comes to her imagined transcriptions of Jip's diary, she goes on in the same descriptive vein for a paragraph, then stops herself with an abrupt exclamation of ‘No, he wouldn't say all that’(54), whereupon she starts again in more concise fashion.
Jip, for his part, imagines his mother Paula writing and then he catches himself and reflects on his motives:
…why am I writing all this out as if I were trying to assimilate myself to her?
Are these increasing breaks in our daily fictions turning us all into d.i.y.
fiction producers?
Which, Zab would cut in, we've all been all along anyway, but in our heads, not on paper.
(75)
Paula (who writes in long-hand) reflects in turn on the genre of the journal per se :
Why am I scribbling all this to myself?…
Perhaps I'll send these pages to Zab for comment.
I've certainly never kept a journal before, it's not the age of journals.
…Perhaps everyone will now, it's catching.
(79)
As these passages demonstrate, the passive consumption of information and oral commentary is contrasted with characteristically written forms of language use which encourage intersubjective communication by forcing people to imagine, in the case of the journal, what others are doing or, in the case of the letter, how they will react to what is being written to them.
This active projection of consciousness outside the self is the condition of true communication, and also the condition of the creation of narrative fiction.
But just as the invention of print prepared the way for the traditional novel (Watt 1957:196–200, Couturier 1991:93–144), so the fictions characters produce in Verbivore are conditioned by the technological advances which have made them possible.
Taking a broader perspective, Mira remarks on the situation at large.
She notes that there is a difference between the stories people have been producing and traditional fiction.
The facility with which a fiction in the mind or on the word-processor can be altered means that the effect is nearly as ‘evanescent’(169) as the fictions provided by the media.
Already in Out the narrator was obsessed with the mind's capacity for erasing one version of a story and substituting another: ‘We can make our errors in a thought and reject them in another thought, leaving no trace of error in us’(51/53).
Likewise, Mira in Amalgamemnon describes the stories she tells herself as writing ‘on sand’(140).
The oral media have accustomed people to continual and infinitely practicable mutability.
With a text on a word-processor no one version is final, any version can be altered without a trace.
as if to demonstrate the facility with which word-processed text can be subject to systematic manipulation, Perry repeats an entire paragraph of his text in which he lists the commands that effect this repetition (167).
It is in the nature of long-hand and typescript that corrections and annotations are visible, as in Out , whereas in Verbivore there is very little of Brooke-Rose's characteristic variation on the same phrases.
This technique is grounded in a form of composition that is outmoded: the age of the word-processor has made possible in practice a perpetual variation and continual performance which can only be indicated obliquely in print.
In the society portrayed in the novel the printed codex is obsolete; books are distributed on diskette which can be altered at will, heralding the end of the definitive text.
Marshall McLuhan and Walter Ong see the print revolution as an enabling condition for the establishment of fixed point of view which led to the rise of the novel (McLuhan 1962:126–7,135–6; Ong 1982:133,148–9).
Maurice Couturier disputes the necessary relation between print and perspectival unity in narrative, arguing instead that ‘print has allowed the novelist to multiply the points of view without making his book unreadable’(1991:142).
But here he confuses the issue, for while print may well have initially encouraged authors to focus on an individual's perception and cognition of the world, this does not mean that this technique is necessarily bound to be dominant in printed texts, for as the novel evolved, so did the concept of point of view.
Moreover, the examples Couturier gives are of multiple discrete points of view carefully distinguished within the novels in question (The Sound and the Fury ,Pale Fire ), whereas the mutable point of view employed in Verbivore is a technique developed out of the possibilities inherent in print, but moving toward the mutability of cybernetic text.
Couturier is more convincing in his demonstration of how the increase in available textual material brought about by the invention of print led to new strategies for incorporating one text into another without overt plagiarism (48).
The even greater increase in the availability of textuality made possible by the digital revolution, combined with the facilities it allows for altering, merging, and adding to already written texts, presents a related but different set of problems to the novelist.
In his analysis of the relationship between literary study and advances in cybernetic technology, Richard Lanham argues that the computerization of knowledge — including fiction — will change our conception of the nature of textuality.
Not only will we be obliged to recognize the ‘perpetual immanent metamorphosis’(1989:273) characteristic of contemporary multi-media texts, but our understanding of the ‘great works’ of the past will be modified as well.
Lanham predicts the emergence of a new ‘rhetoric of the arts’ which will focus not on a set of ‘Great Ideas’but on ‘how knowledge is held’(286), both on the medium and on the message, and of course, on their interaction.
What Lanham describes as ‘perpetual immanent metamorphosis’ comes in Verbivore to infect the coherence of both point of view and plot structure.
That the mutability of a text should be based on a cybernetic paradigm as opposed to a print paradigm in no way threatens to affect the characteristics specific to its status as a written text.
Rather, certain elements of the written narrative — its ability to mix different modes of discourse and to create logically impossible situations — will be foregrounded to the detriment of elements such as unity of point of view which came to narrative with the invention of print.
In Verbivore as a whole, as in its fantastic sub-plot, the oral and the written dimensions of language are opposed but also intimately related.
Jip and Zab succeed in contacting Xorandor's offspring orally, and of course it is orally that they themselves finally work out their differences.
Furthermore, the written narratives which constitute the novel are shot through with the vestiges of oral culture: incomplete sentences, a tendency toward verbosity and digression, as well as an abundance of transcriptions of actual dialogue.
It is clear that Brooke-Rose does not propose a return to the hegemony of the printed word, and that her tale of the sabotage of communication technology is not merely the vengeful fantasy of a frustrated novelist.
We have, as the novel suggests, been immersed for too long in a predominantly oral culture for it not to have permanently altered our minds.
If there is to be a ‘secondary literacy’ of the kind imagined and enacted in Verbivore , it will necessarily have a reciprocal relationship with contemporary technological inventions and institutions.
It will be one which relies on its oral counterpart for its survival (through television and radio adaptations, interviews with authors, etc.).
But the dependence is mutual: Decibel needs an imaginative creator to invent her, and without the creative impetus represented by written genres, it is hinted that the powers of the imagination will slowly die.
4.4 Textermination: Creative Reading and the Ontology of Fiction.
Just as there is a break in the four volumes which constitute the Omnibus ,Thru being in many respects a new departure, so the final volume of the Quartet breaks with the technological preoccupations of the first three novels.
Textermination is not directly concerned with technology; rather it elaborates the issues raised by the current place of the novel in our technological society.
Many of the questions of communication and individual creativity which are explored through media and cybernetic models in the earlier novels are treated in Textermination with relation to the communication between a fictional text and its readers.
Similarly, science fiction motifs give way in this novel to fantasy elements which maintain it at one remove from realism but prevent it from falling into a generic category.
Like its three predecessors,Textermination is a cautionary novel, for it deals with the gradual (ex) termination of novelistic worlds.
But it is neither an elegy of the novel nor a grim prediction of its imminent demise.
Instead it plays with the ‘death of reading’, for novels have always relied on the reader to bring them to life.
Whereas Amalgamemnon focuses on the fictionality of many of the so-called discourses of ‘truth’,Textermination treats the concept of fictionality from the point of view of reception.
This treatment takes two forms.
The novel sets the individual reader's response above authorial determination of meaning, orthodox critical interpretations, and other ‘closed’ forms of response.
It also emphasizes the importance of readings in which fictional texts are recognized for what they are rather than being treated as truth claims or pronouncements about the world.
The setting of the novel is the annual ‘Convention of Prayer for Being’ held in San Fransisco.
Attending the convention are characters from hundreds of works of literary fiction from all ages and all parts of the world who convene with the express purpose of bolstering their existences and securing their continued survival.
They accomplish this task by listening to papers delivered on them and by attending ‘pray-ins’ in which they pray to the Implied Reader.
Prominent figures include Jane Austen's Emma, Emma Bovary, Dorothea Brooke from Middlemarch , Felipe Segundo from Carlos Fuentes's Terra Nostra , and Gibreel Farishta from Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses .
There are also characters present from works by authors as diverse as Homer, Clarice Lispector, Mark Twain, Milan Kundera, and Eugène Sue.
The convention is organized by eminent literary critics and support staff include ‘interpreters’ whose job it is to facilitate relations between the characters as well as ensuring the smooth running of the convention generally.
The novel opens with a series of quotations from well-known works of European literature loosely strung together with third-person narrative.
Each quotation describes a journey in a carriage taken by the protagonists of works which are in many cases those whose titles bear their names:Emma ,Madame Bovary ,Clarissa , etc.
Suddenly all the characters find themselves in an ‘aerobrain’ headed across the Atlantic toward San Fransisco, with a stop-over in Atlanta en route .
On leaving this city the characters have a vision of its demolition by fire, or rather, as it burns we are given a series of famous fictional burnings of cities, libraries, and books.
This constitutes a ritualistic burning of the books in which the characters were conceived; they are thus taken out of the ‘old world’ of their origins and made to embark on an adventure in the ‘new world’of Brooke-Rose's novel.
The plot of the remainder of the novel revolves around a series of attempted rebellions by various factions at the convention who are critical of the way it is organized.
Each of these challenges comes to nought in the end though, for, as one of the interpreters explains, ‘Some will say nothing happens in this novel, in this, Convention, and they'd be dead right.
It's not about events, but about characters and their discourse’(160).
When the delegates from Western literature meet on the first day to pray for their existence, there is an attempted disruption of the ceremony by Muslim fundamentalists who claim to object to the Christian format of the proceedings, but, as we later discover, their real target is the elusive Gibreel Farishta whom they are trying to punish for his heretical views.
Order is eventually restored through the good offices of the interpreters Kelly and Jack, but no sooner are the terrorists under control than there is a second attempt to sabotage the convention by characters from television who demand representation.
A quarrel ensues in which the television characters argue that they are more deserving of prayer than novelistic characters because the latter have a far longer life; the characters from novels insist that only they need their existences reinforced because only they are in danger of losing their audience.
Meanwhile Kelly begins to suspect that many of the people helping to run the convention may also be fictional.
The police inspector who investigates the terrorist attack turns out to be none other than Columbo, the clerks at the hotel are discovered to be Akaky Akakievich, Badin, Devushkin, Mr Guppy, Goliadkin, Sainthomme, and Uriah Heep, and the journalists who report it include Jake Barnes, Ian Scuffling, Joe McCarthy Hynes, and Rouletabille.
Her worst fears are confirmed when she finds a list, containing the entry ‘McFadgeon, Kelly.
From Textermination , by Mira Enketei’(98), of all the characters who have completely ceased to exist because they are no longer read.
Mira herself makes several appearances, both in the first and the third persons, before also discovering that her name is on the list as the delegate from Amalgamemnon , whereupon she too ‘dies’.
There follows an attempted conspiracy by ‘I-narrators’ in the aim of increasing their prominence and defining their specific needs, a revolt by several characters against their authors (most notably Oedipa Maas from The Crying of Lot 49 who declaims her views as a feminist despite Pynchon's ‘macho’stance), and finally, a protest by a gay rights group against the under-representation of homosexuality in literature.
The novel ends with San Fransisco going up in flames, then succumbing to a monstrous earthquake.
(This recalls the burning of Atlanta at the beginning: here it is the novel Textermination which is auto-destructing.)
The only survivors are, appropriately, the participants of the convention who wander the streets before eventually making their respective ways home in a repetition of the opening scene.
What Brooke-Rose does with discursive and textual matter in much of her previous fiction she does here with personae .
Thru and Amalgamemnon ‘plagiarize’ texts from other authors, whereas Textermination abducts their characters.
The first scene of the novel involves a paradigmatic ‘crossing’ of characters from different fictional worlds.
When Jane Austen's Emma accidentally enters a carriage containing Goethe's Lotte and Goethe himself (characters from Thomas Mann's Lotte in Weimar ), she finds herself unaccountably thinking and speaking in Lotte's voice, for she has crossed into another fictional world.
Just as in her earlier fiction Brooke-Rose fused discourses, so in Textermination she fuses characters by making them (and their discourses) interact.
In Textermination the reader's mind becomes a veritable anthology of literature which supplants the author's literary heritage as the source on which the novel draws.
The narrator of Flann O'Brien's At Swim-Two-Birds expresses the view that ‘Characters should be interchangeable as between one book and another….
The modern novel should be largely a work of reference’(1939:25, cit.
Brooke-Rose 1981:114).
Textermination is a work of reference of this kind.
The idea that characters could be interchangeable units raises the question of just what a fictional character is and what is involved in shuttling it between novels.
As early as The Sycamore Tree Brooke-Rose displayed frustration with the limitations of the traditional character, but in Textermination she succeeds in manipulating these limitations in such a way as to move beyond them without completely abandoning the trappings of realism.
The ‘reduction’ of characters to functions or ‘ghosts’does not threaten their vitality; as fictions they survive and ‘wander the streets’even when the physical world is severely altered.
Their mode of existence has changed, however: they no longer represent coherent subjects but discourses transmuted through (metaphoric) interaction into ‘poems’, ‘gaps’ in the text at which the reader is invited to intervene, or deictics with multiple and mutable referents.
Like the ‘alien’ Xorandor and the fantastic figure of Decibel, these characters are coextensive with their language, but in Textermination there is displacement of creative responsibility from author to reader.
It is up to the reader to recognize the imported characters and thus to ‘actualize’ the discursive worlds the novel brings together.
In questioning the ontological determinacy of the fictional character, Brooke-Rose is striking at the mainstay of the traditional novel.
If a character is not inscribed in the text, but instead a product of the reading process, the status of the entire world the character represents is highly variable.
The ontological status of fictional worlds has been of interest to philosophers as well as literary critics.
Roman Ingarden's seminal work The Literary Work of Art provided the basis for much subsequent analysis of the nature of fiction and the process of reading.
Ingarden defines the act of reading as the ‘realization’ of the work which is accomplished as the reader progressively fills in the ‘spots of indeterminacy’in it (1931:246–54).
In Verbivore Decibel makes an oblique reference to Ingarden's theory when she describes her own problematic existence:
Perry tried to kill me off — as if one could kill an abstraction, a measurement.
Oh, I know, some of you oddball characters will say: Don't be so vague, if you're a measurement.
But a few might add: you also belong to the stratum of represented objects, you have a right to be indeterminate.
(177)
Wolfgang Iser points out that Ingarden's analysis implies two types of indeterminacy: that which is eventually eliminated in the process of ‘realization’ and that which is integral to the world of the text and a constitutive aspect of its status as fiction (Iser 1978:173).
Brian McHale sees the foregrounding of the second type of indeterminacy as a characteristic strategy of postmodernist fiction.
In his discussion of transgressions of ontological levels in which characters are instrumental, McHale remarks that ‘Characters often serve as agents or ‘carriers’ of metalepsis, disturbers of the ontological hierarchy of levels through their awareness of the recursive structures in which they find themselves' (1987:121).
Yet novels and plays that have characters who are aware or become aware of their fictional status generally focus on the relation of the characters to their author, as in Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author , Flann O'Brien's At Swim-Two-Birds , Muriel Spark's The Comforters , Robert Pinget's Mahu, ou le matériau and countless other postmodernist texts.
Brooke-Rose reverses this familiar postmodernist trope by focusing instead on the relation between the characters and their readers.
McHale points out that ‘a character's knowledge of his own fictionality often functions as a kind of master-trope for determinism — cultural, historical, psychological determinism, but especially the inevitability of death’(123).
When used to foreground the character-reader relationship the same device does just the opposite.
A reader is free to interpret the actions and the motivations of the characters of even the most traditional novel in a variety of ways.
Knowledge of their ontological status thus functions in Textermination as a trope for indeterminacy.
Iser expands on Ingarden's description of the reading process as the filling in of gaps but criticizes Ingarden's belief that there are true and false realizations of a text (1978:178).
Susan Suleiman points out, however, that Iser's claim for the multiplicity of ‘correct’ readings is in fact not borne out by his readings themselves (Suleiman 1980:24, cit.
Brooke-Rose 1981:35).
In Textermination the variety of reading experiences is ensured by the fact that for each reader the ‘gaps of indeterminacy’ will be different.
How he or she reads depends not only on what Eco calls ‘passeggiati inferenziali’(1979:204), but also on his or her specific cultural heritage, a dimension of the reading process which Iser acknowledges but fails to take fully into account.
Like Between , in which foreign languages serve as a psychological trigger to recall the experience of incomprehension that is an integral part of travel,Textermination makes use of novelistic allusions which readers will be aware that they do not always understand.
The interpreter Kelly functions as a surrogate for the reader who is ashamed of his or her literary ignorance: ‘Gaps, so many gaps in her reading, she'll never catch up’(42).
In this novel the reader is the one irreducible gap or ‘spot of indeterminacy’ which roves the text at will and fills holes in his or her knowledge on whim.
Because the novel relies on prior literary knowledge, each individual reading will necessarily be the idiosyncratic result of an interaction between the proper names given and the reader's capacity to ‘round out’ these names by furnishing them with personalities and circumstantial details (which may vary considerably even between readers who have read the same texts).
The use of extraneous knowledge is a feature of all of Brooke-Rose's novels, but in this case the knowledge deployed requires that of the reader to activate it.
Textermination thus privileges active participation in the creative process on the part of the reader over authoritative readings by professional interpreters.
At one point in the novel the ‘implied author’ intervenes to argue that in critical discourse the critic-as-reader becomes a principle of unity and semantic determination:
…when came the fashion for the vanishing author, the silent author, the transparent text…, the critics, always quick to adapt their vocabulary to the latest bandwagon, started calling the narrator both character who narrates and the producer of the text, that is, the author….
The author was out.
All authority rested in the text.
And later still all authority rested in the Reader, Implied, Ideal or whatever.
And so they passed imperceptibly from phrases such as‘the author's intention is clearly’ to ‘the text clearly says’, and then to ‘the reader clearly infers’.
But behind this lip-service to fads, what the author intends, what the text says, what the reader infers, is in any case what the critic interprets.
He too is Reader, he too is God.
(117)
This type of interpretation is impossible in the case of Textermination , for no critic can foresee each and every one of the possible epistemological permutations put into play by the interaction between the text and its potential readers.
Though deceptively easy to read, the novel resists authoritative ‘readings’.
All texts must be read in order for them to ‘exist’; the corollary of this is that the mode of their existence in the world depends on how they are read.
In Amalgamemnon ,Xorandor , and Verbivore the fictional or mythic nature of the simulations and abstractions we take to be fact is demonstrated by simulations of these simulations which reveal them to be discursive constructs.
Similarly,Textermination exposes the fictional nature of readings of texts.
Like the critical readings which present themselves as accurate representations of what an author ‘really’ intended, what a work ‘really’means, or how a reader ‘really’experiences it, but are no more than interpretations or simulations of these supposedly verifiable facts, readings of ‘non-fictional’texts are also in part fictitious constructs.
In a recent article (1990a) Brooke-Rose addresses the issue of determinate versus indeterminate readings of texts and the consequences this has for people's world-views.
She brings together under the heading ‘palimpsest history’ both Terra Nostra and The Satanic Verses , for both novels provide creative or poetic readings of discursive traditions — the history of the Spanish empire and the history of Muslim heritage.
That these ‘alternative histories’ should be deemed in some sense heretical is a consequence of a perceived transgression of the firmly grounded distinction between secular and sacred exegesis on the one hand, and novels on the other.
The fundamentalist outrage directed against Salman Rushdie (parodied in Textermination ) is a real-life consequence of a failure to read the novel as a novel, that is, as a plotted confrontation between people with different points of view, not as a tract or a credo.
This ‘mistake’ is itself the result of a failure to recognize the ontological status of the novel, i.e. the irreducible indeterminacy which leaves it open to multiple interpretations.
Brooke-Rose describes The Satanic Verses as ‘a different, a poetic, re-creative reading, of what is in the Qur'an’(1990a:25).
Readings such as this must be situated between sacred or received texts and those of their official interpreters:
…the novel's task, unlike that of history, is to stretch our intellectual, spiritual and imaginative horizons to breaking point.
Because palimpsest histories do precisely that, mingling realism with the supernatural and history with spiritual and philosophical reinterpretation, they could be said to float half-way between the sacred books of our various heritages, which survive on the strength of the faiths they have created,…and the endless exegesis and commentaries these sacred books create.
(1991a:189)
The view that certain types of fiction occupy a mediatory position between the ‘reality’ of a cultural heritage and contemporary ‘true’accounts of it elevates these texts to a status which the novel has not held for quite some time.
The novel's role could then be said to be to question the way we think about culture.
This role is assumed in Textermination vis-á-vis the genealogy of the novel itself; Brooke-Rose's novel can thus also be included in the generic category of ‘palimpsest history’.
By using characters from other such works, she draws an implicit parallel between religious or historical fundamentalism which enforces a single interpretation of the discourses of the past, and literary critical ‘fundamentalism’ which arrogates an individual reading of a text to the status of a general truth.
The obviousness of the creative mis-reading of world literature offered by the novel highlights the idiosyncrasy of reception and demonstrates that ‘perpetual immanent metamorphosis’ is inherent in reading as well as writing.
The relation between contemporary modes of communication and the contemporary novel may not always be obvious or straightforward, but it has profoundly changed the ways in which people think about fiction and the value they attach to reading.
At one extreme is Calvino who views technology as the occasion for a radical reconception of the act of reading.
He foresees the disappearance of the author in favour of a cybernetic combinatory which will shift the decisive moment of a text from its production to its reception.
The reader will, he predicts, find in a machine-produced text the quintessentially human ‘ghosts’ that haunt the collective unconscious (1967).
Christine Brooke-Rose does not go so far as to disavow authorial creativity altogether, but she too sees technology as the possible key to a breakthrough in how we think about the human subject.
In ‘The Dissolution of Character in the Novel’ she expresses her faith in the power of the computer as a concept to change literature in the same way that print did nearly five hundred years ago:
…perhaps the computer…will alter our minds and powers of analysis once again, and enable us to create new dimensions in the deep-down logic of characters.
I do not mean computers with human emotions or humanoids with computer brains.
…I mean a completely different development arising from computer logic but as unimaginable to us now as a Shakespearean character would have been to an oral-epic culture, and a different way of thinking about and rendering…all worldly phenomena, as revolutionary as the scientific spirit that slowly emerged out of the Renaissance and the Gutenberg galaxy.
(1986a:195)
The ‘Intercom Quartet’ represents an attempt to move in this direction by exploring the cognitive and cultural consequences of contemporary developments in technology.
Modern technology and the discourses of knowledge associated with it represent both a threat to society and a possible means of expanding human consciousness.
The role of the novel at this juncture is seen by Brooke-Rose to be crucial.
Its status as written narrative fiction and its function as a means of communication provide it with the wherewithal to participate actively in present-day debates about the future of social institutions.
Whether it will rise to this task is, the Quartet suggests, a question of its ability to recognize its potential and adapt itself accordingly.

Chapter Nineteen
Floy and Fenella and Snodgrass had passed an almost totally sleepless night.
Floy had spent several hours in deep discussion with Snodgrass and, between them, they had made an attempt to sketch out the layout of Tara, so that they could see if there were any weak areas they might make use of.
‘But I think it is a pointless exercise,’ said Floy, somewhere towards morning, a thin, cold light filtering in through the windows to where he sat at a great desk, his black hair tumbled, hollows in his cheeks, his face white with fatigue.
‘For one thing we've hardly seen Tara and, for another, we don't know what kind of spells and enchantments they might have strewn about.’
Snodgrass, who had studied more sketches and impressions of the lost castles and palaces of Earth than he could remember, said he thought that nothing like Tara had ever existed anywhere in any world.
‘Didn't someone in the Wolfwood say it was partly raised by sorcerers?’ he said.
‘That'll be it, mark my words.
You're almost sure to be right about the spells and enchantments.
Difficult.
It'll be the kind of place you might walk out of as brisk and easy as a knife cutting butter, or you might very well wander about for days, well, weeks even, without finding a proper door.
It's always the same with enchanted castles,’ said Snodgrass, as if , thought Fenella, only vaguely listening, enchantments were the sort of thing you met up with every day.
Fenella had not heard all of the discussion.
She had curled up in the deep old window seat, the velvet coverlet from the bed wrapped about her for warmth, and had drifted in and out of an uneasy sleep.
Of course they would escape and of course they would outwit the Gruagach, thought Fenella, her mind tumbling with images, fighting to stay awake in case she could help Floy and Snodgrass.
Of course they would escape and they would rescue Nuadu.
It was important not to remember how Nuadu had looked in those last moments, defiant and unafraid, his head thrown back as the Robemaker had dragged him forward by the vicious crimson rope-lights.
I won't remember it, thought Fenella, leaning her flushed cheek against the cold window.
I'll remember how he looked at me just before the Robemaker took him and how he called me ‘Lady’.
And I'll remember, as well, those strange fragments of memory I had when we arrived, because they certainly weren't anything from my memory.
But it was probably better not to think about Nuadu at all.
Fenella pulled the velvet folds of the cover about her and tried to sleep and not to think about what would happen and whether they would be let  out of these rooms and what stories she might have to tell the Gruagach about Star People and the Fire Court and the other fictional places they were supposed to have travelled to.
Her mind swam in and out of sleep and the fire burned lower.
And then, quite suddenly, it was full morning and the sun was slanting across the floor of the rooms.
Floy was sleeping where he sat, his head resting on his folded arms, a look of such exhaustion on his face, that Fenella almost wished to be back on Renascia fighting Quilp and the Council and trying to plan to outwit the Dark Lodestar.
But it is morning, thought Fenella, washing her hands and face in the water from the brass ewers, liking the thick, fluffy towels left for them.
It is morning and it is sunny and there is a world to be explored.
And surely, oh surely, we shall be able to go after Nuadu, and surely the giants are friendly and last night was only a bad dream.
And, said Fenella, very firmly indeed, I will not believe that any of us are in danger.
They were taken to breakfast by Caspar, who unlocked the doors, and regarded them rather shamefacedly.
‘Good morning,’ said Floy, as if nothing had happened and Caspar, who looked uneasily over his shoulder, then said, in an urgent whisper, ‘I didn't like locking you in, you know, but I didn't have any choice.’
‘I don't think we expected anything else,’ said Floy, with complete courtesy and Caspar hunched his shoulders crossly and said, ‘There might be a plan.
Could you be ready and keep your wits about you, do you think?’
‘Of course.’
Floy did not say: even though we do not really trust you, but Fenella and Snodgrass both felt him think it.
Fenella thought that it was a pity that Caspar was so scared of the giants, because he knew so much about Tara that he might have been of considerable help.
He certainly knew the whereabouts of the Robemaker's workshops.
But he had locked them in last night and he had done so on orders from the Gruagach so they did not dare rely on him.
They would do much better to rely just on their three selves.
‘I'm quite hungry for some breakfast,’ said Snodgrass, as they followed Caspar along the galleries and down the staircases and through huge, high-ceilinged chambers.
‘It's always very plentiful,’ said Caspar seriously.
‘And His Majesty has particularly requested your presence.’
‘How very good of him,’ said Floy, blandly.
Caspar shot him a suspicious look.
‘I suppose you don't trust me after I locked you in,’ he said.
‘Quite right.
We don't.’
‘I suppose I can't blame you,’ said Caspar, morosely.
‘I wouldn't trust me, either.
But you'll see.
I shall come up with something.
I'm supposed to be guarding you, but I shan't.
Only we'll have to make it look as if I am.
In here.
If you could try to look as if you're being guarded, it would go a long way.
But don't worry too much about it, because they won't notice very much.
They're not morning people, the Gruagach.’
Breakfast was served in a long, low-ceilinged room, with a deep  fireplace, on which were roasting several animals which Snodgrass said, in an awed whisper to Fenella, were oxen.
There were barrelsful of butter and platters of fruit and great sides of bacon and ham and sizzling sausages.
The giants washed their breakfasts down with immense tankards of mead and ale and grunted and were inclined to be morose, which seemed to bear out Caspar's remarks about them not being morning people.
The Gnomes of Gallan sat together at the far end of the table.
They were presented to Floy and Fenella and Snodgrass by Caspar and they had all swept bows (Bith's hat had fallen off) and been charmed to meet travellers like this.
But then, wasn't Tara the place for travellers, they said.
Hadn't it always been known as the centre of the Western World?
They were rather pleased with themselves for saying this, because it was something the Gruagach would find quite flattering and, also, it had not referred to the Wolfkings, which would have been extremely discourteous, not to say disastrous.
They sat together, in the small-sized chairs brought up by Balor, and ate their breakfasts and told one another wasn't this the finest meal ever and would they all look at the roasting oxen, because it was a long time, well it was years, really, since any of them had seen such a sight.
Bith took off his hat, which was a polite thing to be doing, and Culdub Oakapple tucked his yellow neckerchief into his collar by way of table napkin.
Fenella, who rather liked the look of the Gnomes, thought they were a bit like careful children, diligently remembering their manners, sprinkling their conversation with ‘please’ and ‘thank you’, and with things like, ‘I'll trouble you for the jam pot, your honour’, or ‘after you with the tomato chutney, your worship’.
They polished off most of the sausages, which they seemed greatly to enjoy, and Bith of the Bog-Hat and Flaherty shared a firkin of the giants' ale, which Balor had brought up from the cellars.
But after they had finished eating (which seemed to the travellers to take for ever), Goibniu sent the other giants out of the room, because he had important business to discuss.
‘You'll be told in good time,’ he said and would not listen when Goll the Gorm said, crossly, as they trooped out, that it was always the same; they were not told what was going on and it was a disgrace and a scandal and there'd be a revolution at Tara before much longer, if there wouldn't be an outright war.
‘Now,’ said Goibniu, resting his elbows on the table rather vulgarly and eyeing Fenella greedily, ‘now, my guests, we have a little proposition to put to you.’
Floy, who had been cutting himself a slice of ham, looked up, because there was a lick of anticipatory pleasure in Goibniu's tone.
He exchanged a look with Fenella and saw that she was watching Goibniu quite politely, but that there was a wariness in her eyes.
But Goibniu was smooth and courteous; he was very nearly urbane.
He paid a brief homage to the Gnomes, who had journeyed all the way from the Gallan Mountains to bring their ideas for the new Queen's Crown Jewels and did not refer to the fact that they were four days late on account of getting lost on the way.
He said they would all be wanting  to study the designs the minute Balor had cleared away breakfast and Bith at once reached for the knapsacks, and said he hoped Flaherty had not spilled jam on the drawing of the four-pronged diadem and Flaherty, injured, said indeed he had not and it the best damson jam he had ever tasted.
‘And if there's a bite more, I won't refuse, your prominence.’
Goibniu remembered that Gnomes were reportedly extremely greedy, but said they would take a look at the designs now, if the Gnomes were quite ready, thus galvanising the Gnomes into anxious industry, resulting in much unpacking of knapsacks and unrolling of parchments and remarks such as, ‘Who's got the plan of the turquoise bracelet?’ and ‘Why did we bring along four sketches for the everyday silver tiara?’and ‘Flaherty's sitting on the Coronation sceptre!’
But, at length, the drawings and sketches were laid out and the plans for Flaherty's new steam-powered melting pot which had unaccountably been packed by mistake put away again.
Weights were placed at all the corners of the sketches to stop them springing back into tight rolls.
‘And there it is, your throneships,’ said Bith, beaming, because when all was said and done, hadn't they produced the finest old sketches ever heard of and wasn't there good reason for them to feel proud?
Goibniu was pleased with the designs.
The Gnomes had gone to considerable trouble; Culdub and Bith had sat up long hours and consulted books and chronicles and there had been much burning of late candles and worried scurryings to and fro between the Gnomes' houses in the little mountain village.
Flaherty and MacKnobb had produced thin gold and silver and emerald paint with which they had coloured the fine charcoal designs and the end result was really rather good.
The Gnomes sat together at the end of the breakfast table and waited anxiously for the verdict.
They thought that Goibniu was looking happy (although it was always difficult to tell with giants) and thought, wasn't it a fine old thing to see how well the designs were being received and wasn't it great, altogether, to see how well received the Oakapple's sketches were, because hadn't he been the guiding light behind most of the work?
Goibniu studied the parchments for some time, seeing that there was an elaborate circlet of gold for Flame if she became Inchbad's Queen, studded with firestones which would be mined from Fael-Inis's Fire Mountains.
There was a corresponding Crown for Inchbad, of course, and the Gnomes had cleverly managed to make these subtly similar.
There were ornate neck circles with chippings of moonstones and slender, silver anklets engraved with the tree symbols of fertility and great chunks of raw gold somehow veined with amber which would be used as Coronation accessories.
And there were silver amulets studded with turquoise, bearing the insignia of the Gruagach and also the insignia of Flame's ancestry.
This had been quite difficult and the Gnomes had scratched their heads a good deal, because, although people did not openly refer to it, everyone knew that Flame's father was Fael-Inis and it had meant a lot of worrisome discussions as to whether this fact ought to be openly acknowledged, or whether it might be discourteous to draw attention to it.
Goibniu thought it all looked very nice.
He did not refer to anything so vulgar as payment, of course, because the Gnomes would not expect it.
But he said they would present the designs to Reflection, these very sketches, and there would be a great deal of acclaim given to the Gnomes as a result.
Culdub Oakapple opened his mouth to say that acclaim was all very well in its way, but they had been hoping for something a bit more financial than that, but the two Gnomes on each side of him trod on his foot to stop him, because you could not always trust the Oakapple to be tactful.
They could not be offending the Gruagach, and they especially could not be offending Goibniu the Greediguzzler.
Bith remembered a nearly forgotten, seldom-told belief that, although Gnome was an acquired taste amongst giants, they would occasionally serve it at very special occasions.
If Inchbad married Flame, it would be a very special occasion indeed; it might be just the occasion when they would want a dish or two of roast Gnome and, more to the point, it would get the Gruagach out of paying for the new Crown Jewels.
Fenella and Floy and Snodgrass had sat quietly at the other side of the table, not eating very much, listening carefully to everything that was said.
Floy had been interested in the Gnomes' sketches; like Fenella, he found the Gnomes rather attractive, friendly people and he thought their designs were clever and subtle and beautifully drawn.
Snodgrass embarked on a story about a very famous jewel called the Koh-i-noor, which he thought had once adorned a great King's State Crown and explained how it had been so rare and so heavy that it had had to be kept locked away behind bars and guards, so that nobody could steal it.
The Gnomes were very interested in this; as Flaherty said, you could not know too much about these things, although it was a pig's pity that such a jewel couldn't be worn by the King of the day when he went about his reigning, because wasn't that the purpose of crowns and jewels anyway?
‘But,’ said Flaherty, ‘it's all for your exaltednesses to say.’
‘We thought,’ put in Bith, who was feeling a bit bolder now that Goibniu had approved their ideas, ‘we thought that the lady — that is Reflection's daughter — might like to see the designs before we put them to the forge, your honour.’
He looked wise and solemn when he said this, because he knew that ladies — even sorceress's daughters — had their own ideas about what they ought to wear and it was not to be supposed that Flame would be any different.
‘Colours,’ said Bith rather vaguely.
‘It'd be nice for her to be given the chance to make a suggestion or two.’
Flaherty asked who was to take the sketches to the Fire Court and the Gnomes at once looked alarmed, because hadn't they already travelled all the way from Gallan and it a terrible long journey, never mind getting lost twice, as well as the Robemaker's Workshops and the Cruachan Cavern being on the route.
‘But of course,’ said Bith firmly, ‘if your honourships were wanting it, then we'd go and be pleased to.’
And the Gnomes looked at Goibniu worriedly and waited.
Goibniu was still studying the drawings and thinking that Reflection, greedy creature, would surely not be able to resist them and that it mightn't be a bad idea to revive the ancient traditional dish of roast Gnome for the wedding feast, which would save them having to pay the Gnomes anything.
But he smiled rather overpoweringly at the Gnomes, and said that: no, they would not dream of asking them to make such a journey, so hard on the heels of their march in from Gallan.
‘We are hoping that our two new friends will assist us by acting as emissaries to the Court,’ said Goibniu and, turning his head, smiled at Floy.
‘It wasn't,’ said Floy, in the privacy of their bed-chamber, ‘a request.’
‘An order,’ said Fenella, nodding.
‘Carry out this task, while we keep your lady hostage,’ said Snodgrass.
‘They've locked us in again, you know.’
‘I do know,’ said Floy, his eyes glinting angrily.
‘It was politely done —’
‘That one they call Goll the Gorm,’ nodded Snodgrass.
‘I don't call him polite; in a pig's ear I don't.’
He frowned and said, ‘You know, dear boy, I think we may have to do what they want.’
‘Go to this place — what do they call it? the Fire Court — and take the proposals for the marriage of Inchbad,’ said Floy.
‘Yes.
But that,’ said Snodgrass, worried, ‘would mean leaving Fenella here.’
‘We can't do that,’ said Floy, staring at his sister.
She was listening intently and her eyes were thoughtful, as if she might be toying with some idea of her own.
It was unthinkable that they should leave Fenella here at the mercy of the giants.
‘We'll have to find a way of taking Fenella with us,’ he said.
Fenella, leaning forward eagerly, said, ‘But listen, the journey to the Fire Court takes you past the Robemaker's Workshops.
We heard them all say so.
It's the very thing we've been waiting to hear.’
‘Yes,’ said Floy.
‘But it's too high a price.’
‘It sounds rather fearsome,’ said Fenella, slowly, ‘to be left here with the giants.
But I truly think we can't miss the chance of getting there.’
‘Not if it means us going off without you,’ said Snodgrass.
‘We can't possibly do that.’
‘I don't think we're going to be given any choice in the matter,’ said Floy, rather grimly.
‘Goibniu said they'd send the gatekeeper — what's his name?
Balor — along with us.’
He looked at them.
‘That wasn't simply to show us the way,’ he said.
‘They could give us maps and we could find the way perfectly easily.
It was to make sure we didn't run away.
Balor's coming as a guard.’
‘To bring us back,’ nodded Snodgrass.
‘But of course we d come back for Fenella,’ said Floy.
‘Don't they think we would?’
‘They can't know.
It's this question of different beliefs and different loyalties,’ said Snodgrass.
‘If it wasn't all so dangerous, I'd almost be finding it interesting, you know.’
‘Goibniu suggested that I could mark the evenings by telling them tales of our travels,’ Fenella said, remembering.
‘One tale each night.
I don't know how long I can keep that up,’ said Fenella.
‘But I think I could keep it going for quite a while.
I could tell them about Renascia to begin with.’
She glanced at the other two.
‘Doesn't it seem an awfully long way away, now?’
‘Worlds and aeons,’ said Floy, softly.
‘Shall we miss it when we have time?’ said Fenella, a bit wistfully.
‘I do think I'd like to miss it.
It seems so — so callous not to be thinking about it and wondering what happened to it.’
‘We'll mourn for it when we have time,’ said Floy, touching her hand, and Fenella looked at him gratefully, because that was exactly what she had been feeling.
Of course they would mourn for Renascia and remember all of the good things about it, only just now they had other things to concentrate on.
‘I'll spin the Gruagach some tales,’ she said now, frowning.
‘Renascia and as much as I can remember of Earth legends and perhaps something about the Dark Lodestar as well.’
‘Scheherezade,’ nodded Snodgrass.
‘The lady — well, she wasn't a lady at all, really, but she saved her life by telling exotic tales to her captors.
She spun it out for years.’
‘There you are, then,’ said Fenella.
‘It's been done before and it can be done again.’
‘But look here,’ said Floy, ‘you won't have to do it, because we'll find a way of taking you with us.’
‘as if we'd leave you here on your own,’ said Snodgrass, clicking his tongue at the very idea.
‘I think you'll have to,’ said Fenella, who found the idea completely appalling, but who was trying to be practical and sensible and make it sound safe for them to go so that they could get Nuadu.
‘Also —’ She stopped and looked up, and Snodgrass said, ‘Someone's coming.’
‘The Gruagach?’
‘I don't think so.’
It was not the Gruagach, but Caspar, who had come quietly along to their rooms when the giants were taking their midday snooze.
‘They always do,’ he explained, unlocking the door and coming in cautiously.
‘It's the one time when Tara becomes almost quiet.
Could I sit down?
I've thought of a plan.’
The three travellers looked at one another and then Floy said, ‘Sit down.’
‘It isn't brilliant,’ said Caspar, ‘I'd have to say it isn't brilliant or clever or even very subtle.
But it might work.’
He looked at them, his head on one side, and Floy said, ‘Do go on.’
Caspar said impatiently, ‘Oh, for goodness ’ sake, Floy!
Do I look like the sort of person who consorts with giants!’
He leaned forward.
‘I don't know where you're from,’ he said, ‘and I don't want to know.
I've got enough to worry about without wondering if you're from the Ancient Past or the Distant Future, or somewhere quite different altogether.
It's your business,’ said Caspar firmly.
‘But I do know that the Gruagach have only one use for Humans and if you stay here long  enough you'll find out what that is.
Into the dungeons and then onto the Fidchell board,’ said Caspar, tucking his chins into his neck and looking solemn.
‘And it's a nasty end, that one.’
‘Quite,’ said Floy.
‘Well, I've had enough of it,’ said Caspar, looking plumply mutinous.
‘I've had enough of hunting down Humans for them to play their grisly games with!
It's — it's little short of traitorous,’ he said.
‘And I'm not going to do it any more.
I'm going to do what you said; walk out of tara and hide.’
‘Well?’ said Floy, sending a warning glance to the other two.
‘You'll have to go to the Fire Court with Balor,’ said Caspar, earnestly.
‘You do know that, don't you?
If you don't they'll certainly have you all for supper.’
‘What about Fenella?’
‘Fenella can follow you in a day's time.’
‘How?’
‘I'll bring her,’ said Caspar, and sat back and regarded them with the plump pleasure of a person who has reached a final decision.
It took longer than he had expected to persuade Floy to agree.
Floy was suspicious and Caspar did not really blame him for that.
‘I don't blame you one little bit,’ he said, earnestly trying to win them over.
‘But you can't stay here, that's for sure.’
Floy said, slowly, ‘If Snodgrass and I were to agree to it —’ He stopped and Caspar said, ‘Yes?’
‘How long would the journey take?
And what sort of things might we have to encounter on the road?’
As to that, Caspar had no definite information.
He thought it would certainly be a couple of days' journey to the Fire Court — the giants would be sure to know, he said, because they had already sent emissaries with the marriage proposal.
But he thought it could not be more than a couple of days.
‘Fenella and I would set out a day later,’ he said, looking at Fenella and thinking that she was rather a nice sort of companion to be having on a journey.
Probably she would have a good few stories to tell about the world they had come from.
Caspar would quite enjoy hearing about that.
Floy said, very carefully, ‘Could you show us the route?’ and Fenella looked up, as if , thought Caspar, she had heard something in Floy's voice that the rest of them had not heard.
But he thought it a reasonable request to ask for a route and he took himself away to Tara's great map room to procure maps for them.
He did this quite openly, because if anybody asked where he was going, he would say he was finding out the route to the Fire Court for Floy and Snodgrass's journey.
It was nice to be able to tell the complete truth for once.
But the only person he met was Balor, on his daily forage to the wine store during the Gruagach's afternoon snooze, to replenish his secret stock of ale and mead, which had been sadly depleted with all these unexpected visitors to Tara.
Balor did not grudge offering guests a mite of good wine, because it was only polite, but there was no denying it  made inroads on your hoard.
And if he had to set out on this nonsensical journey to the Fire Court with the Humans, it would be as well to just stock up a bit for his return.
They spread the maps on the floor of the larger of the two bed-chambers and Caspar pointed with a podgy finger to the Fire Country where Reflection had set up her Court.
‘It's on the edges of Fael-Inis's country,’ he said, ‘and we all know why.’
‘Why?’
‘Because,’ said Caspar patiently, but wondering where these three had come from, for goodness' sake, ‘because Reflection once had a bit of a — well, more than a bit really…
And they do say that Flame is very like him.’
He eyed the three travellers a bit hesitantly.
Floy said, ‘Do you mean that Reflection and Fael-Inis were once lovers?’ and Caspar, hugely relieved, said, ‘Well, so they say .’
He glanced over his shoulder and Snodgrass, who loved gossip, glanced over his as well, because you never knew who might be listening in an enchanted castle.
‘They do say,’ said Caspar thrillingly, ‘that she pursued him for positively centuries , until he gave in, purely to get her out of his way.
He's elusive, you see,’ explained Caspar earnestly.
‘You never know quite when you've got him.
Well, that's always supposing you can get him in the first place, because the number of people who have actually seen him, you can count on one hand.’
He paused for breath and regarded them expectantly.
But Floy said, in an expressionless tone, ‘Do go on,’ and Caspar looked at Floy doubtfully, because he was not altogether sure of Floy yet and he had the feeling that Floy might very well be thinking and assessing and generally not revealing all his feelings.
And so Caspar, who though the could be as reserved as the next man, merely said, ‘Oh, he's a strange one, Fael-Inis.
A bit of a fly-by-night.’
And returned to charting the journey to the Fire Court.
Fenella, who had never seen a map quite like this one, had curled up on the floor to listen.
The road to the Fire Court looked quite straightforward really; it seemed as if you had to go past a large lake and on down a narrow, windy mountain road with houses dotted on each side.
Floy had asked about dangers and what they might expect to encounter, but Fenella did not think it looked especially dangerous.
‘Well, it isn't dangerous precisely,’ said Caspar.
He hesitated and tapped the map with his finger.
‘Or, at least it isn't so long as we avoid that bit of road.’
‘Why?’
‘Well, they do say,’ said Caspar, and stopped and looked at them again.
‘They do say that it's there that thy Robemaker has his Workshops.
‘And the Robemaker's Workshops,’ said Caspar, shuddering, ‘are the worst place in the world.’
Chapter Twenty
The Purple Hour was descending as the Robemaker thrust Nuadu Airgetlam before him down the final stretch of road that led to the grisly Workshops.
Nuadu, aching in every bone, the lower part of his face constrained within the harsh red mask fashioned from the Robemaker's ropes of light, had not made a sound.
He thought that the Robemaker was waiting for him to do so; perhaps somehow to indicate that he would ask for mercy, but he had done nothing.
He could not speak and he would not make any gesture that would show weakness.
He would, somehow, behave as the true Wolfprinces would have behaved in such a situation.
He would behave as his mother's people would have behaved.
And so he walked quite calmly and very nearly leisuredly before his captor.
And although the Robemaker lashed out at him from time to time with the thin, cruel rope-lights, he managed not to flinch.
He had some idea of what was ahead of him, for he knew the terrible tales about the Robemaker's Workshops.
He knew it was unlikely that he would ever see the true Ireland again because he was being taken to the place that many people believed to be one of the Gateways to the Dark Ireland.
Certainly, now, he would never see inside Tara.
He could think, with a brief twist of the old cynicism, that he had never seen inside Tara anyway and that he could not miss what he had never had.
But he did miss it; he thought he had been born homesick; he certainly thought he had spent most of his life waiting and longing and aching for the Bright Palace where his mother's people had quarrelled and laughed and made love and war, and where the charming ruthless Wolfkings had woven Ireland's history.
But he had never seen Tara; he had been abandoned at birth, he had been flung out by the King, who would have none of his Queen's bastard wolfson at his Court.
Finally, Nuadu had found his way to the strange twilight community of the Wolfwood; the place that gave shelter to the half-breeds: the bastard sons of Royal Houses, the creatures who were not possessed of sufficient Beastblood to be acknowledged at Tara, but yet were not entirely Human.
Creatures welcome in neither world, he had thought, bitterly.
We were all of us outcasts; we were all of us flung out by the Lords of Tara, who were jealous of their lineage and protective of their inheritance.
These half-breed mongrel creatures had acknowledged Nuadu as an aristocrat; a bastard but still a Wolfprince, royal through his mother's noble blood.
They had made him their leader and Nuadu, cynical and bitter against his own kind, had thought that for all he was a base-born  prince, still he had a Court of a kind and subjects of a sort.
When the Gruagach had come storming down from the Northern Wastes and attacked Tara and stolen away the Wolfking's son, Tara's heir, the people of the half-world of the forest had vanished, afraid and timid.
They had wanted no part of the terror and the bloodshed, and they had hidden in the mountains and the caves and the remote Northern Isles.
Perhaps, when the battles were over and Ireland was whole once more, they would return, but perhaps they would simply remain in the hill-farms and the distant mountains, forging their own cultures, making their own legends, weaving their strange secret stories into the fabric of Ireland's history.
But Nuadu had ridden out for the king and for the captured half-brother he had never known.
He had ridden out for his mother's people as well, and finally, he had joined with the people of the Court, ‘For’ l he had thought, ‘it is my people, my half-brother the Gruagach seek to drive out.’
He had thought he had not cared what became of him in the battle and he had thought that, when it was over, he would return to the Wolfwood and that the creatures amongst whom he had lived would return, also.
But the Wolfking had been killed and the prince imprisoned inside the Dark Realm.
The giants had taken Tara for their own and when Tealtaoich and the others had fled to the Forest Court, Nuadu had gone with them, neither quite one of them nor quite not one of them, but feeling a cautious kinship with them and discovering, with cynical amusement, that they were looking to him to lead them back.
‘After all,’ Tealtaoich had said silkily, ‘you may be a bastard, my friend, but you are a High Queen's bastard and you were sired by a Wolf.
You have the blood of the Wolves of Tara and there is no question but that it makes you a Wolfprince.’
The green eyes had been steady.
‘You have a claim on Tara,’ said Tealtaoich.
‘You are the heir presumptive.’
‘If we are honest, you have far more right to Tara than any of us,’ put in Oisin.
‘Even though we shall not necessarily admit it,’ said Feradach and Nuadu had seen that they would serve even a bastard scion of the Wolfline before any other creature.
And for all that, I have fallen into the hands of the Robemaker, he thought angrily.
I am as much a captive as my half-brother.
Nuadu knew that the Robemaker would put him to the treadmills; that he would be forced to work at powering the Silver Looms to weave the Robemaker's enchantments.
He would have said that he was as courageous as most, but he knew that no one ever escaped from the workshops.
People lived and died there; they did not grow old there, because no one could live for very long in the Robemaker's hands.
And once their physical usefulness was at an end, the Robemaker tore out the souls of his slaves and carried them to the Soul Eaters in the Cruachan Cavern, which some believed were the Gates of Hell.
Well, at least, he thought, with a glimmer of the old wry humour, at least I shall witness things the legitimate Wolfprinces did not.
They were nearing the workshops now and Nuadu could see, in a  saucer-shaped dip, the dull red glow rising into the night sky.
‘The furnaces,’ said the Robemaker, in his dreadful, diseased voice.
‘My creatures stoke them and work the treadmills, and so the Silver Looms are never allowed to still.’
‘My creatures…’
And now I am one of them, Nuadu thought.
The crimson rope-lights still held him, so that he was forced to go on down the slope until they stood before the terrible dwelling place of the necromancer.
Nuadu stopped and the Robemaker stopped with him, as if he might be saying: well, Wolfprince?
Savour this last moment out in the world.
Look your fill on my domain for, once inside, you will never come out.
‘Not until you are useless and flayed and bent,’ said the Robemaker softly and Nuadu knew that his thoughts had been heard with ease.
‘Not until the skin is hanging from your back and your thighs in strips and your flesh is withered from the heat and your sight is dimmed from the dry fire of the furnaces.’
The Workshops were a huddle of black, rather low structures; made of some kind of harsh, dark stone.
Here and there were archways in the stone and through the archways, low doors.
The windows were narrow and mean-looking, but from each one glowed the dull red fire from the terrible furnaces.
And everywhere, at every corner, within every stone and door and roof was the immense, thrumming power of the Silver Looms.
It poured out into the still night and Nuadu shivered, because he knew it for the evil magic of the Dark Ireland; the ancient, malevolent enchantment of the necromancers.
Within the Wolfwood he had known and experienced the strong pure magic of his people; the music of the sidh and, later, the beautiful wild bewitchment of the stirring Tree Spirits.
He had inherited, as well, a thin vein of sorcery of his own; a little from his mother, but a great deal from his father the wolf.
He would have said that he had as reasonable an acquaintance with sorcery as anyone in Ireland.
But now, here, in the hands of the most purely evil being ever known to Leland, on the very threshold of the Dark Realm of the Necromancers, Nuadu felt, as if it was a solid wall, the evil strength and the merciless dark magic emanating from the Workshops.
Behind the Workshops was flat, barren wasteland, with stunted trees, and twisted roots.
Nuadu glanced at this and saw that there might once have been verdant greenery, perhaps even a small forest.
But the heat and the darkness and the twisted magic had long since drained the heart from the land; the dark sorcery had sucked out the goodness and turned it into a stunted, abandoned place.
Black Wry rose in him against this creature, this monstrous being who was turning Ireland into black barrenness; above the mask his eyes glinted and he wanted to spring on the Robemaker and tear his throat from his body.
But he could not move and, even if he had been able to, he knew that the Robemaker could fell him in a breath-space by sorcery.
As they moved nearer, Nuadu felt the heat belch out.
The dull red glow was all about them now and the baleful light fell across the  Robemaker's cloaked figure so that, although his face remained hidden, Nuadu caught the glitter of his eyes, red and inverted and, despite the belching heat, he felt ice close about his heart.
I shall never escape from this place.
I shall die here and then this creature will tear out my soul and carry it to the Court of the Soul Eaters.
And then I shall be flung for ever into the River of the Dead…
And then they were inside, and the doors had closed to.
The sound of the door to the Robemaker's Workshops closing, was one of the worst sounds Nuadu had ever heard.
For a moment, he did not move and, at his side, the Robemaker waited, the slanting eyes watching from deep within the hood.
And then, ‘Well, Wolfprince?’ he said in his hissing, bubbling whisper, making Nuadu think of lipless jaws and clotting wounds.
He wondered what hideous deformity might lie beneath the silken cloak and the deep dark hood.
‘Well, Wolfprince?’ said the Robemaker.
‘Where are your supporters now?
Where are the creatures who swore to you their allegiance if you would regain the Bright Palace for them?’
He leaned nearer and Nuadu stood his ground.
‘They are cowering in the Wolfwood, Nuadu Airgetlam.
They are trembling and hiding,’ he said, the slimy lick of pleasure overlaying his voice.
‘They are protecting their miserable skins while Ireland falls further into my grasp.’
He paused and then said, in a soft, menacing tone, ‘And Tara, Nuadu of the Silver Arm?
What of tara?
Who now walks its silver halls and dwells in its marble galleries?’
One hand was flung outwards in a clutching gesture.
In the hands of my creatures, Wolfprince, just as you, now, are in my hands.’
He indicated the seething red-lit Workshops.
‘Here is the True Ireland,’ said the Robemaker.
‘Here is my Ireland, Wolfprince.
Here is the powerhouse of necromancy.’
And stood back and folded his arms as Nuadu looked about him.
The Workshops of the Looms were far larger than he had expected.
They seemed to stretch back for a very long way and Nuadu, narrowing his eyes, trying to find his bearings, thought that they must go back and back into the hillside behind the road and deep within the earth.
The ceiling was low and there was a thick, suffocating feel to the air and a stale, old stench.
Despite the heat, Nuadu felt again the chill about his heart.
On each side of the room where they stood were massive iron furnaces; great, glowing stoves that belched out waves of heat so that the air was heavy and fetid.
Huge pipes of what looked like iron protruded from the furnaces and ran along the sides of the workshops, disappearing into the ceiling in places and, in other places, into the walls.
Steam rose here and there, not in puffy, damp, friendly clouds as if a kettle was boiling, but in hissing, angry spurts, as if some unseen being was venting its spleen.
Before the furnaces were some of the Robemaker's captured slaves; Humans, once-strong sons of Ireland's farmers and woodcutters and blacksmiths and builders and woolmen.
The ordinary, honest, good-humoured people who had lived under the protection of the Wolfkings  and rendered them allegiance.
Will it never cease, thought Nuadu, this endless hungry taking of our people by the Black Ireland?
He stood very still, staring about him, his eyes adjusting to the glowing heat.
He thought that here and there in the slaves he could detect traces of an old lineage.
There was the dark-eyed, slant-featured look of the ancient lost Royal Houses of Ireland in several of them, the glossy hair that might easily have been fur in others.
But he knew it to be a frequently found trait, for most of the Noble Lords of Tara had long since dispersed and the enchanted Beastblood, once guarded so jealously, had nearly died out.
if these young men possessed traces of the Beastblood, it was from so far back that it could not be measured, and it was so slight that it could no longer hold the power to call upon the beasts for aid.
Black fury rose in him against the evil creature who was leeching Ireland of her youth, but Nuadu quenched it, lest the Robemaker turn it to his use.
As his eyes adjusted to the scorching dry heat, he saw that the slaves were all lightly clad; in the main, they wore ragged breeches, with the upper halves of their bodies and their feet bare.
The exposed skin was flushed and glowing; here and there it resembled tanned leather and, in some cases, it looked as if it had split and healed, and split again.
The slaves' hands were blistered and flayed and oozing, covered with angry weals that were burns from direct contact with the white heat of the furnace doors.
They moved slowly, shamblingly, and there was a terrible hopelessness about them.
Several of the furnace doors were open, and threw out merciless, scorching fire.
The creatures who were working had shovel-shaped implements with which to throw in an endless supply of wood and Nuadu, scarcely able to believe this, thought: but they are felling the Trees!
They are murdering the Trees!
And blinked and looked again, for the felling of living Trees, the cutting and slicing and mutilating of Trees which had not died and dried and seasoned naturally, was one of the oldest and most strictly forbidden practices in Ireland.
As he stood there, a massive double door at the far end was kicked open and several more of the Robemaker's creatures came shuffling in, dragging a wheeled cart, with a newly cut-down beech Tree lying on it.
The Robemaker liked a hand in their direction and the creatures at the cart took up massive double-edged axes and began to hack the Tree into small sections.
As the first axe cut into the Tree, a great wailing cry of agony rent the thick stifling heat of the workshop and Nuadu knew at once that the Tree had been taken down while it lived and while the naiad still dwelled within it.
From where he stood, Nuadu saw the slender, copper-haired Beech Naiad emerge from the murdered tree, her arms chopped to ribbons, her body maimed in a dozen places, the red-gold blood of the beech spurting from her.
She hovered for a brief time over the trunk of the tree, tears streaming from her eyes, shuddering as the axes continued to cut into the wood, shaking her head from side to side.
Nuadu could see that her fingers were gone now, and that she was trying to pull herself back into the heartwood, which would have been her dwelling  and the place from which she drew sustenance and vitality, but the Robemaker made another of his sudden curt gestures and the slaves fell to their work again, sweat streaming from their half-clad bodies and Nuadu saw the heartwood splinter and fall apart.
The Beech Naiad let out a last cry of desolation, and fell to the floor.
There was the sudden achingly sweet scent of burning logs on an autumn night and then the drift of thick, crisp, beech leaves in the depths of a forest and the Beech Naiad seemed to melt and shiver and dissolve into nothing.
The furnaces were blazing up more strongly now, and the slaves began flinging the freshly chopped beech-wood into the molten depths.
There was the cold ring of iron, as they levered the great doors shut and the rhythmic clanking of machinery as the steam from the furnaces was forced along the great pipes.
Through the doors at the far end, Nuadu caught the whirring sound of the Looms.
The slaves continued their stoking, shuffling to and from the cart, heaving the beech logs into the next furnace.
The Robemaker moved forward, prodding Nuadu onwards and, as they moved down the centre of the Workshop, the blazing furnaces roaring on each side of them, Nuadu felt his skin already shrivelling from the heat.
How must it be to work here day after day, month after month, knowing there was no end to it?
He glanced at the working slaves, and saw that their skin ran with fluid from fresh blisters and their eyes were bloodshot, the eyebrows and lashes singed to nothing; many of them walked awkwardly, as if they had become deformed.
The Robemaker said, emotionlessly, ‘The soles of their feet are skinless from the heat of the floors.
There are trays of salt for them to walk across when that happens, so that the raw flesh can be hardened.’
From within the deep dark hood, Nuadu caught the sudden glint of white bone and heard the guttural laugh.
‘And, of course, I hear your thoughts, Wolfprince,’ said the Robemaker.
‘You have surely not forgotten the ancient necromantic art of the Stroicim Inchinn ?’
Nuadu did not move, but the icy fear closed about him again.
The Stroicim Inchinn , the ancient forbidden art, sorcery of the strongest and most dangerous kind: the power of one mind over another.
It was an enchantment expressly forbidden by the Ancient Academy of Sorcerers, and Nuadu had thought that even the Lords of the Dark Ireland hesitated over it.
In the realms where it was studied, it was recognised as the ability to tear and claw into the mind of another.
It was the terrible and forbidden dark side of the pure and honourable Sanhailt and, although Nuadu had heard of it, he had thought it extinct.
The Robemaker was watching the slaves.
‘It would not be practical for their feet to be ruined,’ he said.
‘And if they flinch at the sight of the salt, there are persuasions I can use.’
The crimson rope-light snaked out and Nuadu saw the nearest slaves cower and put up their hands to shield their faces.
One, who did not appear to be as badly scorched as the others, stood his ground, and eyed the Robemaker rather challengingly.
Nuadu wanted to cry out to him not to be so defiant, for the Robemaker could certainly not by vanquished in such a way.
‘Dear me, a reckless one,’ said the Robemaker, sounding amused.
‘A small lesson for you, Human slave.
And the Wolfprince shall see it.’
The crimson rope-lights whipped forward effortlessly and the boy who had glared angrily at the Robemaker was forced back against the nearest furnace.
Nuadu could see that his eyes were distended with fright now, but he stared back at his captor, unflinchingly.
‘You,’ said the Robemaker, gesturing impatiently to the nearest slaves.
‘Take up the axes.
Do it !’
He folded his arms and power streamed from his eyes, so that the two slaves were caught in the white glare.
Slowly, blindly, they raised the axes to shoulder height.
Nuadu knew the young man was already lost.
The Robemaker had only to exert his will; he had already clawed his way into the minds of the two slaves with the axes; it would be nothing to him now to whip their minds to his will.
And his will was that the slave, the young man who was scarcely more than a boy, should somehow die for his brief moment of rebellion.
The two slaves moved jerkily, as if they were at the ends of strings.
Puppets, thought Nuadu, unable to look away.
He is using them like puppets.
The boy was backed against the wall between two furnaces, and Nuadu saw his face twist with pain.
He guessed that the wall would be excruciatingly hot and that the boy's skin would be blistering and shrivelling.
The Robemaker said softly, ‘Slice by slice — and slowly ,’ and the slaves moved mechanically forward.
Slice by slice…
The slaves swung the axes low, with one accord, and the boy's feet were cut from his legs, so that he fell suddenly on to bleeding stumps of leg.
The colour drained from his face and he would certainly have fallen, had not two crimson rope-lights shot out and pinioned his arms to the wall, so that he was forced to stand, vertically, half hanging by his hands, half supported by his mutilated legs.
Blood and splinters of bone spattered the floor, and Nuadu saw that the thin rivulet of blood nearest to the furnace actually bubbled from the heat of the floor.
And when the soles of their feet are skinless, there are trays of salt for them to walk across to harden the skin…
Again!’ said the Robemaker, his voice liquid and clotted now, and the two slaves swung again, a little higher this time, so that the hard, straight shin bones were sliced across, and the boy's legs were shortened a little more.
‘Fuel for the furnaces,’ said the Robemaker.
‘You!
Into the fire with the dead meat!’
And at once, two more leapt forward and scooped up the bleeding lumps of flesh and bone and flung them into the open furnaces.
There was a roar of heat and, briefly and nauseatingly, the sudden sharp scent of cooking.
Nuadu felt his stomach twist and clenched his teeth against it.
The boy was screaming and begging for mercy now, his lips bitten through.
‘Again!’ cried the Robemaker and now his voice had ridden to a high excited whine and Nuadu, glancing covertly at him, saw that he was roused to a devilish excitement.
The boy was barely conscious now; his face was the colour of tallow  candles and his body sagged, held only in position by the crimson lights.
The two slaves were hacking at his thighs now, and two more came forward, moving jerkily, so that Nuadu knew that the Robemaker was using the Stroicim Inchinn on them also.
‘The thighs!’ cried the Robemaker, ‘the thighs and the hips!
Take them before I hurl you, also, into the furnaces!’
He stood for a moment, a towering dark figure and watched as the blood — sluggish now — seeped from the boy's mangled body.
‘Human weakling!’ said the Robemaker, contemptuously.
And then, in a different, gloating voice, ‘But his soul I shall take.’
He moved and the slaves cowered back, as if , thought Nuadu, they had witnessed the next part before and feared it even more than the mutilating of the boy.
The two who had used the double-sided axes seemed to become more aware and Nuadu thought that the Robemaker had probably withdrawn the piercing spikes and the pinchers of the Stroicim Inchinn from their minds.
They looked about them a bit hazily and then at the bleeding half-thing that had been the young boy and scuttled into a corner.
The Robemaker stood over the remains of the boy and lifted his arms wide, so that the cloak fluttered and his arms resembled great black wings.
He pronounced a string of words in an unfamiliar tongue and, as he did so, the light changed abruptly and became dark and malevolent, tinged with purple.
Black-edged shadows fell across the glowing floor.
There was a beating of wings overhead and a leathery, rustling sound and the slaves cringed and covered their faces.
Nuadu stood his ground, his eyes raking the shadows.
For I believe I am about to witness a thing few people see and live to tell of , he thought.
Into the magenta light of the spell-ridden Workshop there appeared a monstrous creature, composed of great leathery wings and claw feet and a hideous, horny head, with great dark, gaping eye sockets and a bony, sloping jaw.
The face of the creature was pointed, animal-like, goat-like, and there were cruel curving talons protruding from its front paws and curling toes with gristly joints and sharp nails at the back.
There was a dry, rustling sound, as if old dry bones were being rubbed together and the sound of fleshless lips chuckling.
Nuadu stayed where he was, but his mind was tumbling with horror and revulsion.
There was a dreadful, fetid stench on the air and the creature swooped across the workshops, the wingspan of its great jagged wings immense.
Nuadu knew that the Robemaker must have summoned one of the creatures from the Cruachan Cavern to take his victim's soul and, as he watched, the winged creature fell on the remains of the young boy, and settled on his chest, nibbling and clawing its way into his face.
Sickness rose in Nuadu, but he fought it and forced himself to watch.
The boy's eyes had been drawn out by the Soul Eater and it gave a dry, evil chuckle of triumph.
Its talons whipped out and embedded themselves into the boy's skull, using the emptied eye sockets as a means of entry and Nuadu, narrowing his eyes against the dimness, saw that the talons were in fact hollow tubes, thin transparent bones.
The Soul Eater crouched for a few moments and Nuadu saw that a thin silvery fluid was beginning to course along its hollow talons.
It gave a low moan and Nuadu felt the nausea lift his stomach again, because there had been a very nearly sexual quality in the sound.
The Robemaker was standing very still, his hooded face turned in the direction of the Soul Eater and its victim.
The slaves were huddled together in a corner, their faces turned away, as if afraid that the Soul Eater's attention might suddenly turn to one of them.
For from the power of a Soul Eater from the Cruachan Cavern, there is no escape, ever…
The winged creature had finished with the boy now and Nuadu thought it had taken its fill of the strange silvery liquid.
But it remained still for a moment and there was the shimmer of silver about the boy's head.
For the soul does not easily yield to those who will steal it for the purposes of evil…
And then the Soul Eater spread its wings again, and the pointed skull-like head turned to the Robemaker.
‘Another soul against your debt, Robemaker ,’ said the creature in a dry, whispery voice.
‘The scales will have tipped a little farther over.
But we ask far more of you before your bondage is at an end.
Mere must be more souls for us, Robemaker .’
‘There will be more, Master,’ said the Robemaker.
‘You know the pronouncement ,’ said the creature.
‘You must live with your curse until we have eaten our fill .’
And then, turning its head to look round the workshops, it said, ‘We do not ask of you that you give us your slaves, Robemaker, for it is vital that the Looms are kept weaving.
It is vital that you continue to suck from Ireland her head and her being and her puny strengths .’
‘I continue to do so, Master,’ said the Robemaker and, although there was not the smallest trace of subservience in his voice, Nuadu, listening intently, received the impression that the Robemaker was choosing his words with care, as if he was in some and of thrall to this being.
The Soul Eater said, ‘We shall meet again, Robemaker.
In the Cavern of Cruachan, at the Court of my people .’
It spread its wings again, and the heavy dark beating of them filled the air.
‘Mere are many centuries before the debt is paid and the curse we placed on you lifted.
Mere are many more nights when you will attend the Court of the Soul Eaters and render us homage .’
There was a deepening of the shadows and a swirling of something heavy and turgid and foul, and then the creature was gone and the Workshops were once again lit to crimson and the slaves turned back to their tasks.
Chapter Twenty-one
Snizort thought he was getting on rather well.
He had spent most of the day talking to the people of the exiled Court and had made copious notes.
He had rather enjoyed it and it had helped him to keep his mind off what might be happening to Snodgrass and to Floy and Fenella.
He had asked a great many questions of the exiled Court and he hoped, he said earnestly to Oisin, that they would not think him inquisitive.
It was only that none of this was quite what he had been used to.
Oisin said, very courteously, ‘Since our own Chroniclers and our Poets and Story Tellers were unable to follow us into exile, it is we who should be grateful to you for creating an account of what is happening.’
This was extremely polite of Oisin and Snizort had been heartened.
He would make a very careful and very thorough account of it all, he said.
He had already made some notes about the battle, and about the Gruagach besieging Tara —;
‘On the orders of the Robemaker and CuRoi,’ said Eogan sharply.
‘Yes, the Gruagach would never have done such a thing if it hadn't been suggested to them,’ put in Feradach.
‘Or even if they hadn't been well paid,’ added Tealtaoich.
‘I hear that Goibniu, the Gruagach High Chancellor, is quite the most venal giant you could ever meet.’
‘Giants are all venal,’ said Feradach.
They were seated round the long oak table, with the remains of supper still spread out.
Behind them, the Wolfwood was shrouded in the blue and violet shadows of the Purple Hour and Snizort could hear the night rustlings and scurryings and patterings of tiny woodland creatures.
But within the clearing it was warm and safe-feeling; Clumhach had lit their usual fire, which was burning up brightly, and somebody had placed a cauldron of spiced wine to simmer over it.
Snizort thought that this was probably the time of day that the Beastline enjoyed best; supping at the long oak table, making plans to regain Tara, drinking spiced wine or mead.
At his side, Oisin said gently, ‘It is how we lived at Tara.’
‘Yes?’ said Snizort, who had forgotten this business of having your thoughts overheard.
‘The days were spent in — oh, many things,’ said Oisin, his dark, velvety eyes far away.
‘Hunting, perhaps, or travelling.
Chasing the white stag through the forests — never catching it, of course, for it is a — a creature of legend, the white stag.’
‘Yes.
Do go on,’ said Snizort, reaching for a newly sharpened charcoal stick.
‘Perhaps there would be guests to be welcomed — travellers, or merchants from the East who would display their wares of silk or gold or ivory,’ said Oisin.
‘Perhaps there would be studying for some of us, discourse with the druids or the sorcerers.
For those who held Office under the King-that is, Chancellorships or Council positions — there might be meetings in the Star of the Poets.’
He looked at Snizort to make sure that Snizort understood and Snizort at once said, ‘Yes, we had our own governing people in Renascia.
A Council of Nine we called it.’
‘Nine is interesting,’ said Oisin, thoughtfully.
‘It is a very mystical and very powerful number, although twelve is more frequently found.
Although there are only six of us here now, once there were Twelve Royal Houses.’
He indicated the twelve carved thrones at the edges of the clearing, set into the immense Trees.
‘I do not know when those were carved,’ he said.
‘Our legends say that it was at the same time as the great Ebony Throne of Ireland.’
‘That is inside Tara?’
‘No.
No, the Ebony Throne is lost to us, as so much else is lost to us,’ said Oisin.
‘I understand,’ said Snizort, who had lived in a world where entire civilisations had been lost and who had spent his life searching for fragments of them.
‘It happened not all at once, you understand,’ said Oisin.
‘Not as it happened to your people, in one immense disaster.
It happened naturally, over many years, and always sadly.
Our people were killed in battles such as the great CuChulainn of the Chariot Horses at the Battle against the Erl-King in the High King Cormac's time.
Sometimes they embarked on quests and did not return.
Sometimes they were taken by the Dark Lords and imprisoned for ever in the Black Ireland.
There were many causes and many reasons and nothing lasts for ever.
And so now there are only six Royal Houses.’
‘That is very sad,’ said Snizort.
‘But twelve has always been a number of great meaning to us,’ said Oisin.
‘You will find it repeatedly.
We have the Twelve Sacred Couches of Conchobar in the Hall of Light within Tara.
And there were the twelve evil Lords who served the necromancer Medoc.
And twelve stone idols surrounding the ancient monster-god, Crom Croich.’
Snizort, on his own account, offered the Twelve Knights who had sat at a round table so that no one of them should be at its head and no one at its foot.
‘That's something I've never come across,’ said Oisin, his expression absorbed and interested.
‘And there were the Twelve Companions of Odysseus and the Twelve faithful Apostles,’ said Snizort.
‘And we know that our ancestors kept twelve days of revelry for some feast or other.
We tried to keep those as well, in memory of them, although we did not know which part of the year they had their twelve days.’
‘Perhaps,’ said Oisin, ‘our worlds are not so very far apart.’
‘Go on about Tara,’ said Snizort.
‘Oh, Tara,’ said Oisin and the sudden, slightly mischievous grin  liked his face.
‘It was said to be the most brilliant Court in the western world.
And although the days would be taken up with working and hunting and discussions, every evening we would gather in the Sun Chamber and every evening there would be a banquet of some kind.
We would eat and drink and there would be entertainments and music and dancing and stories.
Travellers and pilgrims and men of unknown cultures and religions would be there, for no one was ever turned away, and every creature was welcomed and given food and shelter and his story listened to.
You and your friends would have been accorded places of honour,’ said Oisin, ‘for certainly you have one of the strangest stories ever told.’
Oisin had managed to bring a number of books and chronicles out of Tara and Snizort had studied these during the afternoons.
Eogan had told Snizort about the ritual mating between Humans and beasts, which could only be done under the strict control of the Court Sorcerers and the Panel of Judges, and Snizort had been entranced.
‘It's fascinating,’ he said, scribbling away busily.
‘Now, have I got it quite right?
I don't want to make any mistakes.
Every fourth or possibly fifth generation, the youngest son or daughter of each house has to appear before the Panel of Judges —’
‘Sometimes it's longer than four or five generations,’ said Feradach.
‘It depends on the strength of the blood, of course,’ said Dian Cecht.
‘My family could go for seven generations,’ said Clumhach.
‘In fact, I once had a third cousin — or was it a great-aunt…?’
‘If the Bloodline is judged to have weakened, then the Ritual is ordered,’ said Eogan.
‘The — dear me — the actual mating with a fox or a —’
‘Yes,’ said Oisin, and smiled.
‘Contrary to what you would think, it is rather a solemn occasion.’
‘I think it's unnatural,’ said Miach, rather defiantly, from the other end of the table and Dian Cecht shuddered.
‘So unpleasant,’ she murmured.
‘And to one who has been delicately reared —’
‘Of course,’ said Feradach loudly, ‘you do get the occasional bastard outside the Enchantment.
They're frequently mutants, because of the mating being done without the protection of the Enchantment.
But sometimes it works.’
‘Like Nuadu,’ said Dian Cecht urbanely.
‘Well yes.’
Oisin had drawn breath to respond to this, when Eogan, who had been looking towards the forest, suddenly said, ‘What's that?’
‘What?’
‘There's something moving in the Forest!’
‘I expect it's the sidh , isn't it?’
‘The sidh are out there,’ said Feradach, looking searchingly into the trees.
‘But Eogan's right.
There's something else out there as well.
Something that isn't the sidh .
Can't you hear it?’
‘Yes,’ said Oisin, after a moment.
‘There's something moving in the shadows.
Something huge…’
They were all scanning the forest's depths now and Snizort saw that  a sudden stillness and an intense wariness had stolen over them, as if whatever was moving out there in the Forest was strange and alien and menacing.
Feradach and Eogan had both been right.
Deep within the shadows of the Wolfwood, there were unmistakable movements; not ordinary movements as if somebody was walking quite normally and openly through the Trees, or even furtive movements as if somebody was creeping along, dodging between the trees, hoping not to be seen.
It might have been very nearly normal if the movements had been like that.
Snizort thought you might very nearly expect creatures, beings, anything at all, to steal through a darkling forest and lie watching the strange group of people eating supper and drinking wine in the glow from the fire.
The movements were fumbling and searching and somehow groping.
It was as if there was something out there — or perhaps several somethings — struggling to break free of a force that had held them for a very long time.
Things that had been yoked, harnessed, held down and held back by a power that was dissolving.
Things that had for centuries slept without stirring, but that were now stirring and waking and might, at any moment, come prowling through the forest…
Here and there they could see long, reaching arms, struggling dark shapes, the occasional ripple of something that was touched with silver by the moonlight, but that might be green-tinted and golden by day…
It was the most remarkable thing any of them had ever witnessed.
It was strong and deeply magical and filled with power and enchantment and with the twilit scents and the dusk-laden sounds that were part of the ancient Wolfwood.
From somewhere quite close by they could all hear the faint, unearthly singing of the sidh and Snizort caught glimpses of blue-green iridescence and of shimmering wings beating on the air.
‘Yes, the sidh are close to us,’ said Tealtaoich softly, when Snizort touched his arm and nodded towards the sounds.
‘They are singing the Tree Spirits back into the world.’
‘Is that something they always do?’
‘Oh yes,’ said Tealtaoich, his eyes on the shadowy forest and the struggling Tree Spirits.
‘Oh yes, they would pour out their music for something so magical as this.’
The Tree Spirits were discernible now; it was as if they had broken through a thick veil, through a smothering black curtain, and they were recognisable as distinct forms, moving slowly in and out of the forest.
The Purple Hour had come and gone and it was full night now, so that moonlight lay across the forest, gleaming coldly, silvering the outlines of the Trees and the silhouettes of the awakening naiads and dryads.
There were more of them now.
Oisin, who knew a little of the theory of sorcery —‘Although I have never aspired to its practice,’ he would have said modestly — knew that with the emerging of the first, the others would have gained strength and confidence.
He knew, as well, that Tree Spirits cling tenaciously to their homes until those homes become untenable because of the Tree dying and drying and he  thought that Miach's spell must have been stronger than any of them had thought for it to draw the Spirits so filly and so firmly into the open.
The Tree Naiads and Dryads were a curious blending of flesh and skin and muscle and bark and tree and leaf.
You could not be quite sure where the Tree part ended and the Human part began, although nobody was sure if Tree Spirits possessed any Human blood.
Most people thought they did not.
In the main, the Spirits were Oaks; solid, not young forms, with rather benevolent and scholarly expressions.
Their arms were half arms and half branches and their faces were part of the trunk part of the Tree.
They did not have hair, but trailing fronds of leaves and bracken.
The Elms, who seemed to stand next in line, were plain and sturdy, with pale-ish bark for skin and a good deal of greenery.
They stayed close to the Oaks, as if they considered it their duty, and they looked as if they might find life a serious business.
In between the Oaks and the Elms darted the Silver Birches, slender and frivolous-looking, with wild, shining white hair that streamed out behind them and mischievous features and trailing garments that might have been some kind of cloth, but might as easily have been simply their pale leaves.
The watchers thought that the Silver Birches would certainly be a bit wild and probably without any moral sense at all and Clumhach thought he must remember to tell everyone about his great uncle who had succumbed to a Silver Birch one scandalous afternoon.
It would not do to forget something so interesting.
The Copper Beech Naiads were the most beautiful creatures any of them had ever seen.
They were exquisite, rather fearless-looking creatures with manes of flowing red gold hair and skin the colour of an autumn sunset, long narrow eyes and slender, graceful arms and feet.
As Snizort and the Court sat, barely moving, the Trees seemed to become aware of the watchers and, one by one, ceased to move and turned to regard them.
A great hush fell over the entire Wolfwood, as if , thought Snizort, every living creature knew or heard or sensed what had happened and was waiting to see what the Trees would do.
And I believe the Trees are judging us, thought Snizort.
They've broken free and they're turning to see what kind of creatures called them out of their enchanted sleep.
They're inspecting us and they're considering what we are and whether we're all right.
Tealtaoich said, very softly, ‘You know, one of us must approach them.’
‘Yes,’ said several voices, rather doubtfully.
‘Had it better be me?’
‘Well, you're next after Nuadu,’ said Feradach.
‘Yes, but he didn't actually say —’
‘He wouldn't,’ said Eogan, his eyes still on the Trees.
‘He never accepted the leadership of us all, not officially.
He wouldn't appoint anyone to lead in his absence.’
‘Because he didn't care?’ asked Clumhach anxiously.
‘No.
Because he cared too much.
And Tealtaoich is nearer to the Wolfkings than any of us.
He's the King's cousin.’
‘I should not dream of putting myself forward in any way at all,’ said Dian Cecht.
‘But I do think that someone of authority should go into the forest and approach the Tree Spirits.’
‘All right,’ said Tealtaoich, suddenly.
‘I'll do it.’
He stood up and moved stealthily and warily forward and Snizort saw, for the first time, the sleek, feline grace.
Tealtaoich was not exactly padding into the forest and he was not precisely slinking into it either.
But the impression of dark, catlike prowling was there; the image of fur-covered paws and of sheathed claws and lashing tail.
Snizort glanced at the others and saw in each of them, now, faintly but definitely the unmistakable traces of their lineage.
as if something within them had sharpened to awareness, or perhaps as if the darkling forest had wakened their strange ancestry and quenched the Human side of them.
I suppose it is all right, he thought.
I suppose we are right to throw in our lot with them.
But there was no time to give this disturbing idea attention; Tealtaoich was nearly at the Trees and the Trees were grouped together watching him and waiting for him in complete silence and it was important not to miss a single instant of any of it.
Tealtaoich had moved with a soft, measured tread towards the flowing, twining shapes, not once hesitating.
‘And,’ said Oisin softly, ‘it's actually quite brave of him.
We none of us know if the Trees are safe or not.’
‘Tealtaoich is far braver than he'd like you to think,’ said Feradach.
Tealtaoich had passed through the twisting shadows and was standing facing the Trees now, a slender, solitary figure, silhouetted darkly against the massive solidity of the Oaks and the flowing silver-tipped hair of the Birches and the cascading russet leaf-hair of the Copper Beeches.
The Tree Spirits were a great deal taller than Tealtaoich and, from out of the blending, shifting, gold and green and russet, their eyes were ancient and wise and beautiful.
‘And watchful,’ thought Snizort.
‘Bless my soul, they are certainly not to be lightly regarded, these creatures.’
Behind the Spirits they could see the shapes of the Trees themselves, stark and empty-looking, rather dark and brooding, like abandoned houses whose windows stare blindly and blankly.
The Oak Naiads were at the centre of the group, with the Elms in attendance.
They're Elders, thought Snizort.
The Oaks are the Elders of the Forest and the others are aware of it.
They'll all have opinions and ideas and suggestions, but it'll be the Oaks who decide and the rest will bow to their decision.
The Silver Birches looked rather fun.
They seemed to giggle and shrug and eye Tealtaoich mischievously and be unable to decide where they would like to sit.
They darted about on the front of the group, their silver-leaf hair rustling like raw silk.
On the edges of the Trees, the Copper Beech Naiads had simply sunk to the ground, their hair falling about their bodies in rich cascades of colour, making pools of glowing russet and brown all about them.
They fixed their huge unreadable golden eyes on Tealtaoich.
The Trees seemed to be waiting for Tealtaoich to make the first  move and the largest of the Oaks had inclined their heads quite courteously.
‘But,’ said Clumhach in one of his huge whispers, ‘you get the feeling that you could easily be made to feel a fool by them, don't you?’
‘Speak for yourself,’ said Oisin, to whom this remark happened to have been directed.
‘Those Silver Birches don't look very reliable.
Still, I'd rather have them with us than against us,’ added Feradach.
Tealtaoich stood quite still, regarding the waiting Trees and seeing that they were listening and apparently politely prepared to hear anything he had to say.
‘You are well come,’ he said at last, and the Trees inclined their heads again.
‘They'll like that,’ murmured Oisin to Snizort.
‘It's the ancient welcoming Ritual and, in all of the stories, the Tree Spirits set very great store by rituals.
And they'll like the fact that it's a Prince of Ireland who has been sent to talk to them.’
Tealtaoich, facing the Tree Spirits, was remembering this as well.
Then, hoping he could remember enough of the ancient language of chivalry and selecting his words with extreme care, he said, ‘Good Trees, we ask your assistance,’ and saw the Elms nod to one another meaningfully, as if they had been expecting all along to be asked to do something for the Humans.
‘Tara is in the hands of the Dark Powers,’ said Tealtaoich, hoping that this was the correct thing to say, because nobody had seemed quite sure which side the Trees would be on.
‘It is in thrall to a Necromancer of the highest order and the Wolfking is dead.’
There was a rustle of emotion at this.
The Beeches drooped their beautiful heads and their copper leaf-hair rippled across the forest floor.
The Elms looked at them rather disapprovingly and then turned back to Tealtaoich.
Tealtaoich said, ‘You have always been on the side of justice, Trees; come with us and fight with us and for us, as you have done in the past.’
He lifted his voice slightly.
‘Come with us and help us to beat back the Dark Ireland once again.’
A pause.
‘Once before,’ said Tealtaoich, reaching into his memory, ‘once before, you answered the Wolfkings’cry for help.
It is a part of our history, that, and a part which we revere greatly.
Once before, you rose up from the great forests of Ireland and came to the aid of our greatest King of all, Cormac of the Wolves.
You turned the tide of a battle then, centuries ago.
‘We have kept that memory with us ever since and we have always believed that the Trees would ever be on the side of the Wolfkings and the Beastline and the One True Ireland.’
He paused for breath.
‘Will you fight with us and for us again?’ said Tealtaoich.
‘Will you come with us to Tara and help us sweep to victory?
Will you fight for the descendants of the great Cormac and his daughter Dierdriu and the descendants of Grainne the Gentle and of Erin and of Niall of the Nine Hostages?
And of all the Wolfkings and Queens who have made Ireland great?’
Tealtaoich paused again and stood waiting and a murmur of  approval went through the others.
Feradach whispered to Oisin that you had to give credit where it was due; Tealtaoich really did this sort of thing extremely well.
‘Yes, but I don't know if he's reaching them,’ said Oisin, his eyes on Tealtaoich's slight form.
‘They're rather overpowering, aren't they?’
The Trees seemed to be thinking Tealtaoich's words over and Tealtaoich, still standing before them, received the impression that they might be somehow conferring with one another in some silent fashion of their own.
The Oaks bent their branchy heads closer and the Silver Birches rippled and chattered.
And then the largest of the Oaks moved forward and Tealtaoich saw that he had the high, domed forehead of a scholar and a thinker and that his ancient eyes held wisdom and knowledge.
‘Son of the Wild Panthers,’ said the Oak, in a warm, woodsy sort of voice, ‘son of one of Ireland's most ancient Bloodlines, is it solely to ask our help that you have woken us?’
Tealtaoich thought, rather grimly, that this was a nasty one.
They had woken the Trees only so that they could ask for their help, of course.
As he hesitated, searching for the proper words, the Oak spoke again.
‘We have slept the enchanted slumber, the Draoicht Suan , for many centuries,’ it said.
‘You will know of our history and you will know that we were sent into that slumber many hundreds of years ago, by the Dark Lords who held sway in the reign of the High King Cormac.’
‘I do know,’ said Tealtaoich, and thought there was a note of reproof in the Oak's tone, as if the Tree Spirits were angry at being summoned like this.
They are not going to help us, he thought, and knew a rush of complete despair.
The Oak said, ‘But we have lent our aid to the Royal Houses of the Beastline in times of extreme danger and we have also fought to regain Tara for the rightful heir.’
The rightful heir…
Taken and imprisoned and held fast in the black depths of the Dark Ireland.
I wonder if they know about that, thought Tealtaoich.
But he only said, ‘Will you join with us?’ and looked at the Oak very straightly.
There was a pause, and the Oak seemed to study him afresh with solemn, scholarly eyes.
‘Ireland is threatened by a terrible force,’ it said, and the listening Court held their breath.
‘It is menaced by the evil CuRoi and by the Robemaker.’
At the mention of the Robemaker, a shiver went through the Trees.
‘We know it and we feel it,’ said the Oak.
‘We do not promise to help you, Son of the Panthers.
But we will attend a Council of War and hear your plans.
If we believe that Ireland can be purged of the Dark Lords and the Wolfline reinstated, then we will join with you.’
The Oak regarded Tealtaoich severely.
‘For,’ it said, ‘unless the Wolfline is reinstated, Ireland is surely doomed for generations to come.’
Chapter Twenty-two
Floy and Snodgrass, with Balor accompanying them, set out from Tara at noon the next day.
‘Carrying,’ said Goibniu, ‘the new marriage proposal, and the designs for Flame's jewels.’
The new proposals contained a revised list of the territories the Gruagach were prepared to cede to Reflection in exchange for her daughter but Caspar, who had managed to get a look at these, had told Floy that the Gruagach were only ceding some barren bits of wasteland surrounding the Robemaker's workshops, the Lake of Dhairbhreach — which nobody in their right minds would want — and a mountain or two.
‘It looks quite good on paper,’ he said.
‘In fact, it looks very generous.
But it's nothing more than a double-cross, really.
Goibniu will never give away anything that is worth a button.’
The Gnomes had rolled the designs for the new Crown Jewels into cylinders and packed them carefully into long, hollow tubes, which they had brought with them for the purpose.
‘Best copper on gold,’ said Bith of the Bog-Hat.
‘Engraved with tongues of flame,’ said Flaherty, who had thought up this himself and did not want it overlooked.
‘I did the engraving,’ said Culdub Oakapple.
‘What you do is, you heat up an iron spike —’
‘Don't let Floy forget the chart of colours.’
‘— until it's so hot it's white —’
‘And there's the pearl diadem we made, just as a bit of a gift —’
— I blistered my thumbs on it —’
Floy said, ‘I shall not forget anything and I feel sure that Reflection and Flame will be greatly impressed by your sketches.’
The Gnomes broke into wide grins at this and said wasn't impressing the thing and Floy in the right of it, and impress was what they'd set out to do and hadn't Floy the way with words?
‘And if,’ said Bith of the Bog-Hat, ‘your impress-ship should ever be wanting an armlet or two, or maybe a plain everyday crown circlet, we'd be happy to oblige.’
The Gnomes chimed in, saying to be sure they would, obliging was what they were, and it the best thing of all to be, leave aside impressing, which was just as important.
‘And so,’ said Floy, looking at Fenella, wondering how all this might have been received on Renascia, ‘and so, we will set off.’
Fenella looked at Floy and remembered about the Robemaker and the way he had captured Nuadu and rendered them all helpless, and  about the exiled Court and the sidh and the Tree Spirits that Miach had almost awoken, and which might turn out not to be friends, but enemies.
And thought: and Floy is going off into the midst of all these and it is perfectly possible that I shall never see him again.
But it would not do to show any emotion before the giants, who had all gathered to see Floy and Snodgrass off, or before Balor, who was waiting in high good humour at the unexpected excitement of a journey to the Fire Court.
And so Fenella said, ‘I wish you a safe journey,’ and was pleased that her voice came out firm and perfectly calm, as if she was quite accustomed to seeing her brother off on a journey to the Court of a Sorceress, which would take him past all manner of weird and darkly enchanted places.
‘And a speedy return,’ said Caspar, winking plumply on the side that the giants could not see.
‘That's important.
A speedy return.’
They were to depart from the Western Gate.
‘Which,’ said Caspar, ‘is where all important journeys start from.’
‘It will be our first real sight of Ireland,’ said Floy to Caspar, as if there was nothing more on his mind other than surveying the land they were about to travel through.
He stood for a moment, framed in the great gateway, and Fenella saw how the early morning light touched his dark hair and brought out red glints in it and saw, as well, that his eyes were shining, as if he was already looking ahead to the dangers and the adventures.
Yes, perhaps it will be all right.
Of course it will be all right.
Snodgrass was discussing with the Gnomes the best route to take and Caspar was making sure that they had packed the maps and Inchbad and Goll the Gorm and Arca Dubh were nodding and smiling and, of course, there was nothing sinister in their smiles — and there was certainly nothing in the least sinister in the way that Goibniu was looking at Fenella, thumbs hooked in his belt, his wide greedy mouth curving into a satisfied grin…
Balor was going to let down the drawbridge so that they could ride across it.
‘Seeing that it's a special occasion,’ he said, and Goibniu had procured two horses for Floy and Snodgrass to ride.
Balor would walk, because giants did not ride.
‘There aren't horses that would carry them,’ muttered Caspar.
‘And on horseback you'll get a better chance of losing him.’
The provision of horses was unexpected, but curiously cheering, because it seemed to show that the giants were sending Floy and Snodgrass off in reasonable style, as if they expected them to return.
‘Of course you will return,’ said Goibniu.
‘The lady will be here, waiting for you.’
There was another of the smiling glances at Fenella.
‘She will entertain us every evening after supper,’ said Goibniu and Floy nearly abandoned the entire thing there and then, because there had been something so meaningful in the way that Goibniu had said entertain that he wondered how they could ever have considered leaving her here alone.
‘I suppose,’ said Floy, thoughtfully, fixing Caspar with an equally meaningful stare, ‘that we can trust you, can we?’and Caspar said, ‘Oh, for the — Floy, I've been trying to get away from these creatures ever  since they took Tara!
We'll meet you on the road leading to Lake Dhairbhreach as we arranged.’
‘Yes,’ said Floy.
‘All right.’
Neither Floy nor Snodgrass had ever actually seen a horse, let alone ridden one.
‘But it is not really so very difficult,’ said Snodgrass, after he was hoisted into the saddle and discovered how to take up the reins.
Floy stood where he was for a moment, looking up at the great, shining edifice that was Tara, Ireland's Bright Palace, the great legendary Citadel of Light, the home of the Wolfkings…
Shall I ever see this again ?
And then, with a pang of real anguish:shall I ever see Fenella again ? he thought.
But there was nothing to be done; Goibniu had made it a request that Floy and Snodgrass travel to the Fire Court leaving Fenella alone.
It had been courteously framed, but Goibniu had arranged for Balor to go with them and Floy had known — and everyone had known — that it had not really been a request but a command.
There was a quick, rather fierce embrace.
‘Go safely, Floy,’ whispered Fenella, who thought it safer not to say more, and then one of the stable hands brought the second horse forward and Floy found, as Snodgrass had, that it was actually quite easy to spring into the saddle and it was rather a safe feeling to be seated astride a horse like this.
And then the drawbridge was falling, with a clanking and a whirring of machinery and the light was pouring into the courtyard and the Gnomes were cheering and the giants were nodding to one another, and there was nothing for it but to ride away with Snodgrass, with Balor loping along at their side, with Fenella behind in the hands of the Gruagach.
It was a rather dreadful feeling to know you were alone inside a castle of giants.
Fenella, tidying her hair for supper, thought she had never felt quite so alone in her life.
Probably everything would be all right and probably there was nothing to be afraid of.
Probably Inchbad and the others would be extremely friendly and entirely courteous.
Also, the Gnomes would still be there.
Fenella, who had almost forgotten about this, was cheered, because it was impossible to be afraid (well, almost impossible) with Bith and Culdub and Flaherty and the rest of them.
Caspar came to collect her before supper.
‘In case you miss your way,’ he said, but Fenella had heard the key turn in the lock earlier and knew she was still being treated as a prisoner.
Supper was rather an odd meal.
Fenella was seated next to Inchbad, who patted her hand and said she was a pretty little thing, but seemed preoccupied.
Goll the Gorm sat on her left and devoted all his attention to the food and Goibniu was two seats down.
The Gnomes sat at the far table, eating and drinking happily, whiling away an amiable half hour by telling anyone who would listen the entire history of the Crown Jewels and the history of the Gallan forges.
Flaherty took a drop more of the giants' mulled wine than was good for him and very nearly disgraced his fellows by reciting an extremely improper poem, describing the exploits of a fair maiden who had fallen foul of a wicked and lustfully intentioned knight, but who had then escaped by invoking  a demon who withered the knight's passion.
The Gnomes thought this very funny and Caspar laughed loudly but Inchbad and the giants missed the point.
‘Stupid,’ mouthed Caspar at Fenella, under cover of the serving of half a dozen roast boars.
‘I told you.
We ought to be able to creep out easily when they're all asleep,’ he added and Fenella frowned at him, because they could not risk the giants guessing what they intended to do.
They were three quarters of the way through the meal when Caspar, who did not miss anything any of the giants said and who had, in fact, long since perfected the art of listening to three different conversations at once, suddenly went rather white and made frantic gestures to Fenella.
‘What's the matter?’ said Fenella as Caspar trotted round to her chair, under cover of bringing round a Human-sized bowl of fruit.
‘And do, for heavens’ sake, be watchful or they'll suspect us of collusion.’
‘What's that?’ said Caspar.
And then, ‘No, don't tell me, we haven't got time.’
He took a deep breath and glanced round at the giants.
‘They're going to celebrate the Fidchell again,’ he said.
‘Yes?’
‘Yes.
With you and the gnomes.
They're not overly partial to gnomes, but they think it's too good an opportunity to miss.’
‘But they were going to wait for Floy to get back!
I was going to tell them about Renascia and the Angry Sun and —’ Fenella trailed into silence, staring at Caspar.
‘They aren't going to wait for Floy to come back,’ said Caspar.
‘In fact, from what Goibniu said, I rather think they don't expect him to get back at all.’
‘Oh,’ said Fenella, suddenly feeling rather sick.
‘But that means —’ And stopped.
‘It means,’ said Caspar, ‘that you and the Gnomes are going to be impaled on spikes and partly roasted on the Fidchell board.
And then you'll be finished off in the sculleries.
‘And then they'll eat you,’ said Caspar, and Fenella stared at him in horror.
It was difficult to make the Gnomes understand.
Caspar and Fenella had to explain it four times, and a fifth for Flaherty, who was still recovering from his overindulgence in the matter of the mulled wine.
To begin with, the Gnomes thought it a fine idea to be part of the traditional Fidchell and Bith of the Bog-Hat told how the Wolfkings had played it during the Winter Solstice with solid gold figures studded with ivory and pearl, which the Gnomes always had the supplying of.
Flaherty said to be sure this was true, although he misremembered the last time they'd been called on to supply them, it being all of two years since the Wolfkings had been driven out by the Gruagach.
It was all very difficult.
‘And dangerous,’ said Caspar, with a backwards glance to where Goibniu was standing before the fire in thy characteristic pose, thumbs in belt, surrounded by half a dozen or so of the others.
He got down to  the serious matter of explaining to the gnomes that the intricate, almost scholarly,Fidchell that the Wolfkings had enjoyed, bore no resemblance to the horrid gruesome version that the Gruagach played.
Fenella was watching the giants, feeling cold inside at the way in which they all kept glancing slyly in her direction.
There had to be something they could do.
‘Couldn't the gnomes do something?’ she said.
‘Bith, Culdub, can't you think of something we can do?
You know more about this kind of thing than I do.
What do people do when they're threatened by giants?’
‘If we don't do something extremely soon,’ said Caspar, who was watching the giants furtively, ‘they'll be heating up the squares any minute.’
One of the older Gnomes, who had a face like a wrinkled nutcracker and bright twinkly eyes, asked would a bit of magic be of any use anywhere, because wasn't magic a powerful thing when you had a difficulty, and the other Gnomes said to be sure it was.
Caspar said crossly, ‘Well,of course it would be of use, only we haven't got any.’
The Gnome, whose name was Pumlumon said, ‘But of course we have,’ and the Gnomes all shook their heads sadly, and did not know what things were coming to when Humans did not remember about Gnomes having any magic.
Fenella, trying to keep her voice low, so that Goibniu and the others would not hear it, said, ‘But what sort of magic, Pumlumon?’ and Pumlumon beamed and said weren't there all kinds.
‘But if it's the giants you're wanting to fool, then it'd be the grand old Draoicht Suan ,’ said Pumlumon, and the Gnomes nodded sagely and said that would be it, the Draoicht Suan it would be, the spell that had kept the Trees fast asleep for so many years now, and wasn't it a powerful strong spell and Pumlumon the fellow to be spinning it for them all?
‘Well, what does it do?’ asked Fenella, who was by no means sure about trusting an enchantment and who did not like the way Goibniu and Fiachra Broadcrown were flipping coins and chuckling sinisterly over the results.
Pumlumon said in a voice of utmost astonishment, ‘But has your honour never heard of the Draoicht Suan ?’ and was instantly hushed by Bith of the Bog-Hat, who had by now sensed that something was wrong, being a gnome of more percipience than his fellows and who liked, no more than Fenella, the manner in which Goibniu was eyeing them all.
He told the others they must not forget about roast Gnome being a traditional dish for the Gruagach's grander festivals.
Such as a wedding feast, said Bith severely.
‘It's the Enchantment of Slumber,’ said Pumlumon.
‘It sends your enemies into the deepest of sleeps.
My word, I'm surprised that your worshipfulness has never come across it.
At one time, you couldn't travel more than a half day across Ireland without coming across the Draoicht Suan in one form or another.
Well, that's what keeps the Trees from waking,’ said Pumlumon, looking solemn.
‘And if we're to outwit these giants, there's nothing for it but for me to call up the  Draoicht Suan .
We'll send the giants into the enchanted slumber and be off back to Gallan in the whisk of a glowworm's tail.’
He beamed at them again and Caspar was beginning to relax, because it seemed as if they might escape after all and Fenella was remembering about magic being very nearly everyday here, when Pumlumon said, ‘Of course, that's so long as I can remember the words.’
He thought he probably would.
He said there was not much of it to remember, really.
Wasn't it one of the simplest magics there was and his grandfather, to say nothing of his great-grandfather (who had lived long and fared well) passing it down to him.
Why, said Pumlumon, hadn't there been a time, not so very long ago either, when he could rattle off the words that set the Draoicht Suan working with no more ado than you might make in the squashing of a flea, always supposing you wanted to do something so pointless, which Pumlumon himself never had.
‘But you can remember it all?’ said Fenella, anxiously, and Pumlumon pushed his hat well back and scratched his head and said once he got it going, it would follow as the night the day, or maybe it was the other way round.
‘The thing is getting it going,’ he said.
‘If I could have a few minutes — let's say half an hour — to think it over and make some notes, I daresay we'll be as right as a snail's whisker.’
‘But we haven't got half an hour,’ said Fenella.
‘They'll be bringing up the squares at any minute.
You'll have to pronounce it at once.’
‘Yes, but we want to get it the right way about,’ said Pumlumon.
‘It won't do to be saying it backwards, or inside out, or to be missing a bit out that's important, or adding a piece from another enchantment.
Bless my best boots, that would never do at all.
I'll just recite it through quietly to be sure I can remember it first, shall I?’
‘We'll have to distract the giants, then,’ said Fenella practically.
‘Supposing I offer to tell them about the Feargach Grian ?’
The Gnomes thought this a fine old idea.
In fact, Flaherty thought it was a better idea than invoking the Draoicht Suan until it was explained to him that unless Pumlumon did invoke it, they would all of them be roasting on spits in the Gruagach's sculleries before the night was out, to which he said that giants had always been partial to roast Gnome and he had always thought it was a mistake to come to Tara in the first place.
‘Give me a few moments,’ said Pumlumon, setting his features in a frown of concentration and Fenella looked at Caspar with a have-we-any-choice expression and then, taking a deep breath, walked across to the group of giants by the fire.
Inchbad was pleased to see Fenella, pretty little thing, approach them.
Of course, it was probably quite an ordeal for Humans to sup with giants, although Inchbad was pleased to think that they had all treated Fenella and the other two with courtesy.
The Gruagach were strong on courtesy; Inchbad had always been very firm about this, even to the extent of feeding prisoners before the Fidchell which Goibniu had always said was a waste of good food and wine.
But it paid off in the end; here was the pretty little Girl-Human walking over to talk to them, smiling up at them — Inchbad always noticed the fair, smooth skins of humans, whereas giantesses were apt to be a bit coarse and occasionally had incipient beards.
You could not really beat a Human's skin.
Inchbad found himself thinking he would rather like to stroke Fenella.
Perhaps they should reserve tonight's Fidchell solely for the Gnomes.
Nobody wanted to stroke a Gnome, except perhaps another Gnome, He thought he might just have a word with Caspar to see if Fenella could be brought along to his, Inchbad's, bed that very night.
Goibniu would have had his eye on her, but that was just too bad.
Goibniu would have to wait his turn.
There was really no reason why the Girl-Human could not be brought to all their bed-chambers, one after the other, before she was used in the Fidchell .
This was an eminently reasonable arrangement and nobody could possibly object.
The Girl-Human had seated herself before the fire; Inchbad could see how the firelight fell across her face and brought out red lights in her hair.
He bent to hear what she was saying, because she had a rather soft voice.
Soothing you might call it.
The sort of voice you could just nod off to.
Yes, he would very much like to stroke her.
Face, neck, breasts…
Giantesses tended to have loose thick-grained breasts.
Inchbad was rather partial to a soft, tender Human breast.
He shifted in his seat a bit.
Yes, certainly Caspar would be told to make ready the royal bed-chamber tonight.
The Girl was explaining how she thought perhaps she ought to make some kind of thanks to them for their hospitality.
(Goibniu and Fiachra Broadcrown sniggered at this, but nobody took any notice.)
The Girl said that they had been so kind and welcoming; food all served to them and very good, too, and such comfortable bed-chambers for their use.
And they had expressed such interest in the Feargach Grian she was saying; as people of culture and learning, naturally they would be interested in it, she quite understood this.
This was appealing to everyone's better instincts and most of the giants looked alert and nodded at one another, because, of course , the Gruagach were known the length and breadth of Ireland for their culture and learning.
It had been really quite sharp of the pretty little Human to see that.
Perhaps a tale or two from other lands? the Girl was saying, smiling up at them.
In her own country, there had been a saying: ‘Singing for your Supper’.
She could not sing, she said, not really, but she could tell some stories for her supper.
Would that do?
And she smiled so nicely at Inchbad and Goibniu that everyone smiled back and thought it would be really very interesting to hear about some of the strange lands and the faraway worlds the Humans had visited from the great Feargach Grian , and also that it was always a shame to eat Humans when they were pretty and young and friendly.
And while nobody wanted precisely to abandon the Fidchell which everybody enjoyed so much, there was really no reason why they could not play it with the Gnomes tonight and save Fenella for tomorrow, or even the day after.
And so Inchbad sat down and beamed at Fenella and said they  would be interested to hear her stories and, at the same time, nodded to the waiting Fiachra Broadcrown to get the Fidchell squares ready for the Gnomes.
Fenella took a deep breath and, leaning forward, clasped her hands about her knees.
It was warm over here by the fire and there was an unpleasant stench of stale giant and the surreptitious breaking of wind from Goll the Gorm who had eaten too much onion broth again, but these things would have to be overlooked.
From the comer of her eye, she could see Pumlumon frowning and tapping his forehead for inspiration and the others standing in a worried circle about him.
Fenella began to speak at exactly the same moment that Pumlumon began to intone the Draoicht Suan .
To begin with, it did not seem as if anything was going to happen.
Caspar, who distrusted most magic on principle, thought that probably nothing would happen at all and the evening would end as so many evenings were ending lately; with the heating of the squares and the terrible screaming of the victims.
But Fenella seemed to have caught the Gruagach's interest fairly and squarely; Caspar, only partly listening, heard her telling them about another life, another world, where people had fled in panic from the Feargach Grian many centuries earlier and how the Feargach Grian had, on that occasion, appeared in one of its truly terrible aspects.
‘The Angry Sun in truth,’ said Fenella, her expression absorbed, her eyes fixed on Goibniu and the others.
Caspar saw Inchbad nodding and Goll the Gorm was utterly rapt.
Pumlumon seemed to have got himself quite well into the enchantment now; he was looking much less worried than he had looked ten minutes earlier.
(‘For doesn't it always come back?’ demanded Bith.
‘Isn't he the grand feller, chanting away, as if it was only yesterday he called up a spell or two?’)
Pumlumon set his hat more squarely on his head and continued.
Caspar, sending a worried glance to the group around the fire, heard Fenella describing something called Renascia; Twilight Mountains and Seasons with different colours.
Something about an Iron Casket that had held secrets of the Ancient Past…
It might have been extremely interesting if Caspar had not been so worried about Pumlumon's knowledge of the spell.
Oughtn't it to be working by now.)
Fenella, seated by the fire, trying not to flinch from onion-tainted breath and unwashed feet (there was something particularly revolting about the thought of giants' feet and their toenails), thought so as well.
Inchbad had moved across to sit beside her and had taken her hand between his finger and thumb and was exclaiming what a pretty little thing she was and it the shame of the world that her brother had had to ride of land leave her all alone.
‘But I'll console you, my dear,’ he said and Fenella smiled valiantly and tried to quell the nauseous lifting of her stomach.
‘That would be nice, but shan't I tell you about the Fire Country of Fael-Inis now?’
It might be as well to sound a bit childish, and even  slightly simple.
‘Or,’ said Fenella, hopefully, ‘should we save it for tomorrow?’
Goibniu opened his mouth to say something — Fenella wondered what it would have been — when an arrested look came into his small eyes.
Into the great Sun Chamber, the legendary crystal and silver hall, the place the exiled Wolfkings had called Medchuana , stole something so delicate and so strong, and so — so beckoning thought Fenella hazily — that it was almost as if a thin, sugar-spun veil was falling over them.
There was a faint sticky feeling to it, as if it might trap you if you tried to struggle against it — but no one would want to struggle against this, thought Fenella, bemused with delight.
For a moment, she thought she could see it: fragile silver filaments of enchantment, gentle brittle frost-webs of something that was not quite light, but not quite solid, but somehow composed of both.
The Enchantment of Slumber…gentle and strong and wrapping itself about you…
And within the enchantment are dreams, Mortal, within the enchantment are worlds within worlds within worlds and there are no longer boundaries and there are no longer the finite things that bind you …
Surrender now, Mortal, come in a the deep folds of slumber, where your heart's desire awaits you, where all things are possible…
Nuadu! thought Fenella, her mind tumbling with delight.
And Floy!
And all things are possible…
She gave a deep sigh and felt the silver threads spin filaments of pure light about her and the soft folds of slumber enveloping her…like a soft light veil, like a warm, wine-dark sea, like hazy afternoon sunlight…
And then felt, with a rude awakening, Caspar's hands shaking.
‘You can't give in to it,’ he was saying urgently.
‘Fenella, you must wake up —’ Fenella considered this and blinked.
And from a great distance, heard Caspar say with irritation, ‘Damn and blast, I knew we shouldn't have trusted those Gnomes —’
With a huge effort, Fenella said, ‘What's wrong with the Gnomes?’
And then, remembering a bit more, ‘Didn't Pumlumon manage the Enchantment?’
‘Very well indeed,’ said Caspar grimly.
‘Only he forgot to make sure that the gnomes kept out of range.
‘They're all fast asleep!’
‘How did we manage to escape it?’ asked Fenella.
‘Pumlumon was directing it straight at the giants,’ said Caspar.
‘I stood behind him, but you caught the outer edges of it.’
And then, curiously, ‘Did you see it?’ he said.
‘Well, I saw something,’ said Fenella rather uncertainly.
‘And I certainly felt something.
But I don't think it was as strong as it could have been.
I mean, I'm awake, aren't I?’
‘You were only on the outskirts of it,’ said Caspar.
‘But I don't think it was very strong.
I think the giants might wake up quite soon.
We'll have to be quick.
I suppose,’ he said, ‘that we can't just slip out now.
Just the two of us?’
‘And leave the Gnomes?’
Fenella was shocked.
‘No, of course we can't.
We'll have to wake them somehow.’
But the Gnomes could not be woken and, eventually, Caspar and Fenella gave up.
‘But we can't leave them,’ said Fenella worriedly.
‘Caspar, we can't .’
‘We could put them somewhere.’
‘Could we?
Where could we put them?’
‘In a locked room?’ said Caspar, half to himself, and then, with more assurance, ‘Yes, in a locked room.’
‘Won't they wake up and be angry?’
But Caspar said this was unlikely; the Draoicht Suan would probably keep everyone inside Tara asleep until somebody came along with the counter-spell.
‘And,’ he added gloomily, ‘who's to know when that will happen.
It might be a hundred years from now for all I know.’
In the end they hauled the Gnomes into a small ante-room across the galleried landing from the Sun Chamber.
‘Not ideal,’ said Caspar.
‘But it gives them a fighting chance.
I tell you what we'll do, we'll try to find someone on the way who knows the counter-spell and send him back to wake the Gnomes up.’
‘Can we do that?’
‘You never know,’ said Caspar rather vaguely.
‘I've known stranger things happen.’
And then, impatiently, ‘And now do come on, or we shall never get away.’
Chapter Twenty-three
In the end, it was relatively easy to steal through the darkened halls of Tara and out into the night.
‘Although Tara never is really dark,’ said Caspar as they stopped to look back at the great shining edifice outlined against the sky.
Fenella, who had found Tara a place of breathtaking beauty and who would have very much liked to explore it, saw how it gleamed gently against the night and seemed to have some inner radiance of its own.
‘I have seen it brighter,’ said Caspar in a rather expressionless voice.
‘Yes?’
‘When the Wolfkings rule,’ he said, and Fenella remembered Nuadu Airgetlam all over again and had to bite down the ache of loss.
They had stopped briefly in the great sculleries to pack up provisions.
‘For,’ said Caspar, ‘we shall need food and clothes.’
Fenella had gone back to the bed-chamber and pulled on her boots and found the warm woollen cloak she had brought from Renascia while Caspar had raided the sculleries and packed the maps.
‘Were they all asleep?’
Fenella asked as they stole through the quiet Palace.
‘Yes.
Pumlumon's spell must have been better than we thought.’
‘Where are we going?’
‘To the stables,’ said Caspar, sending her a surprised look.
‘You didn't suppose we were going to walk all the way to the Fire Court did you?’
‘I did, as a matter of fact,’ said Fenella, who had forgotten how Floy and Snodgrass had ridden out earlier.
‘I've never actually ridden a horse before.
I've never actually seen a horse until yesterday.’
Clambering on to the horse's back felt odd and briefly unsafe and then, unexpectedly, exhilarating.
Fenella, who on Renascia had walked everywhere, found her breath snatched from her as her mount followed Caspar down the great avenue of beeches that guarded Tara and out on to the Tree-fringed high road.
She thought she would have to hold on extremely tightly if they were to go any faster, but she thought it was a thrilling, intoxicating sensation to be borne along like this.
Moonlight was silvering the countryside as they rode slowly along, draining it of colour, and all about them were rustlings and scurryings and the impression of tiny pattering feet and the beating of small, unseen wings.
‘Only night creatures,’ said Caspar, ‘Squirrels and hedgehogs and owls.’
But he glanced over his shoulder as he said this, as if he was not entirely sure.
The huge mass of the Wolfwood sprawled darkly to their left, black and rather forbidding, a place of thick impenetrable shadows.
As they drew alongside, on the road they had travelled on their way to Tara, Fenella found herself staring into its depths and remembering the ancient Forest Court at its heart…
Croi Crua Adhmaid …the Place of Ancient Enchantments…the Heartwood of the Forest…
But out here, on the high road, it was difficult to recall the purple and blue shadows and the firelight and the long oak table where they had all taken supper.
It was very hard indeed to believe she had walked in there with a wolf creature and that he had drawn her down onto the forest floor and made love to her…
I won't think about it, said Fenella firmly.
I'll think instead about meeting up with Floy and Snodgrass and finding the Fire Court.
Yes, that was a much better way to think.
But the Wolfwood was not entirely in darkness.
As they rode cautiously along, Fenella caught glimpses of movement in between the trees.
Several times, there was the brilliant smudgy turquoise streak of the sidh and, more than once, the impression of gold and green and amber beings, neither quite human nor quite woodland.
Tree Spirits?
Oh I do hope so, thought Fenella, peering into the forest depths, trying to make out the shapes more clearly.
As they skirted the forest and came out on to a stretch of road fringed by slender copper beeches, Fenella had the feeling of something deep and ancient and strong moving all about them.
The Dryads and the Naiads waking?
But then the moon slid behind a cloud and the images vanished and Fenella thought that perhaps she had been mistaken.
She turned to say something about this to Caspar and then stopped and listened, because now — yes, surely — there was the faint eerily beautiful singing of the sidh .
‘Be wary of the sidh ,’ said Caspar as they skirted the Wolfwood.
‘And be very wary indeed of their music.
They are greedy for Humans, the sidh , and if they can once trap you with their music they will carry you down to the caves beneath the sea and steal one of your five senses and tear out your soul.’
But Fenella thought the sounds and the movements were not all the sidh .
Here and there, they caught sight of a fluid red-gold figure in between the trees and once a huge oak tree seemed to bend forward as if inclining its head to inspect them.
Delight rose in her, for surely these were Tree Spirits.
They did not stop to rest, because Caspar thought they should put as much distance as possible between them and the Gruagach.
‘They oughtn't to wake,’ he said, worriedly, ‘but you never know.
Let's get as far away as we can.’
This was clearly sensible so Fenella did not argue.
She had sorted out the reins now and Caspar had explained about just touching the horse's flanks with her heels to spur it to a gallop.
‘I won't try that yet,’ said Fenella, who was rather enjoying riding the horse, but was not sure how she might get on with whatever was a gallop.
‘I'll get a bit more accustomed first.’
And then, ‘Or if we hear the Gruagach following,’ she said.
‘I'll gallop then.’
Ahead of them would be the road that would lead to the Fire Court  of the sorceress Reflection and her daughter Flame.
They had studied the maps very carefully before setting out and Floy had marked out the way that he and Snodgrass would take.
It had looked quite straightforward, thought Fenella, who was not very used to maps and was still adjusting to the vastness of this world after small Renascia.
Floy had said he and Snodgrass would try their best to leave markers on the road as they went, providing that Balor did not catch them at it.
‘We'll leave arrangements of stones,’ suggested Floy, and Snodgrass had said that he believed this had been done on Earth.
‘But many many centuries before the Devastation,’ he said.
‘There was something about a Bronze Age, I believe.
It's a good idea, Floy.’
Floy had said they would do their best, but Fenella and Caspar ought not to rely on it too much.
‘Because although we'll try to outwit Balor, we might have him with us for a goodish while,’ he said.
It was strange to Fenella to know that presently the night would begin to die and that the pale grey and pink streaks of the new day would start to lighten the sky as it had done on Renascia before the Star Maps changed and the Dark Lodestar had sent out its hungry beckoning.
She had always rather liked the very early morning, which had been a little like the liking of a curtain, a thin silver veil, spangled with droplets of moisture.
It was one of the things that had disappeared from Renascia towards the end and it gave Fenella an odd, rather out-of-balance feeling to see dawn light again.
As the sky lightened even more and they began to make out their surroundings more clearly, Fenella and Caspar both found themselves looking out for the signs that Floy had hoped to leave.
‘Stones arranged in heaps,’ said Fenella, frowning, reining her horse in to a slow walk.
‘Boulders.
What they call cairns in the north,’ said Caspar.
‘But very tiny ones.
And they were going to put them in the shape of an arrowhead.
That's if they could put them there.’
‘Floy would have found a way,’ said Fenella firmly.
‘He knew we were going to be following him.’
‘What about Balor?’
‘Oh, he'd have got rid of Balor by now,’ said Fenella.
And then, ‘Wouldn't he?’
‘I hope so,’ said Caspar, gloomily.
As the road lengthened and the sky began to lighten overhead, they were able to see their surroundings more clearly.
Fenella shivered and drew her cloak more tightly about her.
There was a dead, barren feeling to the road now; the trees were becoming sparse and most of them were stunted and twisted.
The grass was shrivelled and blackened and the leafless branches stood out against the grey morning and seemed to reach skeletal fingers towards them.
There were great rocks on the road and thin mist seemed to cling to everywhere.
And it was growing very cold.
Fenella shivered and drew her cloak more closely about her.
There was a dry, raw whiteness to the sky and when, at last, Caspar stopped to consult the maps and discuss with Fenella which road they should take, his breath formed a vapour on the air.
‘Because,’ he said, ‘there aren't any signs from Floy or, if there are, we've missed them.’
‘I don't think we've missed them,’ said Fenella.
‘I think that either Floy couldn't leave them for some reason, or —’
‘Yes?’
‘Or we're lost,’ said Fenella, rather crossly.
‘Let's trace our route on the maps,’ said Caspar, dismounting and tethering his horse to the low branch of a leafless Tree.
‘It ought to be easy enough.’
Fenella slithered down from the horse's back and stood for a moment in the road, feeling the fingers of mist swirl into her face and touch her skin with damp clammy hands.
It was rather a horrid mist; you felt as if it might be concealing peering, grinning creatures who were being very careful to stay just out of sight, but who were creeping after you as you rode along, or who were tiptoeing on ahead of you, rubbing their hands together, waiting until you reached them…
Perhaps the Gruagach had been following them, keeping just out of sight, waiting until they dismounted, ready to reach out and scoop them up and carry them back to Tara and the roasting spits…
I had better stop this, said Fenella to herself very firmly.
I had better remember that there's nothing in the least bit sinister about mists and fogs.
And we should most certainly have heard the Gruagach if they had been following us.
She helped Caspar to spread out the map and, together, they traced the road from Tara along the sides of the Wolfwood and down through a couple of tiny villages.
‘We've done that,’ said Caspar, pointing.
‘Yes, there's the villages we rode through,’ said Fenella, frowning.
‘And that's the fork in the road where you said left and I said right.’
‘Which was it?’
‘Well, it was right, actually,’ said Fenella.
‘We consulted the maps to be sure.’
‘Oh, yes.’
‘We haven't got lost at all,’ said Fenella, who had been secretly rather afraid of this.
‘We're on the right road.’
‘Oh, yes.
It's just that it would have been nice to have seen the signs,’ said Caspar, rolling the maps up and packing them in his saddle bag.
He did not say that he hoped Floy and Snodgrass were all right, because he did not think he had to say it.
Fenella would be thinking it without anybody to suggest it to her.
Fenella was thinking it, but she was trying to be sensible and practical.
It was important to remember that it was only a few hours since Floy and Snodgrass had left Tara, the Shining Citadel, the Bright Palace, and that there was not very much that could have gone wrong for them in those few hours.
We'll be with them in the Fire Court by nightfall.
Or if not tonight, certainly tomorrow.
I'll believe that we will, thought Fenella, firmly.
I'll believe that we'll catch up with them; probably quite soon.
I wish this mist would lift.
Riding on again, down the road which they thought would be the  easiest route to the Fire Court, Fenella began to have the feeling that the twisty Tree stumps were not Tree stumps at all, but horrid, stunted living things and that malicious ancient eyes looked out from their depths.
So strong was the feeling that several times she thought she caught the tail-end of a movement as they passed by several blackened stumps and she turned sharply, expecting to see something leering evilly at them, but there was nothing.
‘And,’ said Caspar, ‘there is a heavy feeling to the air now, can you tell that?’
‘Yes,’ said Fenella in rather a small voice.
‘It's quite difficult to breathe.’
And then, because it would not help to show fear, ‘What would it be?’ she asked and was pleased to hear her voice quite ordinary and sensible.
‘It might be a number of things,’ said Caspar, who was looking about him.
‘But what I think it is, is the Robemaker.’
‘Here?’
Fenella shivered again, but at the corners of her mind, something said: Nuadu!
By finding the Robemaker (or being found by him?) they might somehow rescue Nuadu.
‘I think we are nearing the Robemaker's Workshops,’ said Caspar.
He reined in his horse and made a gesture with one hand that took in the flat dead wasteland and the strangled trees and the black barrenness.
‘Necromancy,’ he said, lowering his voice, ‘Do you know, I never believed in that hoary old tale about necromancy sucking all the goodness and all the warmth from everything, but perhaps I've been wrong.
You'd certainly say the heart has gone from the land hereabouts, wouldn't you?’
‘Yes,’ whispered Fenella, and wished that Caspar had not used the word sucking , because it made you think about coldly evil creatures with grisly appetites, who might leap on to you and cling to you and sink teeth and claws and needle-sharp pincers into you and suck out your blood and your marrow and all your life juices…
‘What ought we to do?’ said Fenella, a bit more loudly than she had meant.
‘We can't turn back.
Can we?’
Because if we turn back, said her mind, then you will be going away from Nuadu, you will be losing what might be the only chance of rescuing him from the Robemaker.
Caspar had said that no one ever escaped from the Robemaker — but I shall not believe that, thought Fenella.
I will not.
If she half closed her eyes, she could still see Nuadu, the thin, rather sardonic smile twisting his lips, his eyes narrowed and mocking.
And there had been that brief time in the Wolfwood — I won't remember it! thought Fenella, but she did remember it.
The mockery fled, the Wolfprince suddenly and disarmingly vulnerable…
Had he loved her at all?
Perhaps just a little.
I'll believe he loved me just a little at least, thought Fenella, sitting quite still on her horse and looking about her.
I'll believe it and I'll believe we can rescue him and then perhaps I shall manage.
It was important to believe, and it was important not to give up.
The early Earth-people had not given up on anything; they had conquered and explored and invented and they had made a marvellous and memorable world.
Caspar was slowing down, his eyes on a dip towards their left, where  the road seemed to fall away into a natural valley.
‘What is it?’ said Fenella.
Caspar said, in a rather flat voice, ‘At least we can be sure of being on the right road.’
‘How can you —’ Then Fenella stopped as well, because the maps had been very explicit.
They had listed all of the places they would have to pass on their way to the Fire Court; they had shown the tiny villages and the Wolfwood and the forks in the road and the long flat road down to Reflection's country and the glittering decadent Fire Court.
They had shown the cluster of dark low-roofed buildings huddled together at the road's side, reaching far back into the hillside.
The Robemaker's dark and evil Workshops.
And they were directly in their path.
To begin with, Nuadu had not found the crimson mask particularly punishing.
The rope-lights were tight-fitting, but they were not cruel; he could breathe easily and he could move.
He did not waste any energy in trying to break free of the mask, because he knew it to be pointless; the Robemaker's dark enchantments were seldom broken and he knew, as well, that there would be far worse torments ahead.
After the winged Soul Eater had gone from the low-ceilinged Workshops, its leathery wings beating on the night, the soul of the mutilated boy held in a merciless grip between its claws, the slaves had scuttled back to their tasks and the Robemaker had conjured up another of the thin, whiplike lights that had lashed out and thrown Nuadu to the floor.
‘Hurry, Wolfprince, for my work does not wait for such as you,’ he said in his sibilant whisper, but now Nuadu detected a lick of pleasure in the voice.
He moved at once, for he would not lie here on the floor before this ancient evil creature and, although it was awkward and painful to stand up because of the ropes that bound his arms, he did so in a swift fluid movement and stood eyeing the Robemaker.
For a moment, the Robemaker did not speak and then he drew nearer, the dark, silken folds of his cloak brushing the floor with a hissing sound.
Nuadu had the sudden impression that, everywhere it touched, the robe left a thick slimy trail; faintly phosphorescent, certainly foul.
A snail's trail.
A slug's trail.
An emission of pure evil.
And this is the creature who is draining Ireland's heart away and this is the creature who holds sway over Tara, he thought.
But he stayed where he was and he continued to regard the Robemaker from over the restricting mask and, presently, the Robemaker said, ‘Does it not irk you and chafe you to be so confined, Wolfprince?’
For the first time, Nuadu caught the briefest hint of discomposure from the necromancer and knew that by remaining calm and apparently indifferent he had succeeded in disconcerting the Robemaker a little.
But the moment passed and the Robemaker had folded his arms, the deep sleeves hanging down.
Nuadu saw that his hands were hidden by dark gloves, but that they were thin and hard-looking.
Emaciated.
What was behind the dark robe and what was within the deep, all-concealing hood?
The Robemaker turned his head and Nuadu felt a sudden white piercing pain deep inside his mind and he knew at once that the Robemaker had made use of the ancient, forbidden Stroicim Inchinn again and that he had pierced into his secret thoughts.
He felt a sudden unwilling awe for this creature who could with such ease summon and bend to his will the terrible Stroicim Inchinn .
‘The paths of your mind are mine to walk if I wish it,’ said the Robemaker.
‘You find that alarming, I think?
Yes, for amongst your own puny sorcerers, there is a code of honour.’
The words came out on a sneer.
‘A code that forbids the Stroicim Inchinn .’
Again the dark hood moved and Nuadu caught the glint of dark, malevolent eyes.
‘I have only contempt and hatred for your sorcerers, Wolfprince,’ said the Robemaker, and again Nuadu had the sense that the Robemaker was gauging his reactions.
He fixed his eyes on the cloaked figure and waited.
‘Your sorcerers cast me out,’ said the Robemaker.
‘Did you know that, Wolfprince?
Did you know that they exiled me —me !
I was the greatest of the spell weavers and I was the most powerful enchanter they had ever known.’
He stopped, breathing harshly, and, within the hood, his head seemed to tilt slyly.
‘I was once at Tara, Wolfprince’ said the Robemaker in his soft insinuating voice.
‘Does that surprise you?
Once I served the High King Erin — oh, long since.
Decades and centuries.’
He made an abrupt gesture, indicating the enveloping cloak, the deep, hanging sleeves.
‘Your ancestors were gracious to their servants, Nuadu of the Silver Arm,’ he said, sneeringly.
‘They were generous.’
He paused, and Nuadu felt the black hatred emanating from him again.
‘I brought immense powers to Tara in those days,’ said the Robemaker after a moment.
‘I sought to increase my powers, for to master the ancient art of sorcery,truly to master it, it is necessary to master all else.
It is necessary to understand and master every pleasure and every pain, every cruelty and every kindness.’
He stopped again, and Nuadu waited.
‘I had mastered the pleasures and the kindnesses,’ said the Robemaker.
‘But it was still necessary to master their counterparts.’
The half-hidden eyes gleamed.
‘It was necessary to explore, to the utmost, pain and cruelty and the dark secret yearning of men's souls,’ he said.
‘And so I did what few dare to do, Wolfprince.
I went through one of the gateways that exist between this Ireland and the Dark Ireland, that other Realm, that mirror-image which is no mirror-image at all, but a land in its own right.
The underside of the Wolfkings’ Ireland, Nuadu of the Silver Arm; the place where the necromancers and the dark Fields of Sorcery lie, where the Black Citadels of the powerful enchanters exist deep in the desolate Mountains of Twilight.’
He stopped again and Nuadu, trying to guard his thoughts, certainly trying to shield his eyes, thought: and once in the Dark Ireland, you were lured to the side of the necromancers!
You were enticed by the dark magicians into their palaces and their dark citadels and you were shown the powers and the sinisterly beautiful rewards of sorcery.
It would not be the first time that a Court sorcerer had been lured away from the strong pure magic of Ireland and sworn allegiance to the Dark Realm.
He remembered the ancient and persistent belief that once any living creature has walked in the Black Fields of Sorcery and dined at the tables of the Lords of the Dark Ireland, he is for ever lost to the true Ireland.
For a terrible moment, something flared in his heart and he felt an insidious tug at his mind:how would it be to enter that Realm, and talk with the Dark Lords and learn their secrets…?
How would it be to walk in the Dark Fields and journey in the Mountains of Twilight and swim in the underground Crimson Lakes …?
And then his mind cleared, and he was looking at the Robemaker and feeling contempt for him again, feeling as well, the dangerous, powerful white spears of the Stroicim Inchinn withdraw, so that he knew the Robemaker had again called up the Stroicim without giving any outward indication of having done so.
Nuadu thought that a glitter of amusement showed from within the folds of the hood.
When the Robemaker spoke again in his soft hissing voice, he knew he had been right.
‘You see, Nuadu Airgetlam?’ said the Robemaker.
‘You see how easily I can influence your mind?
You see how effortlessly I can conjure up the visions and tempt you into that Realm where I, too, am a Prince?’
He turned about abruptly, as if the subject was suddenly painful or an irritation.
‘It was the High King Erin who ruled in those days,’ he said.
‘And he it was who summoned the Court sorcerers to drive me out.
It was those clever, smug Royal sorcerers, who wove the spell of punishment.’
A brief glitter of triumph showed deep within the hood.
‘But they were unable to chain me with their own powers,’ he said, softly.
‘They could not yoke me.
And so they had to harness my own power — mine!
They had to tap the source of my strength and turn it against me, until it formed a carapace, a cage that held me until they were ready to pronounce punishment.’
He turned about, the silken skirts of his robe hissing across the floor's surface.
‘I was caged by my own power,’ he said in his soft, malevolent voice.
‘I was imprisoned and held captive by the very forces I had so long sought to perfect and that I had honed and polished until they were stronger and more glittering than anything ever known at Tara.
He came back to stand directly in front of Nuadu.
‘But it was the High King Erin who pronounced the spell,’ he said and the cold bitterness was in his voice again.
‘He it was who stood in the deepest Sorcery Chamber of tara and read from the Book of the Academy of Necromancers the incantation.
For that,’ said the Robemaker, viciously, ‘I am sworn to inflict every curse and every torment I may summon on his House.
That is why I joined with the Master CuRoi in his quest to possess Ireland.
That is why I stooped to traffic with the Man-greedy Frost Giantess, and why I intrigued with her to drive out the Gruagach and why I helped the Gruagach to vanquish the High King and take Tara.’
A rather terrible bubble of mirth broke from him.
‘The Gruagach did not suspect,’ said the Robemaker.
‘Never once, during our association, did they guess that I was using them to further my revenge against the  Wolfkings.
But the Wolfkings have been exiled and, although the Gruagach are at Tara, it is I who truly rule.
That was always my intention.
It is still my intention.’
He paused, and appeared to study Nuadu.
‘It is why you are here, Wolfprince.
Your half-brother lies deep inside the Dark Realm and, unless he is rescued, you are Tara's heir.
You are a bastard, but you possess the Royal blood and also the Wolfblood.
If you called to the people, they would follow you because of that.’
Deep within the concealing hood, there was a gleam of pure hatred.
‘You are the heir presumptive,’ hissed the Robemaker, ‘and as such you must be quenched and crushed.
‘I shall put you to the treadmills, Nuadu of the Silver Arm, and I shall enjoy seeing you suffer.
I shall enjoy seeing you suffer as I have suffered.’
With an abrupt gesture, the dark, bony, black-clad hands came up and the hood was thrust back.
The flickering light from the furnaces fell across his exposed face.
‘You see?’ cried the Robemaker harshly.
‘You see what it was that the High King Erin pronounced over me!
You see the curse I bear, Wolfprince!
‘Erin pronounced on me the Draoicht Tinneas Siorai .
‘The Enchantment of Eternal Disease.’
Nuadu was glad that he was unable to speak, for to have done so, to have uttered any kind of sound, would certainly have been to betray the utter revulsion that engulfed him.
He thought he made some kind of strangled gasp; he knew his eyes would have expressed his emotions.
He found himself hovering for a dangerous moment between pity and fear and he fought down the pity at once, for it was not to be thought of that he should feel such an emotion for this evil being.
But as he stood facing the Robemaker in the low-ceilinged workroom, the humming of the Silver Looms all about them, the dry heat stifling and the air thick with the red glow of the furnaces, he looked fully into the face of his captor and thought: what did he do to Ireland's Royal House to deserve such punishment?
Seen without the concealing hood, the Robemaker's face was mutilated and eaten away, so that here and there white bone gleamed.
But even the bone itself is eaten away in places, thought Nuadu, sick with horror.
The Robemaker's skin was covered with suppurating sores, great festering, oozing ulcers, leprous growths, cancerous chancres.
In places, the bone was exposed and, in the uncertain light, Nuadu could nearly believe that it had been nibbled.
Yes, Wolfprince, nibbled, gnawed, ravaged by the bone-eating curse of Erin's sorcerers…
The Draoicht Tinneas Siorai…
There was a lipless mouth, their were deep eye sockets from which gleamed the small evil,old eyes of the necromancer.
Nuadu could see that even the pale, jellied part of one eye was partly missing and he had the sudden sickening impression that it had been eaten away from within .
At the centre of the face was a concave portion and Nuadu knew that the jutting bone of the nose had gone.
There were two cavernous  nostrils and Nuadu realised that this was the reason for the hissing whispering voice.
The malevolent smile liked the terrible mouth again.
‘You see?’ said the Robemaker.
‘You see how the Wolfkings reward those who dare to go against them?’
With a swift, savage gesture, he tore off the dark gloves.
‘You see?’ he said, thrusting skeletal hands forward and Nuadu flinched, for the hands were as ravaged and as eaten as the Robemaker's face; the nails hung by shreds, and the remaining skin was matted and crusted.
‘One of the most malicious and vicious curses of the Amaranth sorcerers of tara,’ said the Robemaker and pulled the hood back into place, so that it was once again the forbidding cloaked being who stood there.
‘I have worked for many centuries to lift it, Nuadu, but it is a long hard task, for the punishment was to be eternal.’
He stopped, and Nuadu waited, ‘At last I bargained with the Soul Eaters,’ said the Robemaker softly.
‘I bargained with them to regain my body and my powers.
I traded with them so that the young girls of the country would no longer shrink from me in revulsion,’ he said, and there was a lick of sensuality in the hissing voice now.
‘For,’ said the Robemaker, softly and slyly, ‘if the Geimhreadh has the voracious appetites of all her race and seeks to suck dry every man who comes into her power, then I have the carnal appetites of Men.’
His eyes gleamed redly again.
‘The Gruagach think to buy the daughter of Reflection and Fael-Inis for their King,’ he said.
‘But it is I who will have that one!
I will embrace her and caress her and possess her.’
Lust glowed redly in his terrible face, and then faded.
‘The Soul Eaters know me well by now,’ he said.
‘For I have gone many times to the Cavern of Cruachan.
I have many times entered into the place that is called, and rightly, the Gateway to Hell.
‘I have taken souls to my Masters, Wolfprince, and every one I give them is placed on the Silver Scales of Justice.’
He looked up as Nuadu made a quick movement and Nuadu caught again the amusement.
‘Yes, Wolfprince,’ said the Robemaker in his soft diseased voice.
‘Yes, those Scales that the faithful foolish Gnomes of Gallan wrought for Erin and which disappeared towards the end of his reign.’
He moved closer to Nuadu and Nuadu caught the stench of diseased flesh.
‘The Soul Eaters took them,’ said the Robemaker.
‘Just as they will take everything of any value in Ireland.
The Scales are in the Cruachan Caves, in the Court of the Soul Eaters, and every soul I offer up is placed on the Scales.
And every time that happens, the Scales weigh a little more heavily in my favour.’
He was standing looking down on Nuadu now, the dark, silken cloak swirling.
‘Soon the Scales will tip in my favour,’ he said.
‘Soon I shall have given enough souls to my Masters.
It is then that I shall be restored.’
The Robemaker laughed, and the sound made Nuadu's skin prickle with horror, for it was a sickening bone-against-bone sound.
Lipless mouth…noseless face.
And then:he has rendered up countless souls to the creatures of the Cruachan Caves , thought Nuadu.
Why, then, has he not been released ?
The white shafts of the Stroicim Inchinn darted again and Nuadu felt the piercing brilliance.
‘You are very innocent, Wolfprince,’ said the Robemaker.
‘There is one soul I must still take and give to my Masters.’
And then, as Nuadu tilted his head, waiting, ‘The soul of Ireland's High King,’ said the Robemaker, and again the fleshless chuckle bubbled from him.
‘But you know already that he is held within the Dark Ireland and that he is captive in a deep and subtle enchantment.
You have long since suspected what happened to your half-brother after the Gruagach stormed Tara and killed the King.’
He leaned even nearer and Nuadu stood his ground and managed to withstand the stench of the suppurating flesh and the rotting bones.
‘We fought over him, Nuadu Airgetlam,’ said the Robemaker, and there was a slick lascivious tone to his voice now.
‘The Dark Lords fought over who should have the chaining of him.’
A frown touched his eyes for a moment.
‘And because there are those whose powers are yet greater than mine, I lost him,’ he said.
‘He is held in thrall to the Dark Ireland, but it was not my enchantment that chained him.’
He stared at Nuadu, and Nuadu stared back, and thought: CuRoi!
So CuRoi does have him!
The Robemaker said, ‘I shall reach him, of course.
I shall reach him and when I have done that I shall break him.’
He studied Nuadu for a moment.
‘I shall break him,’ he said.
‘If it takes me seven centuries, I shall do it.’
There was the white gleam of bone as he smiled.
‘I shall give him to the Geimhreadh to play with for a few nights,’ he said.
‘Perhaps I shall watch while she drinks her fill of his manhood and sucks him dry of his accursed wolfseed.
She and I are long since sworn one to aid the other,’ said the Robemaker.
‘And there is much pleasure in watching a virile young creature brought to impotency.’
The lipless mouth leered.
‘Have you never heard of the Geimhreadh's pincer hands that hold her victim's phallus in place and have you never heard of her darting pronged tongue that licks and pierces into the shaft of her victim's phallus?’ said the Robemaker, softly and insinuatingly.
‘Then you, also, must be given that pleasure, for I should not care for you to miss an instant of any pain, Wolfprince.’
He leaned closer and Nuadu regarded him unflinchingly.
‘I shall break you as well, Nuadu of the Silver Arm’ said the Robemaker.
‘You may defy me now, but you will not continue to do so.
Even though I have chained and muzzled you for the wolf you are, still your eyes challenge and your mind defies.’
The lipless mouth smiled again.
‘I shall put you to the treadmills,’ said the Robemaker.
‘I shall make use of you and you will work alongside my slaves here.
You will work until your feet are stripped raw of flesh and until your legs are bowed and your skin is shrivelled.
Only then, Wolfprince, only when you are cowed and submissive, only when I have drawn from you every shred of defiance, when I have extracted every sliver of pleasure I can from your predicament, shall I take your soul.
‘And when you and your royal half-brother have been sucked dry of every drop of accursed wolfseed by the Frost Giantess; when you have been deprived of every drop that might bear fruit in some unknown womb and create another wolfcreatury, I shall give you both to the Soul Eaters.
‘With those two souls placed on the Scales of Sorcery and rendered to the Soul Eaters, my debt will have been paid.
‘My powers will be restored — and I shall rule Ireland for ever.’
Chapter Twenty-four
Floy and Snodgrass had stopped to rest on the outskirts of the Wolfwood.
Floy thought he would have rather enjoyed this journey if it had not been for the nagging concern about Fenella, left behind in the giants' hands.
He would have enjoyed seeing more of this blue and green misty world with the lingering scents of ancient magic everywhere and he would have liked to see some of its people and found out how they lived and what they did and if they were happy.
But the few houses they passed seemed to have their doors locked and bolted and their windows shuttered.
Floy looked with interest at the fields and pastures and thought that, although they were much larger than the ones on Renascia and the crops and vegetables were not quite the same, there was not so very much difference, really.
But they were untended.
They were deserted and desolated and there was a terrible, bleak air of neglect everywhere.
Floy remembered what Nuadu Airgetlam had said about the Robemaker taking sacrifice from the ordinary Irish people and putting the sons to work in the Dark Workshops and guessed that the people had simply lost heart.
How must it be to tend your bit of land and sow crops and vegetables and perhaps rear animals, knowing you were building up a comfortable home and an inheritance for your children and then see your children taken and forced into slavery by the Robemaker?
As they rode farther along the road, Floy glimpsed the occasional peering face at a cottage window and guessed that the sounds of their horses on the highroad and perhaps the sight of Balor's huge menacing figure, had sent them all scuttling indoors for safety.
This was a truly dreadful way for people to live.
Plainly they went in constant fear of the Robemaker and the Dark Realm.
Clearly all the heart was going not only from the land, but from the people as well.
He began to feel extremely glad that they had agreed to help the exiled Court.
He thought they had unquestionably been right to believe Nuadu and Tealtaoich and the others.
With Balor loping along at their side, they could not discuss whether Fenella would be all right, or speculate how soon she and Caspar would catch them up, or even try to spy out a place to stop and wait for them.
Several times Floy cast sidelong looks at Balor, trying to decide how percipient he might be, but Balor simply turned his head and grinned the gap-toothed grin and occasionally nodded amiably.
Once he hummed a snatch of song, which was something about hunting Humans for the Fidchell and about turning  them on spits and serving them up as Manpie.
But although he might not be bright, Balor's head was on a level with Floy and Snodgrass as they sat astride the two horses and he was twice the size of either of them.
He would very easily subdue them if they attempted to escape.
He would certainly notice if they tried to leave signs for Fenella and Caspar to follow.
The Wolfwood was as dark and as secretive as it had been when they journeyed through to the Forest Court with Nuadu, but here and there, deep within the Trees, Floy caught the darting movement of green and gold; the rustling of silver-tipped leaves that looked, for a moment, like the trailing hair of a creature almost Human…
He touched Snodgrass's arm and nodded in the direction of the forest and Snodgrass said, very softly, ‘The Trees.
Miach's spell,’ and Floy thought: so, after all, he woke them.
He wondered whether they would see the Tree Spirits and then he wondered whether they wanted to see them.
They had sounded rather fearsome beings.
‘Puny things, Trees,’ Balor said.
‘Chop 'em down and use 'em for firewood, I say.’
He dealt a nearby Tree a rather contemptuous blow with the flat of his hand and Floy saw the Tree trunk quiver under the impact.
‘And now a bite to eat,’ said Balor, grinning the wide, flat grin of all the Gruagach.
‘A bite to eat and then we'll be getting along again.’
There was nothing for it but to do as he suggested.
As they dismounted it crossed Floy's mind that the longer they could delay, the better chance Fenella and Caspar had of catching them up.
In the same moment, he realised that it would be extremely dangerous for Fenella to join them.
Balor would at once know that they had outwitted Inchbad and Goibniu.
They walked a little way into the Trees, where it would be more comfortable to sit on the thick, dry forest floor and eat their food and rest.
Dusk was beginning to touch the forest and deep shadows lay across the small clearing where they sat down.
Balor leaned back against the nearest Tree and Snodgrass unpacked the food and spread it out.
‘A good spread,’ said Balor, his small eyes lighting.
‘I like a good spread.’
He reached for a half loaf of bread with both hands and said, by the six hairs of his grandmother's beard, they were doing very well out of all this.
‘And it's a fine day for a journey,’ he said.
Floy was still turning over in his mind ideas and schemes for getting rid of Balor.
It was extremely difficult to know what to do with a giant who loped along at your side and who could reach out and pluck you from your horse's back with one hand.
Floy thought that, even if they broke into a gallop (which he was not at all sure about doing), Balor would simply increase his own pace and catch them very easily.
Floy and Snodgrass ate the food without noticing it very much, but Balor snatched great handfuls from the pack and crammed them into his mouth, spraying crumbs everywhere, letting grease dribble down his chin.
‘Pork,’ he said, nodding.
‘Roast pig.
Very nice.’
And then, with a sudden cackle, ‘But not as nice as roast Human.
By the whiskery snout  of the gods, it's nowhere near as good.
But I see there's blood sausage,’ he said, and sent them such a terrible leery grin, that Snodgrass, who had been cutting himself a slice from this, which he had innocently thought was something like the spicy Renascian liver-and-wine-roll, recoiled and snatched his hand back as if he had been burnt.
Balor grinned at Snodgrass and smacked his lips and grabbed the cask of mead and thought that hadn't the Humans strange, mimsing appetites to be sure.
There was nothing so fine as a good meaty portion of best blood sausage.
Floy had been surreptitiously trying to gather up stones which they could arrange at the roadside, perhaps in the form of an arrow for Fenella and Caspar.
But, even as he did so, he knew that such a small sign would almost certainly be missed.
They needed to leave something noticeable, something that could easily be seen and not misunderstood.
And anything noticeable by Caspar and Fenella would also be noticed by Balor.
Balor had unbuttoned his jerkin and brushed the crumbs from his front and was preparing to take a snooze.
He was rather liking this bit of a jaunt, although he had not been very enthusiastic when Goibniu had ordered him to set out.
Accompany a brace of Humans on a journey and not touch hide nor hair nor whisker of either of them! he had said.
There was a thing to make a decent Human-eating giant shiver in his boots and think shame!
Could he not deliver just one of them, he had asked, looking at Goibniu slyly from the corners of his eyes.
But Goibniu had said no, both the Humans must be taken to the Fire Court and Balor must go along with them and, after they had talked with Reflection, Balor must bring them safely back to Tara.
He dropped into a bit of a snooze, which any giant might be pardoned for wanting after so much walking and a bit of eating, never mind a sup of mead.
The Humans were sitting a little way off; Balor would hear them if they tried to get away.
He would be up and after them in the blink of an eye.
As Balor's eyelids closed and snores emitted from his mouth, Floy and Snodgrass exchanged looks.
Dare they try to steal away now?
Floy got up, not furtively, but quite openly and naturally, so that if Balor should open his eyes it would not seem as if Floy had been trying to run away.
It was an eerie feeling to be stealing through the forest like this.
Floy began to have the sensation that he was being watched, not by Balor or Snodgrass, but by other creatures, creatures who lived in this huge, dark forest, and crept out only under cover of darkness…
He glanced back over his shoulder but Balor was still sleeping.
If I can just reach the horses, thought Floy, moving stealthily forwards.
If I can just reach the horses and reach up and untether them, I believe we could be off and down the road and the creature would never catch up with us.
He was strongly aware of the Wolfwood all about him as he walked cautiously under the Trees.
There was a stirring, a sense that at any minute the branches over his head might dip over him and brush his  face, or that the roots that had thrust up out of the earth might wriggle and become alive and twine themselves about his feet.
Several times he stopped and listened, thinking that there had been a movement just behind him or just to the side of him, or that something had padded after him on stealthy feet and was standing watching him.
But each time there was nothing and Floy thought that perhaps, after all, it was simply the half-light of the Wolfwood and the ordinary scurryings of the night creatures.
He remembered that they had forgotten about dusk and about twilight on Renascia and about the strange tricks that the shadows could play.
The light was fading perceptibly now; they had set out in the full glare of the midday sun, but they had ridden for several hours and dusk was creeping across the land.
The Purple Hour, thought Floy, fascinated and a bit fearful.
What had Nuadu said?
The hour when magic is abroad .
I refused to believe it then, he thought, but I believe it now.
Magic, stealing through the ancient forest, lying thickly on the air…
The Trees had thinned out now and he could see the road ahead of him.
Could it be this easy?
Could they simply creep away from Balor and ride out of his reach?
The stirrings and the rustlings were louder and Floy was suddenly and strongly aware of eyes upon him.
He turned sharply, looking back to where the sleeping Balor lay.
Snodgrass was nearby, sitting bolt upright, watching Floy anxiously.
There was a movement within the Trees, the sudden shifting of green and gold and russet, so that Floy knew the dusk had not been playing tricks after all.
There were beings, creatures, strange inHuman presences everywhere in the forest.
He stood, looking, and there was the movement again; the blurring of shapes and silhouettes that were like nothing Floy had ever imagined; inHuman and ancient and filled with wild woodland enchantment…
The Tree Spirits of the ancient Wolfwood were awake and they were creeping through the darkening forest towards them.
Chapter Twenty-five
Balor had never been so rudely awoken from slumber in his life.
At one minute it seemed that he had been having a fine old dream about Humans and banquets and the Frost Giantess frying on a spit.
The next he had been jerked fully awake and found himself at the centre of a circle of strange, hostile creatures, the like of which he had never seen in his life.
It seemed to his slow, sleep-sodden mind, that there were hundreds of the horrid things and that they were all bearing down on him, a rushing curtain of green and gold and brown, with here and there wild, menacing eyes and reaching, clutching hands that were not hands at all, but nasty, skeletal twigs.
He stumbled to his feet and looked frantically about him, because although no self-respecting Gruagach would run from a danger, these creatures were too many and too huge and too angry .
He scrabbled into a half run, going deeper into the Wolfwood, not looking where he was going, not caring overmuch.
He would outrun the horrid things who had stood leering at him, because there was never a being yet created that could catch a Gruagach once he put his mind to running.
By the seven beards of his ancestors, Balor would run, and they'd see who could run faster!
It certainly would not be the sinister Treelike beings who had regarded him with such terrible vengeance in their unnatural faces!
Floy and Snodgrass stared at one another and then Floy said, ‘We'll have to follow them.’
‘Why?
Isn't this the exact chance to escape?’ said Snodgrass.
‘No,’ said Floy.
‘Because supposing they don't catch him and supposing he does escape —’
‘If he came back and found we'd made off by ourselves, he'd go back to Tara and tell them we'd reneged on the bargain,’ finished Snodgrass.
‘And Fenella would be at the mercy of Goibniu and the rest.
Yes.
That's why we'll have to see what happens,’ said Floy.
‘Hurry, and we'll catch up with them!’
They broke into a run, seeing the Tree Spirits directly ahead of them; a pouring, changing, blurring mass of russet and green; a sweep of autumn tapestry, moving and reaching and sweeping through the forest after the giant.
But he won't get far,’ cried Floy, managing to keep the Tree Spirits in sight.
‘He won't get far, because this is their territory!
They have him in their own country!
Come on, Snodgrass!
We mustn't lose them!’
They were going deeper into the green and blue heart of the  Wolfwood and Floy felt his lungs beginning to ache and his chest pound.
At his side, Snodgrass was capering along, occasionally leaping nimbly over a patch of undergrowth, one hand holding his hat on his head, his cloak flying about his ankles, but keeping pace with Floy.
‘He's fallen!’ cried Floy, and they slowed to a walk, gasping and trying to get their breath.
‘But you're fitter than you look,’ said Floy, with a sudden grin at Snodgrass.
‘A touch dishevelled, of course,’ rejoined Snodgrass, who was puffing a bit .
He righted his spectacles which had been knocked askew and straightened his cloak.
Ahead of them, Balor was lying on the ground and they saw that the Tree Spirits had grouped themselves about him, rather in the manner of people arranging themselves to watch some entertainment, or hear some kind of cause being pleaded.
‘He didn't get so far at that,’ said Snodgrass, as they stood rather warily on the outskirts of the group.
Floy glanced over his shoulder, trying to gauge how far they had come and in which direction the road now lay.
The light had almost gone from the day now and the forest was becoming bathed in soft, subtle hues of the Purple Hour, Dark blue and turquoise light slanted in through the trees, turning the Wolfwood to a place of dark secret shadows and heavy ancient magic.
Balor had fallen headlong and was lying on the forest floor, one foot caught and held by the root of a huge old ash Tree that protruded from the ground.
The wild golden eyes and the pitiless faces of the naiads and dryads and hamadryads loomed over him, hands that were not hands but branches, reaching for him, pinioning him down.
The Tree Spirits were wild and beautiful, but rather terrible.
Closer to them, it was possible to make out individual characteristics; to see that they had trailing leaves instead of hair and huge, reaching branches instead of arms.
They looked what they were: creatures, Spirits of Trees, that had emerged from the ancient Wolfwood from a long, long sleep and who were alive and alert and completely without pity towards their enemies…
Floy and Snodgrass stayed where they were, standing quietly, watching from the edges of the clearing.
Floy thought they probably ought to be afraid themselves, because the Tree Spirits were so inHuman and so wild and so clearly filled with strange woodland magic that once they had finished with Balor they might very well turn to the two Renascians.
‘Ought we to try to get away?’ whispered Snodgrass, whose mind had been going along similar paths.
‘I think it's all right,’ responded Floy, warily, but even as he spoke he was wondering whether it was all right , and whether they mightn't be better simply to walk back through the forest and on to the road.
And then he thought: I suppose we shall find the road again, shall we?
The Trees had surrounded Balor; a towering wall of reaching branches and immense trunks and snaking roots, veined with the golden threads of the Beeches and the glossy green Oaks and with the  shimmering, silver rivers of the Birches.
To Floy, they were beautiful and rather frightening and immensely powerful.
Their eyes were ancient, filled with the wisdom of their long lives, and their shapes were not quite Tree and not quite Human, but a blend of the two.
If you looked at the Trees' upper halves; at the streaming leaf-hair and the mischievous faces of the Silver Birches and the wise, implacable solemnity of the Oaks and the cool, wanton beauty of the Beeches, you could very nearly see similarities to Human features and Human characteristics.
The Tree Spirits' bodies did not thicken in the way that the Trees, their homes, thickened, except for the Oaks who had sturdy, rather shapeless trunks.
They had graceful, slender bodies, tapering into root-like shapes where a Human would have ankles and feet.
To Floy, these strange, rootish feet were the most alien feature of all.
‘And they are fibrous-looking,’ murmured Floy, half to himself.
‘They are too graceful for claws, but they are very like claws.
They can almost grip the ground as they walk.’
‘They're strong, as well.
They would break a man's neck easily, those roots,’ said Snodgrass.
They would break a man's neck easily, and they would break a giant's back with hardly more effort…
Balor was still clumsily trying to scramble to his feet, but the twining roots held him firmly.
His brutish, stupid face was blotchy with fear now and his eyes were bolting from his head.
He tore at the roots that were pinioning his ankles, breaking his thick horn nails in the process, but the roots held and it seemed to the two watching Renascians, that the Tree Spirits swayed and murmured with amusement.
Balor let out a bellow of fear and, in the same moment, the Trees closed in.
They did it singly and purposefully, as if a silent command had been given.
They surrounded him so completely that, for a few moments, Floy and Snodgrass could not see him.
As they moved, the Trees sent out a wailing, keening cry, splitting the quiet forest.
‘It's a war cry,’ said Snodgrass.
‘Isn't it?
They're angry with him.’
‘For denigrating that oak where he tethered the horses?’
‘Yes.
Yes, that, and the way the Gruagach ignored the — what did Nuadu and Caspar call them?— the Tree Laws,’ said Snodgrass, his eyes intent on what was happening.
‘Don't you remember how, at Tara, they had those huge, roaring fires and how they had baskets and boxes piled high with logs and branches?’
‘Yes,’ said Floy.
‘Yes, of course.
They're being revenged on Balor for it.’
The Trees were all about Balor now and the Wolfwood was ringing with the shrieks of their blood lust.
Their eyes glittered and their branches reached out.
The fearsome, fibrous roots whipped across the grind.
What happened next was rather terrible.
Floy and Snodgrass, unable to look away, were sickened and awed.
‘It's no more than he deserves,’ said Snodgrass.
‘It's no more than any of them deserve.’
‘Oh no,’ said Floy softly, remembering Fenella and the Fidchell board and Caspar's descriptions of how the Gruagach used Humans.
‘No, they deserve no less.’
Even so, it was terrible.
The Trees reached down to Balor with their branches and spread him flat on the ground, unlashing the ground roots that had held him, replacing them with the strong, clutching roots of two of the largest Oaks.
Two more Oaks lashed their roots to his wrists and the Trees watched, critically.
Balor was bellowing for help; he was calling down vengeance on the Trees and promising that Inchbad and the Robemaker and the Master CuRoi would certainly punish the Trees for this.
‘By the hairs of my ancestors’ beards, you'll be cut into collops and burned in the chimneys of tara!’he cried.
The Trees paid him no heed.
They simply continued to secure him, coldly and efficiently, as if this was just something that had to be done and as if there was no particular feeling in doing it.
The largest of the Oaks, who had the high-domed features of a scholar and a thinker, and who had massive powerful shoulders, made a sign and the four Oaks who held Balor captive moved.
‘Away from one another,’ said Floy, in horror.
‘They are all moving in opposite directions.’
‘They're tearing him into four,’ said Snodgrass.
‘Each of the Oaks is pulling on an arm or a leg and pulling outwards .
This is — I suppose we can't do other than let it happen.’
‘I don't see how we can stop them,’ said Floy, his eyes on the circling Tree Spirits and on the four Oaks who were now hauling on their claw-like roots, dragging Balor's limbs outwards away from his body.
Balor was braying in anger and pain.
As the Trees moved, both his arms and legs were jerked into taut, out-flung positions.
The coiled roots bit into his flesh, dragging against the skin, so that blood welled to the surface.
‘But the roots will hold firm,’ said Floy, unable to look away.
Balor was struggling and writhing, but his limbs were held fast and only his thick, shapeless body could move.
It threshed this way and that, as the giant tried, uselessly, to pull free of the Trees' cruel grip.
They moved again, pulling away, but Floy and Snodgrass could see that it was hard work for them.
But they are gaining an inch at a time, thought Floy, in horror; they are stretching muscle and flesh.
The farthest of the Trees made a sudden jerking, twisting movement and Balor's arm wrenched out of its socket and lay flaccid and limp.
As the Trees bent to their grisly task again, there was a terrible cracking, bone-against-muscle sound and Balor screeched, sweat beading on his face and running down into his thick coarse neck.
His eyes bulged from his head, red-veined and ghastly, and his lips were drawn back from his blackened, stump-like teeth, as the full horror of what the Trees were doing impinged on his dull mind.
The watching Trees showed no emotion.
They simply stayed where they where, circled about their prisoner, their faces implacable, their eyes cold.
The four Oaks were still hauling on their prisoner and Floy and  Snodgrass could see that Balor's arms and legs were all wrenched from their sockets now, twisted at awkward, unnatural angles.
Floy felt a lurch of sympathetic pain, because surely to simply dislocate an arm was purest agony, but to have it then pulled and pulled until the skin began to split and bleed, must be the most exquisite agony ever.
The Elms had moved forward in their stolid fashion and were leaning ponderously over the tortured Balor.
As Floy and Snodgrass watched in silence, the Elms stretched out their hard, lichen-crusted branches and brought them down on the prisoner's shoulders and thighs, at the place where the skin had started to tear.
Balor had let out a screech of purest agony, but the Elms bent over him with serious, heavy-featured faces and sawed partly through each of the pinioned limbs.
They did not make any hurry about it and Balor writhed and flailed helplessly and blood began to run out on to the ground beneath him.
‘They're making it easier for the Oaks,’ whispered Floy.
‘The Oaks couldn't quite pull off his arms and legs, so they're helping them.’
‘It's like something from a medieval torture chamber,’ said Snodgrass.
‘We had a woodcut of one.
Terrible things.
They could wrench their prisoners’ arms and legs from the sockets.
But I don't think even they went this far.’
Balor had stopped struggling, but was moaning and panting shallowly.
His face was the colour of tallow and blood and saliva ran down his chin and the two Renascians saw that his lips were bitten to shreds.
‘Dreadful,’ said Snodgrass, shuddering, but Floy said, ‘It is only what the Gruagach have done to the Trees.’
Dark, sluggish blood was running from the wounds made by the Elms and there was the gleam of whitish bone and of raw muscle.
As the Oaks moved again, the wounds yawned and slowly, slowly, inch by terrible inch, they gaped wider and skin began to tear and the muscle and bone began to part with a sound that made Floy and Snodgrass both feel sick.
It was the sound of flesh being rent from bone, and the sound of gristle and fat and marrow being torn apart.
Floy thought, with sick dread, that it was the exact sound made when you twisted a leg of chicken from the carcase.
Balor gave a last bubbling cry and a sudden ripple of triumph went through the Trees as the farthest of the Oaks pulled free an arm and held it aloft, a bloody stump, a torn-off gobbet of flesh.
‘A trophy,’ murmured Snodgrass.
‘Yes.’
The other three Oaks had redoubled their efforts now and, one by one, the rest of the giant's limbs were torn from their moorings and held aloft, wet, bleeding rags of flesh.
The bloodied torso of what had been Balor lay twitching on the ground, moving clumsily, trying to pull itself along the ground, like a monstrous beetle which has been turned on its shelly back and cannot right itself.
Thick, sluggish blood seeped from the great jagged holes where his arms and legs had been and, with them, a watery pus.
A thick, too-sweet stench lay on the air.
As the Trees moved back, silently watching their victim, Balor's  bitten lips emitted a bubbling moan and saliva and blood dribbled out again.
There was a choking rattle and his eyes turned upwards, so that only the whites showed, red-veined and protruding slightly.
‘Dead,’ said Floy softly, and then looked at the Trees.
The Oak, who had seemed earlier on to be the leader, said, ‘Yes, Human creature, he is dead.
It is no more than he has done to our people.’
‘Yes.
I see.’
‘We shall bury him,’ said the Oak, and Moy saw that already the Tree Spirits were scrabbling at the earth, their roots scraping and shovelling, so that, quite soon, a deep trench was opened.
‘Into the earth with the remains,’ said the Oak, turning to watch.
‘Let his rotting carcase mingle with the forest.’
It was rather dreadful to see Balor's remains flung unceremoniously into the trench, first the mutilated torso and then the arms and legs.
‘Meat for our roots,’ said the Oak, and a rather grim smile touched its features.
‘Yes.’
But Floy was still sickened; he remembered how on Renascia they had tried to follow what they had known of the Earth-people's death rituals and how they had had the large, austere Firehouse with the ornate bronze lamps which were always kept burning in memory of those who had died.
The dead were consumed by cleansing fire at a ceremony which every Renascian was bound to attend and there would usually be a carefully arranged display of the dead person's life and a small booklet telling about his life and his work, nearly always written by Snizort and Snodgrass in gentle and tactful collaboration with the bereaved family.
‘We shall eat the giant as its people ate our people,’ said the Oak and regarded Floy and Snodgrass steadily.
‘And as its people eat your people,’ it said.
‘That must not be forgotten.
It is a fitting punishment, although it may seem harsh to you Humans.’
‘It is not what we have been used to,’ said Floy.
‘But I understand.’
‘The only basis for punishment,’ said the Oak, rather severely, ‘is to fit the punishment exactly to the transgression.
It is a practice which has been followed in Ireland, since the High King Erin introduced it.
He was strong and wise and believed in exact and precise forms of justice.’
‘I see,’ said Floy, who did not completely see, but who understood the premise.
‘And now,’ said the Oak, ‘you will wish to continue your journey, Human creatures.’
Its wise eyes were kindly and interested.
‘We shall wish you Good Speed and Safe Arrival.’
It sounded like some kind of ritual in the way the Oak said it and the other Trees bowed their heads in acknowledgement.
Floy said, ‘We thank you all,’ and hoped that this had the correct formality.
‘And we shall hope to meet you again,’ said Snodgrass and the Trees suddenly looked pleased and unexpectedly Human.
The Silver Birches giggled in a skittish fashion and the Copper Beeches shook out their  rippling manes of glowing leaf-hair and regarded the two Renascians through the red-gold curtains.
‘Perhaps you would do well to rest for the night and journey on by daybreak,’ said the Oak.
‘If you will accept the hospitality of the Wolfwood, we shall assure you of safety and warmth.’
‘Well — thank you very much,’ said Floy.
‘But I believe we must go on.
It is a question of — of meeting up with our people, you see.’
‘Then,’ said the Oak, bowing its wise solemn head, ‘we shall not detain you.’
There was a murmur of assent and the wise, strange heads were dipped in the gesture of acknowledgement they had used earlier and the Tree Spirits moved away, not quite fading into the gloom of the forest, but somehow becoming one with it.
The moon was high above them as they walked cautiously through the dark forest and the pale, eerie light lay across the woodland path, cold and unfriendly.
Over their heads, the trees interlaced their branches so that only tiny patches of the velvet night sky were visible.
‘And the Tree Spirits have retreated,’ said Floy, softly.
‘Yes.
Interesting creatures, those Trees,’ said Snodgrass, trotting along beside Floy.
‘We should perhaps have asked the Trees the best path to take,’ said Floy, presently.
‘It's only that this is such a vast place,’ said Snodgrass, firmly.
‘That's all it is.
Renascia was so small that you hadn't to plan journeys at all.
You could go from one end of Renascia in two days and from side to side in three.
We aren't used to such — such hugeness.
The Wolfwood's immense.’
Floy said, ‘If we could find the path to the Forest Court we could be sure of help.’
‘And food,’ said Snodgrass, rather sepulchrally.
‘We left the food with the horses, in those packs.’
‘Well, we can't be far from either the road or the Forest Court,’ said Floy.
‘I won't believe that we're lost.
And look, if we —’
‘What?’
‘I was going to say if we carve notches on the Trees, at least we shan't go round in circles,’ said Floy, grinning.
‘I don't think we'd better do that, however.’
‘Bless my soul, no,’ said Snodgrass, shocked.
‘We could make a — a circle of stones, though,’ said Floy.
‘At the foot of the Trees.
That's more or less what we were going to do for Fenella and Caspar.
Yes, look, we'll do that, and then at least we shan't go round in circles.’
They walked on, scanning the shadows, leaving markers at the foot of the Trees, trying to gauge their direction by the stars.
‘But the trouble is that we don't know the pattern of the stars here,’ said Snodgrass, who had sent himself quite dizzy by standing perfectly still and craning his neck as far back as he could in order to see the night sky.
‘We could have done it on Renascia, because we knew where the stars where and what their names were.
But here there's so much of  everything.
Stars and forests and paths.’
Floy was becoming uneasily aware of the looming bulk of the Trees and of the scurryings and the rustlings and the patterings of unseen creatures all about them.
Night was all about them and the Wolfwood was a strange, none-too-safe place.
It was very easy to imagine eyes peering from the gloom, or strange beings creeping along the path behind them.
And there is magic abroad here …
I wish Nuadu had not said that, he thought.
Snodgrass said, ‘Do you know, I believe the Trees are thinning.
Over there.’
‘Where?
Oh, there.
Yes, I can see,’ said Floy, with a rush of thankfulness.
‘Yes, you're right.’
And quickened his steps because, of course, they had not been lost at all and, of course , it had been ridiculous to think they had been.
They had simply come a little deeper into the forest than they had realised.
At any minute they would see the two horses and they would mount them and ride on down the road and all would be well.
It might even be rather pleasant to ride through this strange, beautiful world with the silver moonlight.
Floy had begun to get the hang of riding after a while.
It was a question of balance and of bumping when the horse bumped.
And on horseback they would feel so much safer.
They would be able to gallop hard away from anything that might spring out at them.
It was remarkable how unsafe it had felt walking through the forest like this.
They made their way through the thinning trees, the moonlight touching the grass with silver, seeing the shadows changing as they neared the forest's edge, becoming thinner, less mysterious, more like ordinary shadows that lay across ordinary roads at night.
Ordinary roads…
The road ahead of them was narrow and winding, silvery and black in the moonlight.
The forest sprawled behind them and ahead of them and, beyond the Trees, they could see the remote, beautiful outlines of mountains.
‘Mountains,’ said Snodgrass, frowning.
‘But there weren't any mountains when we came along the road earlier.’
‘There wasn't forest on both sides of the road either,’ said Floy.
‘Then — it's a different road.’
‘It must be,’ said Floy, staring about him.
‘I've no idea where we are.’
They unrolled the map which had been tucked in Snodgrass's cloak and spread it out carefully on the ground.
It was important to find out exactly where they were, so that they could get back to where they wanted to be.
It was even more important to do this quickly, because they had no food and they had lost the horses.
Wherever they went, they would have to go on foot, which might take a long time.
‘I think we're here,’ said Floy, after a moment, indicating a spot on the map.
‘D'you see the mountains and the Wolfwood?
And this must be the road.’
He pointed, and Snodgrass nodded.
‘We've simply walked across the Wolfwood and come out where another road runs through it,’ said Floy.
‘Well, at least we aren't lost ,’ said Snodgrass, bracingly.
‘No, of course not.’
Floy frowned at the map.
‘We can go back through the Wolfwood and hope that we reach our original road again,’ he said.
‘Although that might take some time, of course.’
He glanced at the sky.
Was it already streaked with the first faint grey fingers of dawn?
Perhaps not.
‘If we continued down this road here , we'd still reach the Fire Court,’ said Snodgrass, who was quite good at maps and found them interesting.
‘We'd approach it from the south instead of the east, that would be all.
But it looks much quicker than re-tracing our steps.’
He glanced uneasily in the direction of the Wolfwood and then said, ‘What about Fenella?’
But Floy had already faced this one.
‘We have almost certainly missed Fenella by now,’ he said.
‘If they set out from Tara at the hour they intended, they will have gone down the forest road hours earlier.’
‘While we were trying to find our way in the Wolfwood,’ said Snodgrass.
‘Perhaps while the Trees were setting about Balor.
Dear me, yes.’
‘Fenella will go on to the Fire Court, of course,’ said Floy, who had very nearly managed to convince himself of this.
‘Caspar will be with her and he knows the roads.’
He did not listen too closely to the small, cold voice that had persistently asked how far they could trust Caspar.
He thought they could be almost sure about Caspar.
I'll have to believe we can trust him, he thought.
And Caspar helped us to escape.
It's important to remember that Caspar helped us to escape.
I won't believe that he was in a plot against us.
He looked back at the map.
‘I think you're right, Snodgrass,’ he said.
‘This road we're on looks to be the shorter way now.
Let's continue on it, shall we?’
Snodgrass thought this would be best.
‘We might lose our way in the forest again if we go back into it,’ he said.
‘We might wander about for hours and waste a great deal of time.
That's a mountain road ahead,’ he said, pointing to the map.
‘That means going a little way into the mountains and I don't see how you could get lost on a mountain road.
You'd have mountains on each side of you and there'd only be one way to go.’
Floy was tracing the road on the map.
‘We shall have to be careful there,’ he said, pointing.
‘The other side of that mountain road.’
‘Why?
What's there?’ said Snodgrass, adjusting his spectacles the better to see.
‘Just over the peak of the mountain,’ said Floy.
‘It's the City of Gruagach.
The City of the Giants.’
They looked at it in silence.
The giantish city, the immense northern township where the Gruagach Giants had lived and lured Humans to their doom.
‘They're no longer there, though,’ began Snodgrass.
‘They're all at Tara,’ and then stopped.
‘No,’ said Floy.
‘The Gruagach are no longer there.
But something else is.
Something that we must avoid at all costs.’
He looked at Snodgrass.
‘Don't you remember?’ he said.
‘When the  Gruagach came storming down from their city to take Tara, Gruagach was taken by the Geimreadh .
The Geimreadh …
The terrible Human-hungry creature that Fael-Inis had warned them against…
Snodgrass said, ‘But can't we avoid Gruagach?’
‘No,’ said Floy, and traced the route again on the map.
‘If we are to reach the Fire Court, we must pass close to the City of Gruagach.
‘We shall be inside the territory of the Frost Giantess.’
Chapter Twenty-six
Fenella stood very still and stared at the dark, hunched buildings at the side of the road.
The Workshops of the Robemaker…
Dark and imbued with the evil of the necromancer and forbidding beyond anything she had ever seen.
And Nuadu is in there…
She had not expected anything quite so twisted and stunted-looking.
A miasma of despair rose from the cluster of black Workshops and Fenella felt it billow out and engulf them in its sick, cold desolation.
‘And there is a sour sad scent on the air,’ said Caspar unexpectedly, his eyes on the workshops.
‘The scent of despair.’
They were standing on the side of the road, with the forest behind them and the Robemaker's Workshops directly ahead.
It was not quite night, but it was very nearly night.
The Purple Hour…
Fenella shivered, because surely if there were any creeping darknesses abroad here, they would be abroad now, with the twilight stealing through the Wolfwood behind them…
But it was important not to think about things like shadows and creeping, unseen things.
It would be better to concentrate on finding a way into the Workshops and getting to Nuadu and bringing him out.
And I suppose, thought Fenella, with a sidelong glance at her companion, that I shall have to find a suitable way, an acceptable way, of explaining about Nuadu to Caspar.
In the uncertain light, they could see the dull glow that emanated from the Workshops and they could hear the steady thrumming of the Looms.
‘They never cease,’ said Caspar at her side.
‘They must never cease, otherwise the Power they draw down will be broken.’
He frowned.
‘All sorcerers know that,’ he said, ‘but only the Black Sorcerers use Humans to turn the treadmills.’
‘How else can they be turned?’ asked Fenella, partly from interest, but partly because it would be a good idea to know as much as possible about the Workshops.
‘They use water quite of ten,’ said Caspar.
‘Like mills.’
And looked at her questioningly.
But Fenella knew about mills and mill wheels.
‘Or they use minor sorceries,’ said Caspar.
‘The best sorcerers do that.
They create another source of power, a secondary source, to turn the Looms.’
And Fenella remembered the thin, frayed legend of how the Earth-people, at one time in their history, had created a race of machines and how they had then created machines to run the  machines and how it had all got out of hand.
So, after all, there was nothing so very new in the world…
‘Will the Robemaker be in there, do you suppose?’
Fenella was trying to decide how to explain to Caspar about the captured Nuadu.
‘Or might he be out looking for other slaves to turn the Looms?’
Nuadu had said that the Robemaker and CuRoi took sacrifices from the ordinary people of Ireland; strong young sons to work at the Looms, although presumably they would not actually do this work themselves.
Had they servants to do it?
Or was it done by necromancy?
‘They say that, for some of the time, the Robemaker dwells in the heart of the Dark Realm,’ said Caspar and glanced over his shoulder uneasily.
‘But he might as easily be here.
We can't be sure.
That's why we'd better move on without any delay.’
But Fenella, who had twice now seen the terrible hooded and cloaked shape creep up on her, thought that the Robemaker was not here.
There had been a heaviness in the air on the Robemaker's approach those other times; a cold, greasy feel, as if thick, oily fog had swirled out into the clean air.
‘I'm going to look inside,’ she said at length, and Caspar turned to stare at her.
You can stay here or go on without me,’ said Fenella, returning the stare very straightly.
‘I don't much mind, although I'd prefer you stay.
But whatever you do, I'm going to look inside.’
Caspar, genuinely appalled, said, ‘But don't you know that it's almost the most dangerous place in the whole of Ireland?’
And looked at her and said, ‘You don't know, do you?
But it truly is, Fenella. if the Robemaker is there, or even if one of his horrid spells — what they call Sentry Spells — is lurking, we'd be taken up and captured before you could say Gruagach.
I'd be put to work on the Looms and you'd be —; Well,’ said Caspar, who, despite his work for the Court and later the Gruagach, had retained a vestige of delicacy, ‘well, I'd rather not say what might happen to you.
Let's go on to the Fire Court.
We can't be so very far from it now.’
Fenella was trying to be very patient, because it was not in the least unreasonable of Caspar to want to go on and leave the Dark Workshops as far behind them as possible.
She weighed the advantages of telling him about Nuadu and the terrible crimson mask against the matter of his allegiance.
Was there a middle course she could take?
Something to account for her needing to get into the Workshops, but something that did not give away the Beastline people's plans to attack Tara?
Yes, of course there was.
‘Caspar,’ said Fenella, looking at him very intently.
‘We didn't tell you the entire truth, Floy and I.’
‘Didn't you!’ said Caspar, suspiciously.
‘When we arrived here,’ said Fenella, and spared a thought for the absurdity of these words, because the manner of their arriving had been something so remarkable as to defy explanation or description.
‘When we arrived here,’ she said, firmly, ‘we lost one of our — our party.
‘Well?’ said Caspar.
‘He — the Robemaker took him,’ said Fenella.
‘And we vowed to try  to rescue him.’
She looked back at the huddle of low-roofed buildings.
‘He's in there,’ she said, and something so sad and so wistful entered her voice that Caspar, who was by no means insensitive, looked at her more intently.
‘We must get him out,’ said Fenella, abandoning all pretence.
‘Please, won't you help me?’
Caspar hesitated.
As well as not being insensitive, he was by no means impervious to the sudden plea for help from a young and attractive lady.
He had never met anyone quite like Fenella and he found her rather intriguing.
He supposed he was more or less honour bound to help her.
But his eyes went back to the Workshops and he frowned and sought for the right thing to say.
‘If you won't,’ said Fenella, ‘I shall quite understand.
But I shall have to go in by myself, that's all there is to it.’
She studied the Workshops, frowning, and Caspar, who was becoming alarmed by this time, saw that this was no ruse to secure his assistance; Fenella intended to get into the Robemaker's Workshops and rescue whoever it was who was in there.
And whether he went with her or not, she would do it.
This was not something that could be allowed, not by anybody's standards.
So he said that they could perhaps take a look round to see were there any secluded windows anywhere or any openings where they might just squeeze through.
And heard his voice saying these things with appalled horror.
‘That,’ said Fenella warmly, ‘is a very good idea.
You should always inspect the terrain before going into battle.’
And then, ‘I read that somewhere,’ grinned Fenella.
‘Shall we try this side first?’ and was off before Caspar had time to collect his thoughts.
He managed to detain her long enough for them to tether the horses, because there would be no sense in coming out of the Workshops (with, or without the prisoner) and finding that the horses had turned their heads for Tara and that they had to walk the rest of the way to the Fire Court.
He thought, privately, that they might be very glad of the horses, because they might find that they came out of the Workshops much faster than they went in, but he did not say this.
‘Ready?’ said Fenella, having helped with the tethering and fastening her cloak more tightly about her shoulders.
‘No,’ said Caspar gloomily.
‘No, I'm not ready and I wish I hadn't come, if you really want to know.
In fact, if you want the truth, I wish I was back at Tara with the Gruagach.’
‘That's not at all the way to think,’ said Fenella severely.
‘We'll get inside somehow and we'll find the — the person who was captured and be out again before you know it!’
She sent him the sudden grin again and Caspar said, ‘Oh dear me,what optimism,’ but he said it quietly.
Fenella moved down the narrow, steep slope with the stunted trees and the blackened, scarred ground and felt, as she neared the Workshops, a thick, clotted malevolence belching out towards them.
It was rather like going down into a horrid, dark, earthy hole, where dull crimson firs burned and where grinning creatures might be peering at you from the shadows.
But I don't believe there are, thought Fenella firmly.
I truly don't believe there are.
The Robemaker isn't here — I know he isn't here — and we shall find a way to get inside and Nuadu will be there and we shall bring him out.
Caspar walked rather ploddingly along at Fenella's side, but Fenella thought that at least he was at her side and found this unexpectedly comforting.
There had been one or two Earth stories of how warriors going into battle had gone shoulder to shoulder, which had always seemed a rather odd expression, but which suddenly made sense.
Caspar was not the ideal person to be shoulder to shoulder with, because he would probably melt away altogether if there was a real threat.
But at least he is here, she thought, and wondered if she would really have tried to get into the Workshops by herself if she had had to.
Would I?
Oh yes, if it meant rescuing Nuadu.
As they neared the Workshops, Fenella heard the continuous thrumming of the Looms and saw the pulsating red glow of the furnaces.
She thought that the sound and the scent would surely hammer your mind into a state of numbness, eventually.
What must it be like to be imprisoned here, day after day, month after month?
I wonder, does he keep them chained and manacled, thought Fenella, or does he use sorcery?
And, so utterly immersed was she in this strange blue and green land that was not feeling strange any more, that she did not even notice that she was weighing sorcery against steel chains and seriously considering the likely outcome.
Closer to, the Workshops were much larger than either of them had realised.
They seemed to stretch back into the hillside as if they might, at some stage, cease to become manmade buildings of stone and wood and brick and become ancient caves; tunnels that would penetrate deep into the earth's core.
The walls were built of dark, rough stone, almost black, pitted here and there by the heat of the furnaces.
There were narrow high windows, far above them; Fenella thought they would open on to rooms at a higher level than the ground.
The windows had a sly, mean look, and Fenella had the sudden impression that the Workshops were not workshops at all, but a single crouching monster, black and hard-backed and scaly on the outside, but possessed of roaring, flaming innards, so that every breath it took belched out hissing steam and curls and wisps of flame.
The windows are its eyes, she thought, staring upwards.
They are the eyes of the monster, red and evil and calculating, and they are watching us, those eyes, and thinking: oh yes, here are two very useful morsels of Humanity…
And I had better not think like that, said Fenella silently, or I shall be too afraid to go any nearer.
I'll concentrate on getting inside, getting to Nuadu.
‘The Looms generate immense heat,’ said Caspar, as they drew nearer and Fenella flinched from the dry, gusty warmth.
‘It'll probably be quite uncomfortable.’
‘Very uncomfortable, I expect,’ said Fenella and went on studying the black stone buildings to see if there was a small, partly hidden door that they might use to get inside.
As they skirted the western side of the Workshops, they both saw how the grass here was blackened, the walls charred in places, the great smokestacks thickly crusted with cinders.
Fenella, moving ahead, saw, as Nuadu had not been able to see, that there were tiny cracks in the walls, from which the glowing heat threw out threads of fiery light and through which little angry hisses of steam continually escaped.
Caspar was peering along the darkened west wall, when Fenella said in a whisper, ‘Caspar!
See over there?
An open window.
Exactly what we want.’
‘Yes.
Yes, it is.
And,’ said Caspar, ‘there doesn't seem to be any heat coming from it.
There certainly isn't any light to speak of in the windows.
Does that mean there are no furnaces in there, I wonder?’
‘Might it be a storeroom?
Set a bit apart?’
The open-windowed room looked as if it was quite far away from the main body of the Workshops.
And surely there must be fuel of some kind to feed the great furnaces, and surely there would have to be a store-place.
‘It could be a Welhouse,’ said Fenella.
‘Which would make it a good place to try to get in.’
‘They say the Robemaker uses human fuel,’ said Caspar, half to himself, and then, ‘Fenella, do you really think we ought to be doing this?
Wouldn't it be better to raise help of some kind?’
‘What kind of help?’ said Fenella.
And then, ‘Caspar, have you ever actually seen the Robemaker?
Really seen him?’
‘Well, no.’
‘I have,’ said Fenella and repressed a shiver.
‘And he's evil and merciless and terrible.
He'd fell you with an enchantment in an instant.
And he'd never be defeated just by strength.
If you sent a great army against him, he'd simply cut it down with his sorcery.
It's stealth and trickery that's needed to outwit him.’
The place that Fenella thought might be a fuelhouse was a small, added-on section, jutting out from the main body of the Workshops.
Fenella remembered the houses on Renascia and how they had nearly always had sculleries and washing houses jutting out from the main rooms.
This had the same kind of look to it.
It was a part of the main building, but it was not a central part.
Probably it was not used very much and probably they could climb through the window and be inside without anyone even realising.
‘I suppose you want me to go first,’ said Caspar as they stood looking up at the open window, which was grimy and smeary, but much lower than the other windows.
‘I'd go first,’ said Fenella, who would do so unhesitatingly.
‘I'm perfectly capable of climbing through a window.
But I can't reach the window by myself.
You go up first and then help me.’
‘Let's not be hasty,’ said Caspar, moving to the window.
‘Let's just take a look first and wait till we see what's inside.’
He grasped the narrow sill and hauled himself up so that he hung, partly suspended by his hands, his chin level with the lower sill.
‘Can you see?’
Fenella was standing on tiptoe alongside him, but the window was too high and she could not see.
‘What can you see?’ said  Fenella.
And then, as Caspar drew in a shocked gasp, ‘Caspar, what's in there?’
Caspar let go of the sill and slid rapidly to the ground with a bump, looking a bit sick.
‘Oh, dear me,’ he said, standing back from the window and dusting himself down, wiping his face with a handkerchief.
‘Dear, dear me!
I never thought to see such nastiness, not even serving the Gruagach, I didn't.
Well, it's no sight for a lady, that I do know.
I think we'd better forget the whole idea.’
He eyed Fenella uncertainly and Fenella, who was becoming impatient, said, ‘Well, for heaven's sake —’ which was an expression she had picked up from Snizort and Snodgrass and which was as meaningless as most of their expressions, but descriptive of strong emotion.
‘Do come away,’ said Caspar, taking her arm.
‘I promise you we'd be much better to go quietly back on to the road and make our way to the Fire Court.’
‘You can go to any number of Fire Courts,’ said Fenella, crossly.
‘But I'm going in there whether you come with me or whether you run away.
I don't much care which,’ said Fenella, who did not really want Caspar to ride off and leave her alone out here, but who was not going to get so close to Nuadu and then ride away and leave him.
‘And first of all, I'm going to climb through the window,’ she said and reached for a stack of sacking which had been thrown down near the wall and which, piled carefully, might enable her to reach the sill.
‘I wish you wouldn't,’ said Caspar, but Fenella took a deep breath and clambered on to the sacks and grasped the window ledge, rubbing a bit of the window pane clear.
And looked in.
The storeroom (yes, she had been right about that after all) was not very big and not very well lit.
There seemed to be a door cut into the wall that was farthest away from the window; Fenella, trying to get her bearings, thought it would lead more deeply into the Workshops, perhaps even back and back into the cave part.
Odd pieces of broken and split machinery were strewn about or propped against the walls.
The room looked to be what they had thought; a store or perhaps a fuelhouse which might be left unattended for most of the time.
The sort of deserted outbuilding that might easily be forgotten, until a fresh supply of fuel was needed.
The twisted machinery pieces cast shadows on the floor, weird and grotesque, so that, for a heart-stopping moment, Fenella thought that strange beast-things were crouching in the corners and remembered that Caspar had said something about Sentry Spells; minor enchantments that the Robemaker might have left on guard in his absence.
But light was spilling in through the seams of the door at the far end of the room; crimson, glowing light from whatever lay on the other side.
After a moment Fenella's eyes grew used to the dimness and she could see quite plainly into the room.
She could see what had made Caspar turn pale and sick.
A great pile of felled Trees.
Trees which had been hacked and chopped and mutilated, which had had branches torn away so that they could be roughly stacked against the wall.
Fuel for the Robemaker's  roaring furnaces that must never be allowed to cool…
But the Trees were not just Trees.
They were people, beings, half-formed creatures who might have been strange and beautiful and filled with wild, woodland magic.
Beings who were now dead or dying, and who were lying in tangled, dreadfully mutilated heaps.
Fenella, clutching the narrow ledge, standing precariously on the piled sacks, thought, in horror:Miach's spell .
The emerging of the Tree Spirits.
What had Miach called them?
Naiads and Dryads and Hamadryads.
Nymphs and oreads and nereids.
Beautiful, half-human forms, partly emerged from the ancient beeches and oaks and elms and birches and ash Trees, taking shape under the summoning of Miach's magic.
But here were hacked limbs and truncated bodies.
Strange, greenish — gold fluid staining their skin which was not quite skin and not quite leaf.
Tree-blood flowing down, mingling with the rippling bronze hair of the copper beeches and the pale, frond-like arms of the ash Trees and the poor, split, high-arched feet of the silver birches.
There was a deep, thick blood from the old oaks, still trickling slowly out here and there, as if the Trees might not have been cut down so very long since, or — and this was much worse — as if there were still vestiges of life in them.
Branches and limbs and hair and eyes all jumbled and mixed, so that you could not tell where the Tree part ended and the naiad part began.
The ancient Tree Spirits, awakened by magic after their centuries-old sleep, captured and taken by the Robemaker.
Bound and held by his terrible evil magic, thought Fenella, sickened.
Held, perhaps, by the crimson rope-lights, as Nuadu was held, and then butchered and slain and thrown into a dark woodshed, to await burning in the heart of a necromancer's fiery furnace…
‘I'm going to climb in,’ said Fenella, at last, and pointed to a thick chunk of dried-out wood.
‘We can drag that underneath the window and then I'll be able to get through the window.’
‘Best oak,’ said Caspar, looking at the log and shaking his head.
‘The Robemaker must have been taking the Trees for years.’
‘Well, we mustn't think about it now,’ said Fenella in a practical voice.
‘It can't hurt the Oak now if I stand on it to get in, can it?
No, I didn't think it could.
Would you help me up?’
But Caspar, belatedly gallant, said that it was for him to lead the way.
‘I'll go in first and then pull you up.’
‘It would be much easier if I went in first and then you could push me up,’ said Fenella.
‘It doesn't seem right,’ said Caspar, half to himself.
‘It doesn't seem polite if you know what I mean.’
‘We can't worry about manners.
Do hurry,’ said Fenella impatiently.
Fenella clambered cautiously on to the oak log and grasped the ledge.
if the Robemaker had left any Sentry Spells, then surely this was the moment for them to come rearing out to challenge the intruders.
She sat for a moment on the narrow window ledge, scanning the shadows in case shapes, creatures, sentinels should materialise.
But nothing happened and Fenella felt a small, frail spiral of confidence  and thought that the very suggestion that the Robemaker needed sentries at all indicated that he was not as all-powerful as they had feared.
And if he has left any to catch us, then they aren't very good, she thought.
We're partway in already.
‘Hurry up!’ said Caspar urgently, from outside.
He hauled himself after her and Fenella gasped and half fell, half pulled herself over into the Robemaker's wood-store, to be followed, a minute later, by a rather out-of-breath Caspar.
They stood silently together in the dim, rather narrow room, with the sharp scent of the butchered trees all about them and, underneath it, a soft, sad scent that Fenella thought must be the spilled Tree-blood.
In the red-lit dimness it was possible to see the mutilated Tree Spirits more plainly now and Fenella thought there had never been anything quite so dreadful.
They were not all quite dead.
Fenella and Caspar could see this clearly; they could see that some of the Tree Spirits were still breathing, shallowly and painfully, their strange, wise faces shuttered and suffering, their branches torn from their bodies and great, gaping wounds still bleeding.
‘Terrible,’ said Caspar, rather pale.
‘Can't we do anything for them?’
‘I don't think so,’ said Caspar.
‘I think they are too — too cruelly hurt.’
‘We'd better try to find the prisoners,’ said Fenella at last, although she did not really want to leave the comparative safety of the wood-store.
‘Through there, do you think?’
‘As well there as anywhere,’ said Caspar.
The door that Fenella had indicated was the one with ill-fitting seams that permitted the red glow to seep through.
It was wider than it had looked and Fenella thought she had been right to think it led away from the road, deeper into the hillside.
‘Can you hear anything?’ she said as they stood looking round.
‘I can hear the Looms,’ said Caspar.
‘But then, they never stop.’
He listened for a moment.
‘I can't hear anything,’ he said.
‘Ready?’
‘Ready,’ said Fenella.
‘We'll leave this door propped open,’ said Caspar.
‘In case we need to —’
‘Escape quickly.’
‘Yes.’
And then, because there did not seem to be any reason to wait, they moved cautiously to the door at the far end of the wood-store and inched it open.
The noise and the dull angry light of the furnaces poured in.
Chapter Twenty-seven
Caspar and Fenella stood in the Workshops, with the wood-store behind them, their skin shrivelling and flinching and every sense assaulted by what was before them.
The room they were in stretched back and back — Into the hillside, thought Fenella — and far above them.
In the evil, glowing red light they could see that the walls were not of brick or timber or of anything that walls were normally made of.
They were earth; dark, hard-packed earth, here and there cracking with the endless dry heat.
There was the feeling of being in a dark, hot cave and there was the sudden swift impression of ancient malevolent creatures that dwelled here and slept for decades, or sometimes centuries, until they were disturbed…
There are things in here that are sometimes asleep and sometimes not asleep, thought Fenella.
Sentry spells?
Yes, perhaps.
I can feel them, thought Fenella, standing very still just inside the huge, high-ceilinged, firelit room.
I can feel that there are forces in here that could very easily be woken and, if they are woken, they would come crawling and slithering out from their lair and we would not have very much chance against them…
At the far end, huge double doors opened on to the furnace room.
The doors were partly open, showing the great iron stoves and the furnaces and the immense black pipes that disappeared into the floor.
Billowing gusts of heat came from the furnaces and they could see the immense iron hods of wood, waiting to be fed to the furnaces.
I hope their spirits are dead, she thought.
I hope they are not like the ones we found in the store, still a bit alive.
Directly in front of them were the treadmills; huge, fearsome, steel and mesh wheel-cages, stretching far above them, at least twelve or fifteen feet high, great roaring, relentless, nightmare machines which rotated on and on.
Fenella, horrified, her mind tumbling, saw that the treadmills were like huge fly-wheels, like the sides of giant spinning tops.
They gyrated endlessly round and round…
Immense grinding, grating, pounding things…
On and on, and up and up…
And then down again to begin the circle over again.
To watch the ceaseless spinning for too long made you feel sick and dizzy and a bit out of step with everything else.
The noise was dreadful.
It was a continual clanking, rotating sound, a whirring rhythmic, steel-against-steel sound that made your teeth wince.
Fenella and Caspar staring, saw that huge spindles and cogs and pinions protruded from the dark-packed earth of the ceiling and that the motion of the great wheels caused these to turn and rotate and drive  one another into rather horrid, grinding, gobbling motion.
The red glow from the furnaces fell across the treadmills, turning the steel mesh to angry crimson, bathing the creatures inside them to eerie, unnatural life, blending and merging them with the machinery, until it was very nearly impossible to tell where the treadmills ended and the human creatures began…
The human creatures…
Within each treadmill were two workers; chained and manacled.
Affixed horizontally to the inside of the treadmill were stout iron bars for the prisoned workers to grasp.
Fenella, who understood in a vague way about mill wheels and how they had to rotate continually to provide power, saw with horror that the slaves inside the steel mesh cages were forced by the motion of the wheels to tread endlessly forward to keep the treadmills revolving.
Each of them must tread on and on, a ceaseless, bone-grinding trudge, if they did not want to be taken up and up by the gyrating treadmill into the clanking, turning cogs in the roof and ground to dust between the pinions.
They must tread ever forward, regardless of discomfort, heedless of exhaustion.
Sweat poured from their bodies and they wore only the thinnest of breeches.
Their feet were bare and, even from where she stood, Fenella could see the knotting of the leg muscles from the agonising cramp which they must surely suffer almost continuously.
In every case, dried blood caked the mesh cages and the thick iron bars which they used for the momentum of walking.
A look of hopeless desolation, of almost animal acceptance was in their faces; they had long since passed beyond defiance and hope; their life was bounded by the ceaseless rotating of the treadmills which served the Robemaker's Looms.
Their life had become a never-ending trudge to keep the Looms of the necromancer weaving dreadful enchantments.
Sparks flew from the mesh cages and Fenella saw that great black iron pipes ran from beneath each wheel, along the wooden floor and out through a massive, carved silver door at the other end of the Workshop.
She glanced at Caspar and saw that he was staring at the silver door.
Somewhere through that door must be the Chamber of the Looms, the powerhouse of the Workshops, the force field of the necromancer.
The clanking of the machines was almost deafening, and Fenella wanted to clap her hands to her ears and try to shut it out.
But she stayed where she was, her eyes raking the red lit chamber.
Presently, she grew a little more adjusted to the noise and she began to make out the details a little more plainly; she could see that the captives were all young men, some of them not much more than boys, but certainly strong and lithe.
She thought that not one of them could be more than eighteen or twenty, and she remembered how it had been said that the Robemaker scoured Ireland, taking the sons of the ordinary Irish families to work here.
And then Caspar, who had been narrowing his eyes and taking stock of everything and everyone, suddenly gripped Fenella's arm and said, in a voice from which most of the breath had been driven, ‘Fenella — over there.’
‘What —’
‘The Prince,’ said Caspar, softly.
Fenella looked to where he indicated, to the farthest of the treadmills and saw the single creature held captive there, and her heart jumped and missed several beats, and then went on again erratically.
Nuadu Airgetlam.
The Wolfprince.
To begin with, they thought that the Robemaker had injured him in some unimaginable way, for the crimson mask still had him in its grip and in the flickering light, it looked for a moment as if the lower part of his face was covered in blood.
Fenella gasped and then thrust her clenched fist into her mouth, because she would not, she emphatically would not give way to polish emotion.
But she moved at once and stood below the pounding clanking mesh wheel, looking up.
She saw him look down at her and saw that his skin was raw and flayed in places; the arm of flesh and blood was scraped and scorched and the silver arm on the other side was reflecting the tremendous heat, so that it was copper coloured and glinting and must be causing him immense pain.
But his eyes still held the old mockery and the remembered cynicism.
So you have sought me out, Human Child…
Fenella, hardly daring to speak, but knowing she must raise her voice above the treadmills, said, ‘Where is —’ And saw his eyes smile, as if to say: he is not here for the moment.
For the moment, you are safe.
And then there was a warning flare and Nuadu's eyes moved in the direction of the shadowed corners.
Fenella followed his eyes and at once said, ‘Sentry Spells,’ and there was a gleam of acknowledgement above the glinting mask.
‘Yes,’ said Fenella, looking up at Nuadu.
‘Yes, I understand.
And we will be wary.’
And wondered, in the same moment, how they could possibly hope to cheat the Sentry Spells.
Caspar had crossed the room to stand at her side and he said, ‘Sire —’ And stopped in some confusion, because he had known Nuadu at once— he thought every person in Ireland would recognise him, for the wolfblood was unmistakable, and everyone knew the story of the Queen's bastard wolfson and the fierce quarrels that had taken place between her and the King when Nuadu was born.
He understood, as well, why Fenella had been so chary of telling the entire truth.
Because I suppose I must have appeared a bit untrustworthy, thought Caspar, what with working for the Gruagach and everything.
I suppose I can't blame her or Floy for being wary, he thought, rather sadly.
But he was a bit flummoxed at the reality of Nuadu, because nobody had ever told him how to address a bastard of the Ireland's Royal House.
However, it would be better to err on the side of too much courtesy, and so, ‘Sire,’ he said firmly, ‘if there is a way to get you out, we will find it.’
Nuadu's eyes went to the other captives and Fenella at once said, ‘Yes, of course, all of you.
If only there is a way —’ And stopped, because Nuadu's eyes had gone to the silver door.
‘In there?
Do you mean —’ Fenella stopped, trying to read the meaning in the dark eyes above the dreadful mask.
‘Do you mean there  is a — is there a spell we could use?
Oh, but —’ And stopped and felt, with remembered delight, the shower of golden needle lights as his thoughts poured into her mind.
It is the only way, Human Child…
The only thing that will release us is the thing that imprisoned us.
Magic, Fenella.
And in there is the Robemaker's cache of enchantments…
The stockroom of spells…
The necromancer's treasure-house.
But beware the Melanisms, Fenella.
They are the Robemaker's sentinels, the effluence of necromancy, and you must be very very wary indeed of them .
The Melanisms…
Fenella stayed where she was for a moment, still staring up at the imprisoned Nuadu.
The Melanisms…
With the words had come the fleeting impression of dark, sinuous creatures who could slither out of the shadows and wind their cold, serpentine fingers about you, so that you were trapped, who could twine about your entire body, so that you were smothered and suffocating from the cold embrace…
‘But there isn't really any choice,’ said Fenella, firmly, and turned to the ornate silver door at the far end of the room.
Fenella had expected the silver door to feel cool and silvery and solid and was surprised when it actually felt extremely hot.
‘Yes, that'll be the Looms,’ said Caspar.
‘This will be an ante-chamber, mark my words.
It'll be very hot because of being so near to the Looms themselves.
We wouldn't get near to the Looms, of course.
Well, very likely we won't get near to the store house, either.
We'll very likely be burned to a crisp the minute we get in there.
Still, it's all one to me.
As well be fried and roasted on that side of the door, as turned to something very nasty by the Robemaker and fed into the furnaces.
I don't care,’ said Caspar.
There would not be very much time.
They both knew this.
Fenella could feel the shadows stirring already; she could feel a dark, slimy something uncoiling somewhere close by.
The Melanisms, the Robemaker's Sentry Spells, torpid and stagnant for most of the time…?
Sleeping in the darkness until some creature, some reckless, heedless Human should try to penetrate the ancient secrets of their Master…?
They are waking, thought Fenella, struggling with the elaborate handle of the silver door, then standing back to give way to Caspar who seemed to understand the mechanism.
The shadows moved; they seemed to darken and to creep nearer, and long, groping fingers of blackness stretched across the floor.
As they began to turn the silver handle with the strange, serpent-like beasts engraved deeply into it, Fenella felt the Melanisms creep nearer.
They are only shadows, she said firmly to herself.
Not solid things at all.
Effluence.
But the Melanisms did not feel like only shadows.
They did not move like shadows; they did not shift and blur.
They crept, developing rudimentary arms with nasty, elongated fingers as they went, groping across the floor towards the two intruders, as if they might not be able  to see, but might be able to feel or smell their way to Caspar and Fenella.
They were blind, seeking things, reaching out, feeling their way closer with every minute.
It was unspeakably horrid to know that a great, slithering, inchoate mass of effluence was crawling and creeping and smelling its way towards you.
Fenella said, a bit impatiently, ‘Oh, do hurry up, Caspar!
Shan't we be able to open it?
Isn't it just an ordinary door?’
‘Of course it isn't,’ said Caspar, crossly.
‘It's a silver door, guarding something that's strongly magical.
I've seen the same kind of thing in the Sorcery Chambers at Tara.
You have to keep turning until there's a kind of silken click.’
Fenella was standing with her back to the silver door, watching the Melanisms.
They were oozing closer, no doubt about it.
I suppose, thought Fenella, that I was rather innocent to think that we could get in so easily, or that the Robemaker would not in some way guard his secrets.
‘Almost there,’ gasped Caspar.
‘I think we're —’ He broke off abruptly as Fenella let out a cry of purest revulsion and looked down to see the Melanisms at their feet, surging thickly upwards.
Fenella had managed to not quite scream.
She had thought she had been keeping watch on the creeping grey-streaked matter, but it had moved suddenly, the embryonic fingers clutching the ground, pulling the oozing, mucousy river forward until it was bubbling over her feet.
She would not scream and she would not panic.
She tried to back away and, at once, the Melanisms seemed to wriggle and chuckle, to slop forward with a dreadful, glutinous, squelching sound.
Fenella, clinging to self-control, thought that it was a gobbling, lip-smacking sound, as if the soupy fluid was savouring her, as if it was going to enjoy bubbling upwards until it had engulfed her entire body…
She sent a frantic look to where Caspar was now standing and saw that the Melanisms had reached him as well now; his legs and knees were already covered.
This is dreadful, thought Fenella, struggling against the thick, cold viscosity.
This is certainly the worst thing that has happened to me ever.
Am I going to be able to get out?
Am I going to be able to pull free?
as if in answer, the Melanisms tightened their hold, sucking and gobbling, the half-formed arms twining themselves about her thighs, tendrils of grey-streaked black curling upwards to her waist.
The heaving fluid was not cold, as it had looked, but slightly warm, as if somewhere at the centre there might be a heart, and veins, and lungs to breathe with…
To reach down and try to free her legs would be disastrous.
The minute she sunk her hands into the glutinous fluid, her hands would be trapped as well.
She had the dreadful thought that once her hands plunged into the foul greasiness, she would feel reaching, grasping hands under the surface, clutching at her, pulling her down until she was drowning.
Drowning in the effluence of necromancy…
Suffocating and smothering in the gelatinous mucous…
Fenella was using every ounce of her strength to climb free, but the  Melanisms were tenacious and strong.
They held on, tightening their grip, and Fenella felt herself being sucked in.
She thought.
but I can't simply stand here and be drowned by this horrid stuff!
I can't just do nothing!
And looked up at Nuadu, encased in the terrible cage of the treadmill, and saw black, bitter fury in his eyes.
Because she was being slowly smothered by the Melanisms?
Or simply because they had come so close to rescuing him?
I won't think about that yet, said Fenella, silently.
Caspar was shouting to her not to struggle, because it would only mean she would sink quicker, but Fenella was struggling fiercely, because she could not just give in.
She was feeling rather sick at the thought of drowning in the creeping, sucking mess.
It was exactly like standing in a cauldron of lukewarm soup and feeling it inch its way up your body.
There were nameless jellylike things within the Melanisms now; eel-like creatures that brushed against her skin and which felt boneless and yet gristly.
She managed to make a half turn so that she could see the silver door, because perhaps she could reach out and reach over and grasp the elaborate handle and somehow pull herself out.
As she did so, Caspar turned with her, and Fenella knew he had had the same idea.
They were both straining to reach, leaning forward as far as they could, agonisingly aware that the door and its ring handle that might have given them some leverage were out of their reach, when another sound fell on their ears.
They both turned back instantly, scanning the shadows, and Fenella saw Nuadu look up, sudden hope in his eyes.
From the other side of the room, from the shadows of the wood-store where they had entered, something was dragging itself across the floor towards them…
There was nothing any of them could do.
Whatever was creeping towards them through the half-open door would have them completely at its mercy.
Fenella and Caspar were both held fast by the wet gumminess of the Melanisms and Nuadu and the Robemaker's slaves were chained and manacled inside the treadmills.
The sounds came nearer; dragging, crawling sounds, as if not one but several creatures were struggling across the floor.
Fenella, her heart thudding frantically, kept her eyes fixed on the door and a fearful hope began to unfurl.
Through the half-open door, into the dry, shrivelling heat of the great, evil-smelling room, there appeared branchlike shapes and then a fall of blood-stained, leaflike hair.
Caspar said, very softly, ‘The Trees.
Fenella, the Trees.’
The wounded Tree Spirits that the Robemaker had hacked and mutilated were coming to the aid of the two Humans who would free the Wolfprince.
Fenella felt ridiculous tears sting her eyes and brushed them away impatiently because this was no time to be emotional.
The Trees were moving slowly and painfully and it was terrible and marvellous to see them.
But will they reach us before this horrid stuff  covers us? thought Fenella, frantically.
Can they reach us?
There looked to be three or perhaps four of the Tree Spirits.
They were twisted and butchered and maimed and it was difficult to see if they had been Oaks or Beeches or Elms or what.
But there was a glint of green and gold still in them, and their eyes were pain-filled, but determined.
The Tree Spirits were clinging to the black iron pipes that ran along the sides of the floor, using them as levers and pulleys to help them across the floor.
At Fenella's side, Caspar said softly, ‘They are unable to stand, poor things,’ and Fenella felt the pity of it hit hard at the base of her throat.
The Trees had crossed half of the floor now and the nearest one — Fenella could see now that it had been a Larch, elegant and slender — was already inching its way across the slimy black pool of the Melanisms, creating a kind of bridge.
As it did so, the other two Tree Spirits did the same, the branches of the Larch reaching forward, until Fenella could lean over and grasp them.
She thought she gasped, ‘Oh, thank you!’ and she felt the Larch incline its head in acknowledgement.
And then she was holding on to the branches, feeling where the Robemaker had hacked and sawn at them, knowing she must be hurting the Larch even more, and trying to be as gentle as possible.
The surface of the Melanisms heaved and panted, and Fenella felt the suction about her waist increase.
The Robemaker's sentries were not letting go easily…
‘Pull harder!’ cried Caspar.
‘Fenella, you must break free!’
‘Yes,’ gasped Fenella.
‘Yes, of course.’
And then the Larch moved back, and Fenella clung to its poor torn branches and the sticky evil effluence melted back, and there was a horrid oozing clutching feeling, and then she was pulled across the floor, and she was free.
The fact that they were both half covered with the slimy grey Melanism-fluid did not have to matter.
Fenella and Caspar both knelt down, taking a gentle hold of the Tree Spirits' maimed branches, searching for the right words to convey their gratitude.
At length, Fenella said, in very nearly a whisper, ‘Thank you, Trees,’ and there was a ripple of awareness from the Trees and a soft rustling of the trailing leaf-hair.
‘Is there nothing we can do to — to save you?’ said Fenella, and saw the wise ancient eyes regarding her.
‘Nothing, Human Creatures,’ said the Larch at last, in a warm, timbery sort of voice.
‘We shall die in the Robemaker's fires.’
‘Can't you simply — escape from your — your Tree homes?’ asked Fenella, unsure whether she understood the principle of all this, but hoping she had conveyed her meaning.
‘We are bound to our heartwood Trees in death,’ said the Larch.
‘We are the Robemaker's victims.’
Its head bowed over.
‘But you must enter the Robemaker's Storeroom of Spells, and free the Prince,’ said one of the others — Fenella thought it was a cypress.
‘He will lead your armies against the Dark Lords.’
‘If you can do that, then perhaps others will not be sacrificed and tortured and become soul-less,’ said a third.
‘Yes,’ said Fenella, who had not really been thinking in terms of armies and battles quite so definitely as this.
But she said, very firmly, ‘Yes, we will do it.’
She eyed Caspar: ‘All right?’
‘Yes,’ said Caspar, who was not really all right, but who was not going to admit to it.
‘A bit muddied and splattered,’ he said.
‘Yes.
But we'll attend to that later,’ said Fenella, who was also muddied and streaked with the oozing matter.
She looked round.
The Melanisms seemed to have retreated into their dark corners again, but Fenella had the feeling that they were simply mustering their strength again; they had been baulked of their prey and they had retired.
But they would slither out again, and they would probably do so quite quickly.
They had not very much time.
‘We'd better be quick,’ said Fenella to Caspar, taking his arm.
‘Hurry up — did we manage to get the silver door open?’
As they moved cautiously towards it, Fenella saw that it had opened for them just the smallest sliver and that beyond it were shards of light.
They pushed the silver door open warily and Fenella stepped forward.
The door swung to behind them, shutting out some of the noise of the treadmills, but it did not quite close.
‘And we'd better make sure that it doesn't,’ said Caspar, moving back to prop the door open with a stone.
‘We don't want to find ourselves locked in here , that would be extremely nasty.
You'd be forever wondering what might come at you from the shadows.
I suppose the Melanisms have gone, have they?
They aren't slithering around in here?’
‘I don't think so.
But we'd better hurry up.’
They both glanced behind them and then moved into the coloured shadows of the necromancer's storeroom.
Chapter Twenty-eight
They were in a rather long, quite narrow chamber, lined with shelves and with long racks with poles.
And suspended from each pole…
‘Oh!’ said Fenella and stood still and clasped her hands together and for a moment forgot entirely about being in danger in the house of an ancient and evil sorcerer.
Because from each pole there hung a robe, and each robe was of a different hue, and every robe was of a different consistency.
‘The Robes of Enchantment,’ said Caspar in an awed voice.
‘The necromancer's wardrobe of spells.’
The Robes shimmered and gleamed and reflected the dim light.
Each one glowed with its own prismatic brilliance and each one was soaked in pure, living colour, in rainbow light, in fluid iridescence.
Fenella's first thought was that the Robes were the most beautiful things she had ever seen.
Her second was that although they might be beautiful, they were not all good.
There was a darkness, a sinister menace clinging to some of them, as if simply to touch them might call up dreadful visions and evil forces.
Caspar was explaining in a hushed voice that they were looking at the Robemaker's stocks of enchantments.
‘The Robes of Spells,’ he said.
‘People consult him.
And they say he will fashion any spell so long as someone will pay him enough.’
‘Pay?’
‘Living bodies.
Living souls,’ said Caspar rather hurriedly, as if he thought it might be dangerous to say things like this aloud.
‘Bodies for fuel, souls for offering to the Soul Eaters.
They say he has traded with the Soul Eaters for centuries, although I don't know why.
Nasty!
Let's not think about it.
Fenella, we should try to find something —’
‘Yes.’
But Fenella still stood, drinking in the wild, glorious kaleidoscope of colours, seeing the marvellous chequerwork of form and shape.
Surely, oh surely, there would be something here that would rescue Nuadu and the other poor creatures…
‘Only,’ she said aloud, ‘only, we do not really know what we are looking for.’
Caspar was moving forward, frowning, inspecting the robes as he passed them, occasionally reaching out a hand to touch a fold of colour.
Fenella saw, with a thrill of horror, that as his hand went through the colours, the robes shivered as if they were not made of plain cloth, but of some living, breathing substance.
Music and colour and the secrets of Men; the innermost desires of the heart and sunlight and twilight and hopes and dreams …
All here, thought Fenella, walking cautiously in Caspar's wake.
Yes, all here.
I  can feel them all, thought Fenella.
Music and colours and dreams and hopes…
Oh yes.
And she thought: but evil longings and greedy desires and black sour emotions, as well.
She put out a wary hand and felt her fingers sink into the softness of a robe made of albescent whiteness, pouring ivory and soft, glinting pearl.
Something good.
Something pure and hopeful and silken.
Perhaps a love potion?
But the one next to it was veined with crimson and dull purple and, as Fenella touched it, she was instantly aware of a stinging pain, a boiling of hot sourness.
She took her hand away at once.
Caspar was studying falls and swathes of crimson and gold.
‘Something nasty these, I should think,’ he said.
‘Can you feel it?’
And Fenella, coming to stand beside him, did feel it.
She touched it warily and again there was the hot, dark heat, the feeling of suffocation closing about her, the surging upwards of bitter scalding liquid, as if she had drunk something that was too hot which was laced with a bitter and evil drug.
The heavy darkness seemed to hover above the deep magentas and purples and damson-hued gowns and, as they moved on again, to where the paler, gentler robes were hanging, the feeling passed.
‘We can differentiate the evil from the good,’ said Fenella, frowning.
‘But we don't know what any of them mean!’ she said.
‘Oh Caspar, this is going to be impossible.’
‘Well, we'll think,’ said Caspar, ‘See now, if the crimsons and the purples are evil —’
‘Yes, very evil,’ put in Fenella.
‘Then the paler ones must be good.’
‘Does it follow?’ said Fenella.
‘And also, can we be sure that the Robemaker would ever weave a good enchantment at all?’
She regarded Caspar and Caspar, to whom this had not occurred, looked more worried than ever.
But he said, thoughtfully, that he believed the Robemaker would weave anything so long as he was paid sufficiently highly.
‘All right.
And,’ said Fenella, studying the robes and frowning, ‘would it matter if we used a — an evil spell to rescue Nuadu and the others?
Would it hurt anyone?’
But Caspar, who had only the sketchiest knowledge of these matters, did not know.
‘Well, could we try one or two?’ said Fenella.
‘Could we simply take an armful out to the treadmills and put them on and see what happened?
Would the Melanisms leave us alone for long enough, I wonder, or would the Robes themselves keep the Melanisms at bay?
This is much more difficult than I thought it would be.
But we can't get so close to freeing Nuadu and fail now.’
She reached out for a pale, beautiful robe that seemed to be a continual pour of colour, like a mountain river with the sun shining on it and, as she did so, there was a whisper of sound behind them.
Fenella whipped round and saw a long and terrible shadow fall across the floor.
The Robemaker was in the room with them.
Fenella had been standing towards the back of the Robe-room, half  hidden by the racks of shimmering robes, but Caspar had been in the centre of the room, midway between two of the racks.
As the Robemaker's shadow fell blackly across the floor, Fenella ducked behind the nearest rack, but Caspar, caught without hope of concealment, simply turned and made the briefest of bows.
‘Good morning to you, Sir Enchanter,’ he said, and Fenella, crouched behind folds upon folds of living colour, half suffocated, heard at once, that he had put on a slightly simple voice.
Hope sprang up in her, because if Caspar could make the Robemaker believe that he was merely foolish and not an intruder, they might have a chance.
It was rather a good device and one which Fenella admitted to herself she would not thought that Caspar capable of thinking up so quickly.
‘Good day,’ said the Robemaker and Fenella suppressed a shudder, because it was the hissing, whispering voice she remembered from the forest road earlier.
‘I have sought you for many a long day,’ said Caspar, cheerfully, pursuing the rather frail ploy he had thought up earlier in case of precisely this eventuality.
‘Yes, I have sought you,’ he said, nodding, half to himself, ‘for they tell me you are quite the best there is.’
He regarded the Robemaker and Fenella, peeping out cautiously, saw him smile a bit vacantly at the hooded figure.
‘And,’ went on Caspar, ‘I do need the best.
That is very important.’
‘Who are you?’
The Robemaker had not closed the door, but he had pushed it to a little.
The red light from the treadmill chamber spilled across the floor.
‘And how did you get in?’
‘Well,’ said Caspar, and then glanced over his shoulder as if to make sure no one was listening, ‘well, the truth of it is, that I work for the Gruagach.
As a procurer,’ he said, and tucked his chins into his neck solemnly and put on an expression that said: and that is a reasonable thing for a man to do, of course.
‘I am not in the way of trafficking with Humans, but I know of the Gruagach,’ said the Robemaker, standing very still.
‘You do not answer my other question, Human.’
‘Oh, about getting in,’ said Caspar, and chuckled to himself.
‘Well, to tell you the truth, Sir Enchanter, I met one of your nasty, wriggling creatures on the way in.’
‘Yes?’ said the Robemaker, and Fenella held her breath, because this, surely, was a trap.
‘It inspected me,’ said Caspar, sounding as if he had found this amusing.
‘It took a look at me and then melted away into the shadows.
I daresay,’ he added, in a confidential tone, ‘that it could see I was no enemy.’
‘Go on,’ said the Robemaker, and Fenella dared to hope again.
‘The Gruagach sent me here,’ began Caspar, and stopped, and then went on with more assurance, ‘they sent me along to see if you can provide a — well, I don't know what you'd call it really.
A spell of some kind for the King.
Is that possible?
Dear me, do you know, Sir, I had no idea this would be so difficult.’
He frowned and chewed his lower lip quite naturally and Fenella, hardly daring to breathe, saw that the Robemaker appeared to be listening.
‘The King,’ said Caspar, having apparently thought matters over, ‘is wishful to marry Flame.
I daresay you'll know of her, will you?’
‘Daughter of the sorceress Reflection and the creature Fael-Inis,’ said the Robemaker, and a sneer had crept into his voice.
‘I know of the Gruagach King's plans and I know of the charlatan Fael-Inis.’
‘Is he a charlatan?’ asked Caspar, apparently interested in this.
‘Well, of course you'd know about that, far more than I would.’
‘He is an illusionist, no more.
As for Reflection —’ The cloaked figure made a quick movement.
‘A dilettante.
A dabbler in magic.
A greedy, grasping, lascivious creature.’
‘Still,’ said Caspar, ‘Inchbad is quite wishful to secure her daughter's hand in marriage.
The blending of two territories, so they tell me.
I don't understand, really.
Well, I don't need to understand.’
He eyed the Robemaker with wide, ingenuous eyes, and beamed.
‘But the thing is, Reflection is being rather — well,very greedy about the Marriage Settlement,’ went on Caspar, feeling that he was doing really rather well with this random blending of truth and fiction.
‘And she has locked Flame up until an agreement is reached.’
‘Daughters need to be whipped into line anyway,’ said the Robemaker rather dismissively.
‘And Reflection was ever over-reaching.’
‘Yes, but you see,’ said Caspar, feeling his way cautiously now, ‘you see, Inchbad would like to talk to Flame himself.
And he — that is, he and Goibniu, thought that if we asked you — well, consulted you — you might provide a spell to get her free,’ said Caspar.
And stood very still and waited — and prayed to every god he had ever heard of that the Robemaker would not utilise the dread Stroicim Inchinn and read into his mind.
He thought the tale was reasonably plausible.
Well, it was the best he had been able to come up with and, if it was not sufficient, he could not think what else he could do.
Had the mention of the Melanisms lulled the Robemaker's suspicions?
Surely a person who had not been caught and killed by the Melanisms could be considered to have been inspected and found harmless.
The Robemaker was standing with his head bowed, sunk in thought.
At length, he said, ‘And the fee?
The price your masters will pay?’
Caspar managed not to breathe a huge sigh of relief, because this sounding very promising indeed.
He grinned rather slyly, and said, ‘We all know your fee, Sir.
And the Gruagach will pay very well.’
He managed to achieve what was nearly a knowing wink.
‘The dungeons at Tara are always filled with Humans.
That,’ said Caspar, managing to inject a note of pride into his voice, ‘that is my responsibility, you know.’
‘I do know,’ said the Robemaker.
‘I have heard of you, Master Procurer, and I know every one of your duties.’
‘Good,’ said Caspar, meaning it, and Fenella, still curled into her uncomfortable corner, crossed her fingers and tried not to disturb the shining folds of the Robes all about her.
‘It can be done,’ said the Robemaker.
‘But I should require — we will say six Humans.’
He did not say this as if he was asking Caspar as if six Humans might be possible or even negotiable.
He simply said it.
My fee.
Take it or leave it.
Caspar at once said, ‘Certainly.’
And beamed again.
‘You will bring them here to me at the fall of the Purple Hour.’
Again, it was a flat statement.
‘I don't — yes, I could do that,’ said Caspar, who could not do it at all, but could see that there was no other answer to be given.
And then, in return, you shall be given the Robe of Human Hands.’
Malevolent amusement gleamed from the shadowed eyes.
‘You will know of the spell, perhaps?
The incantation that must be chanted with the wearing of the Robe?
Open, locks, to the Human's hand …’
He stopped and Fenella repeated the words in her mind.
‘I see.
Well, no, I don't know it as it happens,’ said Caspar.
‘Could you — would you mind just — running over them for me.
I don't remember things too well,’ he added apologetically.
‘And so if you could —’
For answer, the Robemaker lifted his arms out so that the great black cloak fanned out giving him the outline of a massive bat or a creature of prey.
Open, locks, to the Human's hand…
Schism, latches, and sever, turnkeys…
Fly open, bars, dissolve, untie, unchain, unfetter…
Slash and gash and carve and gnaw.
Pluck the splinters of iron, and slice the thews of steel.
Scission and sunder, steal and plunder.
He lowered his arms and folded them, then stood regarding Caspar.
‘Thank you,’ said Caspar.
‘Yes, I think I can remember that.’
The Robemaker inclined his head and turned to open the silver door again, holding out one robed hand to indicate that Caspar should precede him.
‘The Purple Hour,’ said the Robemaker.
‘And six Humans.’
Caspar went out and the Robemaker followed, closing the silver door.
Fenella emerged from her corner only after the footsteps had died away and she was as sure as she could be that there was no danger of the Robemaker returning.
And I am not really sure of it at all, she thought, standing up and looking about her.
I daresay he doesn't even need to walk.
He can probably simply appear.
Materialise where he likes.
She would not think about it.
She would try to find the Robe of Human Hands, which sounded rather horrid, but which would surely release Nuadu and the others.
She would concentrate on remembering the incantation:Open, locks, to the Human's hand …
And I won't think, said Fenella, even for an instant, that the Robe might not be here, that the Robemaker might need to return to weave it on the great Silver Looms.
How long did it take to weave a spell?
It has to be here already, thought Fenella, trying to quiet the frantic thudding of her heart.
I'll make a proper search, and I'll listen very hard, so that I can hear if the Robemaker comes back.
She would start nearest to the door and work her way along the jostling, glistening, pouring swathes of colours.
She would be quick and quiet and efficient and she would not miss a one.
The Robe of Human Hands…
It was not, after all, quite so difficult to allot a vague identity to the Robes.
The dark red and damson robes were heavy and stifling and they could not possibly be what she was looking for.
There were clusters of robes that seemed to pulsate and breathe, and there were others that slithered sinuously and rather nastily when she approached.
There were rainbow clumps of raw colour which sizzled and suddenly coiled into snakelike forms as she approached and lifted serpentine heads to hiss at her; there were pouring cascades of things that had appeared to be silk or velvet, but which were molten gold when she got nearer and made her remember Fael-Inis and the cascading River and the salamanders.
Was there something here that would help them?
But when she reached out a hesitant hand, the heat from the liquid was so intense that she could not get any nearer to it.
Even if this was the Robe they wanted, they would not be able to touch it!
She hesitated over several, dark, rather unobtrusive garments in one corner, thinking that they looked harmless until two creeping, fog-like hands reached for her and an evil chuckle filled the room, so that she shot back to the room's centre out of their reach.
There were robes where the pouring light suddenly solidified into rather grisly bones that rattled and gibbered and, on the same racks, were robes made of several different kinds of skin.
Others were wet and clingy and had pulsing red veins and stringy muscle cords woven into them.
It began to seem that the entire storehouse was made up of substances which looked harmless and beautiful on the surface, but which changed and blurred and coalesced as you approached them.
Perhaps this was some kind of protection.
Perhaps, thought Fenella, the Robemaker had drawn a veil of colour and light over his spells, rather as people covered their favourite gowns or pieces of furniture with dust sheets.
And I am disturbing the veils, she thought.
Towards the far end of the chamber there were several robes half hidden by billowing folds of grey clouds, but which seemed to be composed of eyes as she drew nearer.
Like a veil lifting…
Yes, I was right about that at any rate, thought Fenella.
They are veiled, and they are covered by something thin and light-filled and magical.
And as I get nearer, the veil dissolves.
This is very remarkable.
There was something rather nasty about the robe of woven-together eyes.
Would it be for seeing into people's minds?
Perhaps this was part of the Stroicim Inchinn .
Fenella stood very still and stared at the Robe, seeing that the lids were closed and that here and there the lashes were matted and sticky-looking.
The Stroicim Inchinn …
The thought that this was something that would be more useful than anything else in Ireland formed itself treacherously and slimily in Fenella's mind.
Because with that, we should be able to hear our enemies' thoughts and we should be able to tell what everyone else was planning…
The knowledge of how easy it would be to just reach out and take the Robe of Eyes and wear it and be able to see into other people s deepest thoughts flooded her mind, scaldingly.
Fenella gasped and felt the sour bitterness of evil magic touching her and remembered that the Stroicim Inchinn was the most strongly forbidden enchantment of all, and that whatever else they were going to be doing here, they were not going to be dealing with forbidden spells.
But she looked at the robe again and several of the eyes opened and blinked and swivelled in their sockets, as if they had heard her thoughts and were rather amused by them.
There was a rather sickening, glutinous sound as the eyes moved, the sort of sound you hear if someone with sore eyes rubs them too hard and they squelch.
I'm having nothing to do with it, said Fenella firmly.
It's evil and forbidden and I'm not even thinking about it!
The Robe of human Hands was probably somewhere here, by the Eyes and the Skins and by the cloak made up of what looked like nail and hair…
It must be here, thought Fenella, nearly in despair.
It must be here, please let it be here, and please let me find it.
Open, locks, to the Human's Hand …
Would Caspar be outside somewhere?
Yes, he would certainly not abandon her.
There was not really time to think about Caspar and there was not really any energy to spare to think about him, either.
And then she saw it.
By itself, half hidden against the far wall, nearly obscured by billowing folds of grey cloud that huffed sweet, damp breath into her face as she approached.
The Robe of Human Hands…the enchantment that would release the prisoners…
Yes.
It could not by any stretch of the imagination be anything else.
It was not, as Fenella had supposed, a cloak in the way she knew cloaks.
It did not have shoulders or long enveloping folds or a hood.
It was rather small and it had been hung, quite casually, on a nail protruding from the wall.
It was rather like a large belt; you could probably fasten it about your waist and it would sit snugly over your hips.
If you pulled an ordinary conventional cloak over it, nobody would even see it.
The hands were not, as Fenella had feared, frightening.
They were rather sad; dead-looking, woven and folded and, in places, plaited together.
They were rather submissive-looking hands, as if they might be waiting, quite patiently and happily, until someone might need to make use of them.
It was quite difficult to believe that there could be any animation in them.
It was very difficult, indeed, to believe that they could snap open the cages of the treadmills and free Nuadu and the others.
Open, locks, to the Human's hand …
Would it work?
It must, thought Fenella, snatching the spell off the wall and holding it between her hands as she stood at the silver door, waiting for an indication that the Robemaker had gone.
In the end, it was much easier than she had thought to push the silver door open by a few inches and to stand listening, trying to see, trying  to hear, trying to feel the lingering dark presence.
Had he gone?
Yes, thought Fenella, drawing in a huge breath of relief.
Yes, he has gone.
She was not sure how she could be so certain of this except, perhaps, that there had been a miasma of heaviness, a cold, black diseased feel to the air which was not there now.
Yes, the Robemaker had gone.
She pushed the door wider and slipped through into the treadmill chamber again.
Nuadu's eyes were on her and, as she stood before the giant rotating wheels, she saw amusement in them.
So you have stolen the Robemaker's spells, have you, Fenella?
Well, thought Fenella, it seems that at least I have found the right spell.
At least, Nuadu seems to think I have.
I have got that far.
But what do I do now?
She had not the least idea of what she should do next, other than perhaps to fasten the strange garment about her waist.
Would that be right?
Yes, yes, Human Child!
His eyes were dark and brilliant above the cruel red mask and Fenella stood looking at him, seeing how the fireglow poured over his half-naked body, seeing how the silver of his left arm gleamed in the flickering light and was clamped about the horizontal iron bar with as much assurance as that other flesh-and-blood and muscle arm.
The dark hair clung to his forehead and his body was flushed and glistening and bathed in the dull crimson glow.
He is caged and caught, thought Fenella, staring at him.
He is caged and he is muzzled — and still he is arrogant and defiant and still there is the cynical mockery in his eyes.
Of course there is, Fenella.
Would you have me cowed and obedient to Ireland's greatest enemy…?
Behind her, the other treadmills still turned and clanked and the captive creatures trudged ever on and on, ever forward.
Fenella looked over her shoulder at them and saw that they were looking at her with such blind trust and with such faith that cold anger rose in her at the evil Lord who had forced them to his work.
I don't think I shall bear it if this does not work, thought Fenella.
I don't know how we shall get them out, because they are exhausted and probably they will find it difficult to walk.
But somehow we have to do it.
She looked back at Nuadu and knew that it had to work.
If I have to tear open the cages with my hands, I shall rescue him.
I shall rescue all of them!
He caught that at once and his eyes above the mask glittered.
Well, Fenella?
Use the spell.
Or are we to stand here all day?
Caged and muzzled, but as arrogant, as imperious, as he always was and always will be…
Fenella fastened the garment about her waist, by no means sure that this would be sufficient, expecting it to feel uncomfortable and even grisly.
But it was neither of these things.
It moulded itself about her waist and it felt warm and rather safe, as if it might be armouring her against the evils in here.
She sent a glance to the corners where the shadows still lay, thick and clotted and sinister, but nothing moved.
Fenella turned back to the treadmills and half closed her eyes, the words of the Robemaker still clear in her mind.

MOLOCH
‘And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.’
Genesis, chapter 28, verse 12
Jesus Garcia de Soto y Delporto stared through the transparent Lift wall with a puzzled expression.
His face cloud; first with alarm and then fear.
The stars were moving.
Even as he shouted for attention, Jesus had picked a target star and was tracking its apparent movement around the Lift.
Within seconds, it was halfway between him and the place where the other five members of B shift were grouped together, discussing procedure and checking through stacks of domestic stores for Moloch Base.
Jesus pushed himself off and floated rapidly around the Lift, bringing himself expertly to a stop less than a metre from the slight form of Christine LaFayette.
‘Christine,’ he said urgently, ‘get everyone into their spacesuits.’
‘What?’
‘For God's sake, do it now!
The Lift is spinning.’
‘He's right, get moving!’
That was the newcomer.
Ace?
Was that her name?
She seemed to have a sensible head on her shoulders.
While the others stood and gawped, she had already pushed herself over to the storage lockers and was busy tossing the flimsy emergency spacesuits over.
Jesus caught one and popped the seals.
‘All right, move it!’
Christine shouted.
‘I don't know how strong the Bridge is, but it can't be designed to absorb this much stress.’
‘How far have we turned?’
Ace asked.
‘Thirty degrees at a guess, but fast; my reference star  has already gone behind the filament engagement assembly.’
‘The what?’
He pointed to the central area of the torus, where the otherwise transparent wall was a translucent pink.
‘The area where the Bridge passes through the Lift.’
Over on one side, Lars Ulrich blinked his fashionably painted eyelids whilst he calculated moments of inertia and angular velocities on the wax tablet he always carried with him.
‘Thirty degrees of rotation in — one minute, you say?
Is angular velocity of….’
The tall mathematician's thin face creased with surprise.
‘Hell on ice, we should be flying through walls by now.’
‘Suit up first.
Talk later.’
That was Ace again.
She certainly didn't waste words.
Even though she'd stopped to hand out the suits, she was still first into hers.
‘Somebody check me.’
Jesus inspected her seals.
‘Tight.’
Ace checked his in turn and then moved on to the other team members.
‘Okay.
Jesus, you'll do.
Lars, fine.
Christine, check your left elbow seal.
Kosi, Yukio, you're both okay.
Right everyone; latch your helmets back and don't switch to internal power until you have to.
We're still spinning, but the integrity of the Lift seems to be intact for the moment.
Jesus, how far round are we?’
‘Coming up on one full revolution, Ace.
No sign of slowing, either.’
‘Right.
You've got observation duty.
Sing out every revolution.
Yukio, alert Belial Base of our situation.
Christine — how much do you know about the Bridge?
Can you estimate how many turns it could take before it snaps?’
As Yukio Nakaguchi murmured in the background, Christine said, ‘Ace, I'm sorry, I don't know.
Tech studies aren't my speciality.
I'm a psychologist.’
‘Fine.
Is there anyone here from Technical?’
Kosiana Kistasami nodded inside her suit.
A fringe of hair plaited with tiny Belial clay beads bobbed gently in the reduced gravity, obscuring her dark skin and brooding  eyes.
‘The problem is, Ace, that nobody really knows.
We've spent years examining the Bridge systems, but for all the good it's done us we might have been blowing bubbles.
We do know the Bridge is made from an extruded monofilament of trisilicate which has been woven into a tube, but as to its strength — well, theoretically it shouldn't even exist.
It should have collapsed under its own weight before it was even anchored.’
Ace frowned.
‘So much for Technical.’
She seemed to be lost in memories of her own for a moment.
‘Second revolution starting now.’
The Lift shuddered.
‘Helmets down.’
There were five clicks followed by the rising hum of internal systems powering up.
‘Um….
I think I, may have a problem here,’ Yukio said with a panicky laugh.
Jesus realized Yukio's problem straight away.
Rebelling against the bland uniformity of the base, and to the amusement of many of his colleagues, Yukio had grown a bushy, spade-shaped beard in emulation of his cricketing hero, W. G. Grace.
And he couldn't close his helmet over it.
Ace said without a pause, ‘Christine, help Yukio get his helmet latched.
Kosi, Lars, go round the Lift.
Check the integrity.
Take stress meters with you.
Don't dawdle — but I want a thorough check.’
‘Third revolution starting now,’ Jesus chipped in as the technicians moved to obey Ace's instruction.
He felt his heart thumping inside his chest.
How could Ace stay so calm?
As far as he knew, she had received no training for this type of situation.
Nonetheless, she seemed to be coping with it the best of all of them.
as cold as ice-water.
‘Any sign of slowing yet?’
‘Sorry, no.’
Jesus could hear faint noises through his spacesuit's external pickups.
The structure of the Lift was creaking and the Bridge twanged like an overstretched wire.
‘Ace!
We have trouble now!’
That was Lars, his accent thickening with the fear which now drove them all.
Ace was already moving in his direction.
Jesus blinked and recovered the target star.
No — it was….
Damn.
Where the hell was it?
Lucifer's atmospheric corona was blotting out the stars again, and voices were babbling in his ears.
‘— this is really embarrassing —’
‘— just latch your helmet, Yukio.
Everything'll be fine as long as you just —’
‘— I'm getting a stress factor you wouldn't believe, here.
The internal wall.
The external wall.
Everydamnwhere —’
‘— you check again, is good idea.
Perhaps the meters, they lose calibration —’
‘— it's the damn wall we're losing —’
‘— I want everyone in the centre of the chamber —’
‘— fiddling with my helmet!
I'm sure if I just —’
’— we're losing it, we're definitely —’
’— I think I've got it.
I think I can —’
Jesus didn't have time to blink.
The wall tore open, rips spreading around the torus as the air rushed outwards.
Yukio gave a choking scream as the pressure within his suit forced his helmet back up over the latches.
The scream didn't last long in the newly formed vacuum.
Christine gave a yell of surprise as a spray of blood erupted from Yukio's eyes, ears and mouth.
Crystallizing in the sudden deadly cold, it engulfed her helmet in a spray of pink ice.
She staggered backwards, straight into the whipsawing edge of the monofilament shield, gasping with surprise and pain when the molecule-thin blade sliced through the toughened material of her spacesuit, neatly removing the arm she had automatically put out to protect herself.
The arm drifted free, trailing ribbons of freezing blood and sinew.
The sudden vacuum pulled Jesus towards the ragged-edged hole and expelled him along with a mess of loose trash, a hailstorm of frozen blood and Christine's arm.
He was tumbling so fast that the stars became blurred circles of light around him.
A lump of frozen vapour and blood bumped momentarily against his visor before drifting off into the darkness.
He recognized the spade-shaped mass of black hair projecting from the lump and began to scream.
‘Jesus, shut up!
I know you're drifting.
You'll be okay.
I need to think.’
‘Christ, what about Yukio?
And Christine….
Her arm —’
‘Forget about Yukio.
And don't worry about Christine.
Just get yourself under control and get back here now.’
Jesus took a deep breath.
He felt like he was going to be sick.
He chinned a switch and felt the autodoc press a needle pad against his neck.
His stomach settled immediately.
‘On my way.’
‘Wicked.
See you in a minute.’
Jesus chinned in the onboard systems.
‘Spacesuit twelve: activate memory guidance.
Return to source using minimum fuel trajectory.’
There was a momentary hesitation before the spacesuit confirmed his instruction.
A gentle pressure in the small of his back told him that the thruster pack had fired.
The stars began to slow from their wild dervish dance to a stately waltz.
Then he was facing the Bridge.
‘Ace, are you reading me?’
‘Loud and clear.
Turn your gain down a bit— or stop shouting.’
Jesus adjusted a control.
‘I can see both ways along the Bridge.’
‘What's the damage?’
‘Difficult to tell.
Both ends appear to be fixed, but it's vibrating like a violin string.’
‘How bad?’
‘Ace, I'm half a kilometre away.
If I can see the movement, it's got to be bad, right?’
Ace swore.
‘And that's not all,’ he added.
‘It looks from here like there are some frayed areas on the Bridge where fragments  from the Lift sliced across it.
They could rip at any time.
The Bridge could unravel like an old pullover.’
Ace swore again.
Jesus wondered where she'd learned words like that.
‘Can you see the Lift?’ she said eventually.
His gaze travelled along the length of the Bridge.
The Lift was a small doughnut with the Bridge threading through the hole.
A cloud of debris surrounded it.
‘Looks okay.
You're tilted slightly, and spinning, but you're still attached.
How's everyone there?
Is Christine —?’
‘No.
The suit sealed off her arm.
She lost a fair bit of blood, but the autodoc is medicating her now.
If we're lucky, she'll make it.’
‘Yukio wasn't lucky, was he?’
‘Yukio was a bloody idiot.’
‘Christ, what a mess.
What do you think happened?’
‘How the hell do I know?
Now get a move on.
We still don't know if it's over yet.’
‘Right.’
It would take several minutes at least to get back to the Bridge.
With nothing to do in the meantime, Jesus tried to maintain a rational equilibrium by observing his surroundings.
The observations might come in useful later.
If there was a later.
Below the rotating Lift, the hot glare of Lucifer's atmosphere, backlit by the sun, formed a corona around the lower moon.
According to Tiw, the journey down to Moloch should have taken slightly less than two hours.
During the course of that time, the light from Lucifer's atmosphere would have grown in strength until it blotted out the stars and enveloped both Bridge and Lift in a flaming glare.
Then they would have entered the conical shadow cast by the moon, and the stars would have become visible again for a brief time before the Lift sank beneath the surface itself and came to a standstill, its massive kinetic energy somehow conducted away from the lower terminus and stored in a way that  Alex Bannen would have killed to learn.
A beep somewhere behind his head told Jesus that he was nearing the Bridge.
Twenty-five metres away, he disengaged the autoreturn sequence and navigated himself to a point level with the outside rim of the rotating Lift.
The jagged hole through which he'd been propelled some minutes before now rushed past his face once every minute or so.
The ragged edges of the hole glinted sharply, and Jesus knew that any failed attempt to enter the Lift would be likely to result in his being sliced to ribbons within a matter of seconds.
He had neither the fuel nor the skill to match the rotational speed of the vehicle.
Yet what other choices did he have?
He called Ace and explained the situation.
‘I'm not a spaceman, Ace.
Got any ideas?’
He could see a figure within the Lift detach itself from the group and glance quickly in his direction.
‘Yeah.
The Lift's wide, so the angular velocity is higher on the outside.
Jet up over the top and attach your safety line to the Bridge, then abseil across the top of the Lift when you've matched spin.
When you get to the hole, we'll grab you and haul you in.’
‘Won't work, Ace.
The Bridge is smooth, nothing to attach to.
And it's too wide to loop the line around; I won't have enough slack left to lower myself to the hole.’
Jesus sucked in a deep breath.
‘There's only one thing for it.
I'm just going to have to try a perpendicular approach and hope I can time my arrival to a point when the hole is passing in front of me.’
A new voice said, ‘You could try an approach tangential to the curve of the Lift.
That way it might be easier to match relative velocities for a few seconds.
Thing is, if you miss….’
‘I risk drifting off into space.
Thanks Kosi.
I'll stick with the perpendicular approach.’
Ace spoke again.
‘All right.
Give us a moment to clear a space for you and then pick your own time.
We'll keep our fingers crossed.’
‘Thanks.’
‘See you in a minute.’
I hope so.
Jesus quickly gave the suit what he hoped were precise instructions, waiting until he was sure of the hole's period of rotation before whispering, ‘Activate command sequence….
Now.’
There was a familiar pressure on his back.
The Lift began to speed towards him until he was only twenty metres away.
Fifteen.
The hole vanished around the arc of the vehicle.
Ten metres.
Five.
The wall was rushing by in front of him now, glassy and smooth, offering no grip should he miss his intended target.
Four metres.
The hole was nowhere in — wait a minute!
There it was!
Jesus grimaced.
The hole was moving too slowly.
He wasn't going to make it.
Three metres.
Two metres.
‘Sorry Ace.
I don't think I'm going to…’
There was a sudden bang as he crashed against the Lift, and a scraping sensation as he began to roll along the surface.
Billowing sheets of material ballooned out to meet him: the edges of the hole, deceptively soft looking but with lethal edges.
The Lift spun beneath him like a sickening carousel ride.
The red glare from Lucifer seemed to engulf him, and the combined effects of yaw and pitch on his inner ear overcame the antinausea medication.
When he had finished vomiting, Jesus realized there was a firm pressure on his arms and legs.
Ace, Kosi and Lars were holding him down.
‘I reckon we can let him go now.
How do you feel?’
Ace asked.
‘Embarrassed.
And sticky.’
Lars and Kosi laughed.
Ace did not.
Jesus sat up.
The interior of the Lift, even in this  wrecked condition, had never looked so good.
‘Thought was a goner.
How'd I get in here?’
Lars pointed down at Jesus's legs.
He followed the mathematician's gesture and saw that his legs were completely tangled in a flapping web of cloth.
‘Ace, she breaks open one of the store's canisters.
It is full of bedsheets, yes?
She makes net, reels you in like big fish.’
He glanced sideways at Ace.
‘That is right?
You say fish, yes?’
Jesus shook his head in amazement.
‘But what about he monofilament I saw?
Surely it would have torn the sheets to pieces, synthetic or otherwise?’
‘Naw.
Kosi here showed us how to grab the edges of the hole with equipment clamps and fold them so the material wasn't dangerous.
What you saw wasn't the monofilament, it was the sheets.’
Jesus smiled gratefully.
‘You managed to organize all this in the few minutes I was out there?
I'm impressed.’
‘Minutes?’
Ace laughed outright.
‘You were out there over an hour, mate.
We thought you'd got bored with our company.’
Jesus shook his head tiredly.
As the others began to discuss survival options, Jesus found his mind drifting.
Adrenalin withdrawal made him introspective and sleepy.
He turned over and tried to relax, but found himself looking downward through the metal grille which the Eden team had welded across the curved Lift surfaces as a floor, wondering what kind of anatomy would have been suited to use the original surface.
It was crazy.
There were no constants.
Or rather, he only constant was…well,change .
Jesus shook his head.
The aliens, whoever they'd been, were dead and gone, a million years or more.
They were history, and he doubted he would ever truly know them.
The thought saddened him.
They must have been such wonderful beings, and now even the legacy of their environment was being rewritten by the humans, changed with every curved floor covered by a flat grille, every piece of art ripped from the walls and studied out of context, every subtle  nuance of space filled with metal and plastic, neural net cabinets, stores, machinery, even people.
Jesus felt a gentle sense of irony steal over him.
They'd come here to learn, but it seemed all they would ever learn was how to alter that which they had no possibility of understanding into something so familiar there was no point in their understanding it.
A familiar voice came over the suit's comm-system.
‘Feel cold.
Arm hurts.’
Ace said, ‘I know, Christine.’
She switched channels and continued, ‘Lars, could you administer another tranquillizer for me?’
‘No problem.’
The mathematician propelled himself towards the prone figure some yards away.
Ace turned her attention to Jesus.
‘I've tried to communicate with Belial Base.
I don't know whether they're receiving or not, but I'm getting nothing back.
We're on our own.
Both Kosi and Lars figure that we're a lot closer to Moloch than to Belial, but we're going to have to get there under our own steam.
You're the environment specialist.
I need an idea from you.
One that'll save our lives.
You up for it, or what?’
Jesus began to untangle his legs.
His mind was whirling.
Ace was right.
They had to do something, but what?
If they stayed where they were they were dead for certain.
Before he could reply, Lars called for attention and he followed Ace and Kosi across to Christine's recumbent body.
Lars was kneeling beside her, cradling the psychologist's truncated left arm in his suit gauntlets.
He lifted up his hand.
Tiny ruby globules were frozen to it.
Blood.
‘Her suit integrity is breached, Ace.
A slow leak, but the pressure, it drops.
She could lose the rest of her arm.’
‘I told her to check that seal.’
Ace sounded furious.
‘You also told her to help Yukio, if I recall.’
Ace nodded guiltily.
‘Kosi, you're right.
It's my fault.
I should have checked her suit again.
Damn!’
She thought for a moment.
‘See if you can patch it, Lars.’
Ace turned to Jesus.
‘Got anything for me yet?’
‘I've got one idea, but you're not going to like it.’
Inside her helmet, Ace's head tilted curiously.
‘We go down the inside of the Bridge,’ he continued.
‘You're right, I don't like it.
How do we get in?’
‘The Bridge is woven from a monofilament thread.
All we have to do is force the weave apart.’
‘And how do we get out when we reach Moloch?’
Jesus shrugged.
‘I've no idea.’
Ace considered.
‘It's got to be better than trying to abseil down the outside.
Okay.
We'll go for it.
Let's see if we can widen the hole enough to get Christine through.’
It took thirty minutes for them to locate a frayed section of the Bridge; force its weave apart with clamps and keep the gap open with plastic crates.
The Lift continued to oscillate as it rotated, swaying with the movement of the Bridge.
Jesus stared around the chamber.
Building up to the big one, he thought.
He was developing a peculiar feeling in the pit of his stomach; a feeling beyond sickness, beyond shock.
Ace would have known the feeling.
It was called determination.
When the hole was big enough, Jesus stepped through and switched on his spacesuit lights.
The interior space was about three metres across, a pastel yellow in colour, tubular and bulked out with strange-looking machinery which was attached to the crosshatched ‘walls’.
Jesus shone his light ‘down’ the shaft, thankful, for once, for the lack of gravity.
His light glinted on a surface that swayed and twisted sickeningly into the distance.
It was like looking down the eye of a hurricane.
‘How's it look?’
‘Like something out of The Wizard of Oz .’
‘What?’
‘I said —’
There was a particularly violent jolt.
More pieces of the machinery began to break away to join the expanding cloud of trash already in evidence inside the Bridge.
A chunk of blood drifted in front of his visor.
He batted it  away impatiently, not even pausing to consider how quickly he'd adjusted to Yukio's death.
‘I said it's looking better every minute.’
‘I hope you're right.’
Lars and Kosi carefully manoeuvred Christine through the gap.
Ace followed them in.
‘Don't suppose you ever heard a story called Jack and the Beanstalk ?’
‘This would be soyabeans, yes?’
Ace sighed.
‘Forget it.’
In complete silence, the interior of the Bridge began to rock again.
He gripped the side of a curved triangular plate which was fitted to the wall, and began to manoeuvre himself further into the shaft.
One corner came loose in his hands.
‘Don't rush me.
I think I can see electrical equipment in here, bigger than anything I've ever seen before.
We're going to have to be careful.’
‘We haven't got time to be careful.’
Ace squeezed past Kosi and Lars.
‘Give Christine to me and follow me down.’
Ace took the psychologist from her two bearers and clamped her suit arms to the unconscious woman's shoulders.
Then she took a quick sighting down the shaft and launched herself into space.
Her lights dwindled rapidly in the distance.
‘Ace, be careful!’ he said.
Was there a measure of excitement in her reply?
‘Careful or dead, at least it's my choice!’
Kosi and Lars exchanged brief looks and then launched themselves after the girl.
Jesus shrugged.
It was one way of getting down, he supposed.
He was about to push off when the Bridge rocked again; a much stronger oscillation this time.
He thrust his helmet back through the gap one last time.
The Lift was finally coming apart in curlicues of alien material and clouds of human-made debris.
There would be a brief but spectacular meteor shower in Lucifer's upper atmosphere tonight, he thought, wondering if those on  Belial would watch and think of them, as he had thought of Paula Engado when she'd become a shooting star.
As the walls of the Bridge rippled, he pulled himself back inside.
‘Instruction,’ he said to the suitbrain, ‘forward thrust full.’
The head-up display died.
‘Instruction —’ he said again, but it was too late.
The walls closed on him like a vice.
Jesus screamed with pain and surprise.
His limbs bent and snapped, his helmet cracked open and there was a stinging pain in his eyes.
He tried to close them but the eyelids were frozen in place, unable to move.
They were still open when he died.
Alex Bannen was crying.
Piper had never seen him look so vulnerable.
His cheeks glistened with tears and his hand hovered over the head of the thing he had called his son.
Behind him the Mushroom Farm was ablaze.
Great arcs of energy flashed from cap to cap whilst thunderclaps pumped air through the forest of glittering stems.
A haze of water vapour hung overhead and dripped from the underside of the mushrooms, making the ground slippery and treacherous to walk on.
Piper had to fight to maintain her balance as the chamber shook.
The Doctor and Bernice were stumbling between the mushrooms of twisted metal, with the Doctor talking nineteen to the dozen and gesturing wildly with his still furled umbrella.
Piper managed to catch Bernice's eye, but the archaeologist only shrugged helplessly.
Piper turned to where Bannen was clutching the slender trunk of a tall mushroom to keep his balance.
The wind whipped droplets of condensation into his face, where they mingled with his tears.
Bloody idiot, she thought savagely.
What the hell did he think he was doing?
‘Come on, Alex.
Stop messing with things you don't understand.
Leave that to the Doctor before you screw things up even….’
Her voice trailed off as she noticed the boy watching her with grey, expressionless eyes.
Bannen's son?
Perhaps, but it hadn't taken her long to work out what the boy really was.
‘It wasn't meant to be like this.’
Bannen's face was slack.
‘Yeah, well, that's as may be,’ she said, unsure how to treat this new, defenceless Bannen.
‘Come on, let's go.’
There was a slight cough beside them.
Piper turned, and found the Doctor standing at her shoulder.
She hadn't heard him approach.
From the expression on Bannen's face, neither had he.
The Doctor began to speak, in a voice so quiet Piper wondered how she could hear his words above the storm.
‘A great many years from now, in another universe, a man in a mirror told me to do nothing.
‘It is done,’ he said.’
Piper suddenly had the crazy idea that all the Doctor's masks had been stripped away, leaving him with no more armour than the truth.
She shivered.
‘It's very hard for me to do nothing,’ he added softly.
‘I — rebel against it.
But there are times when nothing is simply the best thing to do.’
‘What does he mean, Dad?’
Bannen didn't seem to hear the voice of his ‘son’.
The Doctor glanced at the simularity.
He crouched down so that his head was level with the boy's face, and smiled reassuringly.
He seemed to have no trouble in accepting the presence of the child.
‘My friend Bernice and I have been trying to work out how to stabilize the moons,’ he said.
‘This room is obviously the key element in an important system of controls.
The controls were disturbed, and now we have to put them right.’
‘Or your other friends will die.’
The Doctor nodded solemnly.
The boy turned to his ‘father’.
‘Dad.
Dad!’
Bannen did not respond.
Piper scowled.
‘It's useless.
If Christine had used her eyes and spotted Bannen's instability she could've prevented all this.
He's good for nothing but trouble now.’
She looked at the Doctor, but he appeared not to be listening.
‘Perhaps nothing is all we need from him, or from anyone,’ he said at last, and smiled triumphantly.
‘Do what?’
Piper said.
‘Feedback!
The ability of a system to monitor its output and correct for mistakes.
That's what I'm waiting for.’
‘You think,’ said a hesitant voice, ‘that everything might be all right?’
The Doctor turned to where Alex Bannen was crouching and looking over at them.
‘No,’ he said sternly.
‘Entropy demands that everything will not be all right, but sometimes we can rage against the dying of the light.’
A sudden, eerie flash illuminated the cavern.
The pillar that marked where the Pit passed through the Farm had begun to glow.
Bands of yellow light rose and fell across its surface; diaphanous spokes rotating about rose-hued hubs intermeshed with each other, beautiful reflections of a deeper order within.
A deep chime filled the chamber with rolling echoes.
‘It is done,’ the Doctor whispered.
Piper drew in a relieved breath as the wind fell.
The deep rumbling beneath their feet abruptly stopped, and the electrical discharges faded away.
The blanket of fog above their heads began to disperse, sparkling the mushroom-shaped domes with soft diamonds of moisture.
In the upper part of the chamber, a rainbow glimmered.
From Bishop's ship, moored close to the Bridge, the scale of the disaster was apparent.
The Adjudicator had discarded his heavy black robes and ridiculous collar, and was slumped in his padded control seat wearing just boxer shorts, socks and electrostatic sock-suspenders.
His feet were resting comfortably on the ship's control panel.
As he watched the events occurring between the two moons, he blew on a plastic beaker of fragrant Arcturan tea.
Ripples were travelling up and down the Bridge, but the anchors remained firm.
The amplitude of the vibration even seemed to be reducing slightly, although the movement was still sickeningly massive.
Staring for too long at the simularity made him feel dizzy.
He tried a sip of tea and winced as the hot liquid scalded his tongue.
Somewhere up there the Lift was disintegrating.
Bishop was glad it was too small to see: it made suppressing the imagined screams of the people inside that much easier.
The ship's neural net interrupted his second sip of tea.
‘You have a call, Trau Bishop.’
Muttering darkly beneath his breath, Bishop set down the beaker and dived for his robes.
He wondered who was calling — Miles, perhaps, or that little clown the Doctor.
They had already tried to get him to mount a rescue mission using his ship.
He had explained that the amount of paperwork involved made it impracticable, but he was sure they hadn't believed him.
When the picture of the Bridge disintegrated to reveal the stern visage of Bronwen ap Bryn, Adjudicator in Extremis, he was shocked.
The last he had heard she had returned to Ponten VI — the planet which had been ceded to the Guild of Adjudicators in perpetuity by a wary but appreciative Earth Central — but that was too far away for anything but the so-called pigeon post; recorded messages dumped into a hyperdrone and aimed at the recipient's projected location.
If Bryn was calling ‘live’, she had to be nearby.
Even so, the tachyon signal was so faint that the neural net was having problems extrapolating a recognizable picture.
The face of the Adjudicator in Extremis seemed to be composed of flat green slabs.
Fuzzy highlights delineated her features and her mouth lagged behind her words.
Superimposed upon her face, flickering digits recorded the cost of the call.
Typically, that part of the transmission seemed unaffected by the disruption.
Bryn's mouth worked silently.
More than a second out of synch, a blast of static shot through the protesting audio system.
Bishop winced.
‘Your pardon, Extremis.
I was not expecting a personal visit.’
‘I'll not…sagree w…at.
I was in…vicinity on…cial business and….
Your repor…o far is…nconclusive.’
‘There have been some — some additional problems.’
A flexing of the green planes making up Bryn's face could have been interpreted as a smile.
Or a frown.
With her, the two were practically interchangeable.
‘Problems are your job, Adjudicator.’
Funny how the software let that one through unaffected.
‘Flattered as I am by your confidence, Extremis, I'm afraid the situation is getting complicated.’
The green slab representing Bryn's left eyebrow slipped upwards questioningly.
Or perhaps it was a system glitch.
Bishop hesitated before going on.
‘There has been another death — an apparent suicide — and indications of sabotage on a grand scale.
Additionally, there are discrepancies in the Base personnel records, involving three extra people.’
‘…tra peop ….’
Bishop took a deep breath.
‘I feel that the proceedings here may escalate seriously if a careful check is not kept on the situation.
For this reason, I would like to request the presence of another Adjudicator.’
Bryn's mouth worked silently for a few seconds.
‘…te out of…e questio…m afraid.’
‘But why?’
‘You a…ware of…e galact…ituation?’
‘The planetary attacks?
I thought they were isolated incidents.’
Perhaps through some fluke in the software, perhaps because of some local fluctuation in signal strength, the face of the Adjudicator in Extremis suddenly ballooned out to its full, impressive girth.
Her voice regained its usual baritone boom.
‘We have lost fifteen colony worlds in three weeks, Adjudicator.
Azure, Qartopholos, Sifranos — ecologies devastated, entire populations wiped out — and we have absolutely no idea who's responsible!
The Interstellar Taskforce is on continual stand-by alert.
I am on a,’ her pause was not due to a transmission fault, ‘fact-finding tour of the outlying regions, and took the opportunity to contact you directly.
All currently  unassigned Adjudicators are working full-time following up leads, but frankly, the Guild does not look even remotely good.
Besides,’ her pudgy eyes suddenly narrowed and she ran a hand across her tattooed scalp, ‘there are moves afoot which I am not at liberty to discuss.
You may be receiving help soon from an unexpected source.’
‘But Extremis, if you would only see the logic —’
‘Adjudicator Bishop, I need hardly remind you that so far your case list borders upon the ludicrous: one accident, possibly murder; one suicide, possibly murder; one disaster, possibly mass murder.
No evidence and a baseful of suspects.
This is how careers end, Adjudicator: not with a bang, but with a whimper.’
‘But —’
Bryn's face bulged and seethed in unlikely places as the signal began to corrupt again.
Her eyes flickered sideways to read the digital cost display’…. m afraid your budget…an no longer.
…ustain the price of…is transmission,’ the Extremis said.
‘…uggest you…eep a tight watch on furth…penditure.’
The picture flickered back into sync one more time before fading.
‘I also recommend you wear your robes the right way round, Adjudicator; it's so much better for public relations.’
The transmission faded and he frowned, casting his mind back over the conversation.
How did she know that people had died on the Bridge? he wondered.
All I did was mention sabotage.
as if he didn't have enough to worry about.
He sighed in frustration and reached for his tea.
It was cold.
It was cold in the crew room on Moloch Base.
Jesus Delporto's dying scream had followed Ace all the way to the lower moon, down the violently oscillating length of the Bridge, past bizarre machinery which seethed with naked power, and through the gap she had torched in the base of the column; it followed her as eager hands pulled her from the writhing Bridge, stripped away her suit and placed her with the others in the medical  unit; followed her into sleep, forced a path into her dreams, drove her screaming and unrested into wakefulness.
One more failure on her part; one more life lost; one more friend pulled away by the black tide.
She tried to use Spacefleet hypno-techniques to block the remorse, but either they weren't that good or she hadn't learned them well enough.
Ace glared at her face in the mirror.
She poked a finger into the luggage beneath her eyes, stretching the skin, trying to make it look young again.
All her life she'd striven to be older, more mature, to experience more of what the universe had to offer.
Now, here she was, with her life's dream in the palm of her hand, trying to turn back the clock.
She shook her head as a short, unexpectedly bitter laugh bubbled up from her chest.
She stifled the sound as the crew room door opened and Kosi walked in.
Her hand hesitated by Ace's shoulder.
Ace was thankful the touch was not completed.
She felt vulnerable enough already.
‘Come back to the operations room, Ace.
Get your mind off it, all right?’
‘Yeah, right.’
Ace followed Kosi from the room.
‘Ta.’
The Ops Room on the lower moon was a twin to Belial's; a spacious, split-level hemisphere with a profusion of glimmering instrumentation, manned by serious-looking technicians, surrounding the towering bulk of a MultiCray Neural Net.
Floor to ceiling simularity windows displayed the incredible landscape beyond the base, giving Ace the impression that the Operations Room was actually outdoors.
Only the absence of wind marred the illusion.
She exchanged a few words with the shift supervisor, a dour Scot named Rachel McBride, and was told a message had been sent to Belial confirming their arrival and condition.
Ace thanked the woman and then moved restlessly across to the windows, drawn by the view.
Whereas Belial Base had been built on the outer surface of a solid moon, Moloch Base was inside a hollow one; a miracle of planetary engineering which, after five years, still had Bannen and his team groping in the dark for answers to questions they didn't even know how to formulate.
The ground of this bizarre world rose gradually in all directions, curving overhead until it was lost above the clouds.
Vegetation ran riot.
Duty teams maintained a neat lawn surrounding the base but, beyond the perimeter, a lush pink jungle rose in fantastic profusion towards the flat glare of a pale, artificial ‘sun’ whose energy was provided by the same mysterious means as powered the Bridge and the Lift.
Translucent shapes undulated through the jungle, glimmering in the sunlight: the only life the Lucifer System had so far offered up for study.
Ace felt her pulse racing at the sight.
She grinned: all the shit in the world could not blow away the simple wonder of this pastoral scene.
‘Horrible, isn't it?’
Kosi had moved up beside her after checking in with the duty manager.
‘All that space.’
Ace turned in surprise.
‘You're not agoraphobic are you?’
‘So what if I am?’
Kosi replied a little defensively.
‘All that open ground.
No factories.
No living towers.
And those horrible white things floating up there, just waiting to fall down and smother us.
Ugh!’
Kosi shivered, seemingly unable to understand why Ace giggled softly.
‘I can't understand you people,’ Ace confided.
‘All this space-cadet, sense-of-wonder stuff, and you're happier with four blank walls around you.’
‘You forget,’ said a voice behind her.
‘We have been here for five years.
Our sense of wonder has passed.
Our sense of boredom has set in — with a vengeance.’
Lars Ulrich smiled as Ace turned, and continued, ‘Christine will be fine.
Minus an arm, but fine.
There is no infection.
Space, it may be cold, but it is clean, at least.’
It's not space you've got to worry about, Ace thought, it's the people in it.
She said nothing, but instead left the two young people by the window and moved back to the duty manager's desk.
‘I just wanted to say thanks for pulling us out of there.’
‘No problem.’
Rachel McBride smiled.
‘Alex Bannen would've had a screaming fit if we'd left you to mess up his precious Bridge; God alone knows what Tiw would've done.’
‘Given you a lecture on the sound of one hand clapping, I expect.’
‘Aye — clapping against the side of my head, I've no doubt!’
Both women laughed.
McBride had a pretty laugh, Ace noticed.
A laugh it felt good to join in with.
‘Have they told you what goes on down here, then?’
Ace shook her head.
‘Nope.’
McBride shrugged.
‘There's the brass for you.’
She called to a white-haired technician, ‘Chas, do us a favour will you?
Keep an eye on this lot and shout if anything weird pops up.’
She turned back to Ace.
‘Come on then.
I'll give you the tour.’
‘Oh,’ she said, as she led the way from the room, ‘I've been meaning to ask you.
What happened to Sam Russell?
He was supposed to be down here on the second part of a double shift.
When he didn't turn up, I assumed he'd overslept, but when he didn't radio through to apologize….’
Kosi and Lars turned from the window to watch Ace and McBride leave the Operations Room.
‘What do you reckon, then?
Ace?
She's fine, I reckon.’
‘That's not what I meant.’
‘You ask odd question.
Ace, she saves Christine's life.
Would have saved Yukio and Jesus too if not for bad luck.’
‘Yeah, I know.
But she makes me uneasy.
She always looks….
I dunno, ready for a fight.’
Lars tapped his fingers reflexively against his wax tablet, a sure sign he was thinking carefully about what Kosi had said.
‘I think you make big refinery out of small process.
Ace, she's fine.
Fine person.’
‘Then how come when we pulled her from her suit I  found a folder full of Alex Bannen's notes stashed away inside the sleeve?’
The Atmospheric Vehicle Research Laboratory was a large, irregular enclosure filled with machinery of human design.
In the centre of the room a large, asymmetric pod was suspended over an engineering pit.
The pod was four metres in height, with a single hatch and an exoskeleton which supported various instrument modules and waldo limbs.
Ace touched the gleaming metal sides of the starpod.
White alloy, highly polished, threw back the glare of multiple floodlights into her narrowed eyes.
‘So this was what Paula was working on.
An excursion module.’
McBride nodded.
‘The girl was positive she could contact the Angels if only she could get deep enough into Lucifer's atmosphere.
The ordinary starsuits are pretty handy bits of gear, especially compared with the emergency spacesuits you used in the Lift, but the pod was designed to go deeper still.
Thousands of kilometres, in fact.
God only knows why she didn't wait until it was ready, rather than rely on a starsuit.’
Ace ran a finger lightly across the saddle for the instrument packs.
‘Thousands?
Just how deep is the atmosphere, anyway?’
McBride shrugged.
She walked across the semicircular pod bay towards the monitor station, sealed behind a transparent partition.
‘Actually, it's difficult to say.
Deep down the heat and pressure are so great that even hydrogen is a metallic liquid.’
Ace followed McBride into the monitor station.
‘So it's hard to tell where the atmosphere ends and the planet itself begins.’
McBride nodded.
‘Hence the size of the instrument array.
There's an ocean of liquid zelanite alloy down there, you know, floating in the sky: big as a normal planet.’
McBride shook her head.
‘The damn thing's a bag of mysteries and no mistake.’
Ace skipped her fingers lightly across the tops of the consoles.
She could see from the screen displays how the systems were designed to function.
‘Nice system.
Did Paula design it herself?’
‘She specified the high-level design.
Yukio wrote the software.’
‘And now he's dead.’
Ace frowned.
‘Just like Paula.’
‘You have a theory?’
‘Naw, not really.
It's just — well, it's just that if whatever killed Paula was a software virus rather than an accident, then someone would have had to infect the suitbrain.
That would implicate one of the system engineers — someone like Yukio.
The incident on the Bridge might have been a clumsy attempt by a third party to bump off the middle man.’
‘Unless the same virus which attacked Paula's starsuit attacked Belial's neural net as well.’
‘You're forgetting — the Bridge functions are not controlled by human technology.
The original, alien systems whatever that might be, is still running them.’
McBride huffed softly in acquiescence.
‘Ever thought about becoming an Adjudicator?’
Ace grinned.
‘I'd look like the flying nun.’
She studied the rest of the monitor station.
The back wall was lined with storage cabinets.
‘What's in there?’ she asked.
‘Paula's research files.
Simularities, mainly.
Oh, and her diary as well.
Why, do you want to take a look?’
‘Do I ever.’
Ace opened the first cabinet, scanned the hundred or so labels quickly, selected the most recent crystal and fed it into a reader.
She blinked her contact lenses into place and began to watch the file.
‘I think you might want to check this out,’ Chas said.
Kosi left her plastic beaker of tea steaming gently on the nearest flat surface while she and Lars headed for the centre of the room.
The elderly Chas Varley was peering in some confusion at an arc of screens which pulsed with read-outs and rippling waveforms.
‘What's up?’ she asked.
‘You tell me, lass.’
Chas fine-tuned a few controls.
‘I've never seen anything remotely like it.’
‘Is software virus, maybe?’
Lars asked.
‘Yeah,’ Kosi said, ‘there seems to be a lot of it going around.’
Chas shook his head.
‘No, look.
It's a steady pattern.
Not one of Lucifer's though.’
Kosi thought for a moment.
‘Could it be the Angels, trying to talk to us at last?’
Before Chas could reply, Ace burst in from the main access corridor.
McBride followed more slowly, wearing a worried frown.
‘Oh, Rachel, I was just about to call you,’ Chas said.
‘The fifty-metre array is picking up an odd waveform.
I've run a library comparison but none of the eigenvalues match with anything we've seen before.
Do you recognize it?’
Before Rachel could reply, Ace walked quickly past them to the communications terminal.
‘I have to talk to the Doctor,’ she snapped angrily.
On Belial Base, Bernice and Cheryl walked back into the Operations Room, and into the middle of a furious argument.
At Miles's request, the two women had taken Alex Bannen and his son back to his quarters.
He had curled up on to his bed at the first opportunity and fallen fast asleep.
His son had just stood there, staring at them, until they left.
They had returned to the Operations Room, where Bernice was surprised to hear Ace's voice — as far as anyone knew she was recovering with the rest of her party on Moloch — and even more surprised to hear it raised in anger and directed at — of all people — the Doctor.
‘You didn't have to lie to me, Professor.’
‘Ace, I don't understand —’
‘Oh shut up!
You make me sick.
You understand everything.
And you use everyone, for whatever little scheme  takes your fancy.
Remember Jan, do you, back on Heaven?
Remember what you did to him?’
‘But that was different —’
‘What about this, then, eh?’
Ace tried to thrust a ghostly neural net crystal underneath the Doctor's nose and only succeeded in pushing it out of the image field.
‘Don't try to deny it.
I don't know why you didn't erase it after her death.
Never had a chance, I suppose.
But you didn't expect me to go rummaging around in Paula's diary, did you?’
‘Ace, if you'd only let me explain!
I thought we were friends —’
‘Some friends you grow out of,Doctor .’
A sudden bang and a gabble of panicky voices distracted Ace's attention.
She looked sideways.
There were a few more garbled words, part of an argument, then a loud noise and a scream.
Something sprayed across Ace's face.
‘What the hell —’ she said, disbelievingly.
She tried to blink the red mist from her eyes, failed, and toppled backwards out of the image field.
Static.
Bernice gaped.
The Operations Room was engulfed by sudden chaos.
Miles was mumbling to himself.
Technicians were frantically operating systems.
Piper was yelling, ‘I couldn't give a toss for the time-lag on the frequency search-and-lock processor, just re-establish the bloody link!
Cheryl, help him will you.
Or take over, I don't care which.’
She turned to the shivering Administrator.
‘Miles, your daughter's spirit is not walking the base, and none of us are going with her to the afterlife.
Now for God's sake pull yourself together.
We need you here.’
Miles blinked.
‘Of course.
Sorry.’
‘I should think so too.’
Only the Doctor had not moved, through all this confusion.
Cheryl said, ‘I have a transmission.’
‘From Moloch?’
‘No.
From Adjudicator Bishop's spaceship.’
‘Get rid of him.’
‘Sorry; he's on priority override.’
Piper threw up her hands.
‘Put him on then.’
A representation of the Adjudicator blinked into life on one side of the room.
‘I've been monitoring the transmission from Moloch.’
‘Ace is in trouble,’ the Doctor said.
‘I have to go down there.’
‘We'll go together, Doctor.
I think the case may be breaking at last.’
‘I'm coming too,’ a voice piped beside Bernice.
It was Cheryl.
‘Sam's down there.’
The Adjudicator's image hesitated momentarily, then nodded.
‘Very well.
Trau Engado, I will be requiring your presence as well.
We leave immediately.’
Bernice sealed her starsuit helmet and stepped from the Adjudicator's spaceship on to Moloch's Bridge terminal.
She found herself standing on top of a translucent bubble set in Moloch's ice-bound landscape, close to one side of a bowl-shaped depression some fifty metres across.
High above them, the base of the Bridge passed through a cone of semi-transparent cables, which were anchored all around the edge of the depression, before continuing downwards to merge smoothly with the bubble itself.
Following the thread of light upwards into the darkness, Bernice found that the curves and kinks which had been so obvious from the surface of Belial had straightened out a little more.
The system was definitely coming back under proper control.
She began walking towards the depression, as four suited figures followed her from the ship, still arguing about the paperwork.
—‘Look at the Bridge,’ she said over the commlink.
‘It's self-repairing all right.’
‘It had to be,’ the Doctor replied.
‘Such a complex system, left to run for millennia, without the simplest  form of housekeeping?
No.
The only answer was an active control system.’
‘But where does the energy come from?’
Miles obviously had a command override.
He had been listening in.
‘Isn't it obvious?’ the Doctor said, not at all discomfited.
‘If it were obvious, we wouldn't have been here for five years trying to find it, and Paula would still be….
Would still be….’
‘Look around you.’
‘At what?’
Bernice asked.
‘At nothing.
At everything.’
Shrugging, Bernice followed the Doctor's instructions.
At first the glare from Lucifer — extending beyond Moloch's ice-locked horizon, and reflecting from Belial high above — turned the depths of space into a flat black backdrop that could just as well have been suspended a few feet in front of her eyes.
She sighed, squinted, and still saw nothing.
After a few moments, she realized that if she half closed the filters across the starsuit helmet she could cut out at least some of the light.
Within a few seconds, her eyes had compensated, and she could see what the Doctor meant.
Space was alive with ghostly curtains of light.
Pale violet in colour, they waved gently in some invisible wind.
Stars glinted through their folds.
Wherever she looked, there was faint colour and slow movement.
‘It's beautiful,’ Miles whispered.
‘Commonplace,’ Bernice said.
‘Charged particles interacting with the magnetic field of Lucifer.
You find aurorae around most planets.’
‘Quite right,’ the Doctor's voice crackled in her helmet.
Bernice could see him raise a bulky suited arm and gesture grandly at the surroundings.
‘But the Lucifer system is unusual in many respects.
The parent star is a red giant nearing the end of its life, and as it runs the gamut of fusion reactions, exhausting one element after another, the spectrum of particles it emits becomes exotic.
As the particles catch Lucifer's magnetic field, it is extended into  space like a fishing net caught by the tide.
And drifting through that net are two little fishes named Belial and Moloch, feeding off the rich plankton of energy.’
There was a long moment of silence.
‘Do you know what you're saying?’
Miles said, awestruck.
‘Occasionally,’ the Doctor replied.
Cheryl said slowly, ‘Are you trying to tell us that something, either here or on Belial, is extracting the energy from the variations in magnetic potential that the moons are passing through?’
‘Quite so.’
Bernice could hear the smugness in the Doctor's voice.
‘It's the Bridge.
It's got to be.’
Miles's voice was hushed, and Bernice saw his helmet tilt as he craned his neck upwards to look at the Bridge.
‘But the power….
Incredible!
It's hardly feasible that they….
And the storage problems!’
From the way his voice grew alternately loud and quiet, Bernice could tell that he was shaking his head.
‘Why didn't we realize?’
‘Like the purloined letter,’ said the Doctor smugly, ‘it was too obvious to see.’
Bernice followed his gaze upwards as Cheryl began to speak.
‘Yes,’ she said softly.
‘Yes, it would make sense.
The Lift moves up and down the Bridge, reacting to the stimulus of local magnetic field strength, riding the isogonal contours and providing information to the feedback mechanisms which direct its movement.
That explains the apparent randomness of its motion.
We were wrong.
It's not a transport system at all; it's a whomping great accumulator!’
Miles's voice was bitter with self-reproach.
‘All the power we could ever have wanted, and it's been right under my nose for years.’
‘You couldn't use it on Earth, of course,’ the Doctor said.
‘There's a huge difference between the magnetic fields, for a start, and the radiation from Lucifer's sun is quite, quite different.’
‘But it would have made all the difference to Project  Eden,’ Cheryl muttered.
‘Like your party trick with the neutrino collectors and the hymetusite: we couldn't have scaled it up enough to solve Earth's energy shortfall, but it could have supported us here whilst we searched for the long-term solution — the high-mass elements in Lucifer's core.’
Bernice had reached the apex of the terminal dome by now.
She moved through the conical root-system of cables which formed the Bridge's anchor, down towards the centre of the depression, and waited for the others to catch up.
As she waited, she began to study the anchor cables around her.
She looked upwards, trying to visualize how the Lift would be able to move past the point where they connected to the Bridge.
Before she got very far with her thoughts, she realized the cables were moving, rising past her….
No!
They weren't moving, she realized in sudden alarm, it was her: she was sinking.
She tried to take a step, but the suit wouldn't respond to her commands.
She looked down at her feet, and felt her blood run cold.
They weren't there.
She had sunk up to her ankles in the translucent bubble.
Even as she watched, the gooey material oozed up to her knees.
She tried to struggle, but she was held fast.
Thick fingers of the viscous substance were reaching up from the surface towards her starsuit's hips.
‘All aboard that's getting aboard,’ the Doctor said with relish.
‘This is supposed to happen?’
‘This, unless I'm very much mistaken, is the airlock.’
‘Well, that's original, to say the least.’
As the terminal surface moved past her helmet, she thought she could see a fine structure to it, a lattice of irregular cells which pulsed and churned while she watched.
Then darkness enfolded her, and she found herself standing on a solid surface in a shadowed room, staring upwards at the underside of the dimple with a strange sense of having been reborn.
Over to one side, the stalk of the Bridge penetrated  the soft surface and, in a network of roots and capillaries, grew into the floor.
There was a ragged hole in the side nearest her; she assumed this was where Ace and her companions had escaped from inside the hollow shaft.
Watching in fascination, she saw that the material was gradually reforming.
The surface above her bulged out into a number of large teardrop shapes which hung above her for a moment, trembling slightly, before depositing the Doctor, Miles, Cheryl and Bishop beside her.
She assumed that the Lift, under normal conditions, would have arrived in the terminal the same way.
The Doctor began to clamber out of his suit, peering around at his immediate surroundings.
‘This is all quite fascinating,’ he said, drawing his umbrella from his starsuit and using it to point at the terminal entrance.
‘Moloch's Pit should be this way.’
He set off at a brisk walk.
Bernice ran to catch up with him.
‘How could you know where the Pit was if you've never been here before?’ she asked curiously.
The Doctor didn't answer.
Bringing up the rear, Bishop frowned thoughtfully.
‘An interesting point, Krau Summerfield,’ he said mildly, to himself.
Ten minutes later, they had passed through the kilometre-thick crust of the moon via Moloch's Pit, and were moving once more into the human-designed areas of the base.
At the door to the Operations Room, the Doctor paused briefly and sniffed.
‘Hmm,’ he said, as the door slid open and he led the way inside.
‘Ionization.
That's odd.’
He took another sniff, wrinkling his nose with distaste.
‘What do we know that produces a smell like that?’
Bernice grinned.
‘Alex Bannen?’
The Doctor tut-tutted sternly; nobody smiled.
‘Electrical activity.’
Cheryl crossed the patchy carpet to the nearest window and began to study the landscape depicted on it.
The Doctor nodded thoughtfully.
He made a swift circuit  of the room, studying the read-outs of each station, pausing only once, to run his fingers across the MultiCray input terminal.
‘What are you doing to the neural net, Doctor?’
Bishop said sharply.
‘Checking to see how much damage has been done to it,’ the Doctor said with some irritation.
‘Damage?’
The Doctor tapped the side of his nose.
‘Electrical activity, remember?’
He indicated a diagnostic panel, where several red lights had begun to blink in confirmation of his words.
Information began scrolling across a virtual screen beside the Doctor's head.
Cheryl moved impatiently.
‘I've had just about all I can take of this mucking about.
If you want me, I'll be looking for Sam.’
She began to walk towards the door, but the Doctor stopped her with a look.
‘According to the roster, your husband was due here but never turned up,’ he said sternly.
‘That's ridiculous!’
Cheryl exclaimed in a voice that was far too loud.
‘This is a bloody nightmare.
Where are all the people?’
The Doctor had bent to examine something he had seen on the dappled carpet beside the communications terminal.
He stood almost immediately, and only Bernice noticed that, by aiming a bony finger at the floor, he was covering the fact that he'd pocketed something.
She moved closer to see what he was pointing at.
The patterns on the floor weren't part of the design of the carpet.
They were patches of blood.
When the Doctor spoke, his voice was dark and foreboding.
‘There's only one thing to do.’
Cheryl's voice was tense.
‘We'll have to search for them.’
The Doctor nodded.
‘Cheryl, I wonder if you would be so kind as to cast a professional eye over the experimental laboratories for me.’
Her voice was flat and harsh.
‘Am I looking for anything in particular?’
The Doctor was vague.
‘Oh, not really.
Anything unusual will do.
You could check on the medlab, too, if you wouldn't mind.
Bernice, I'd like you to check the grounds for signs of activity.
Trau Engado, I suggest you and Trau Bishop work back through the base, up the Pit and into the Bridge terminal.
I understand Paula had a laboratory there; that'll need to be checked.
I'll stay here and coordinate the search.
We'll all meet back here in precisely — oh, a couple of hours.’
He thought for a moment before adding dryly, ‘So long as that's all right with you, Adjudicator?’
Bishop said evenly, ‘I notice that this particular search pattern leaves you alone here, and free to —’
‘Steal the silverware?’
The Doctor raised an enquiring eyebrow.
Bishop said nothing.
The Doctor gestured towards the centre of the room.
‘Someone has obviously interfered with the neural net.
That means the security simulators are off-line.
If you know anything about how to repair a MultiCray, you are more than welcome to stay and help me.
Otherwise, you  can stay and make tea.
Arcturan, Lapsang Souchong or Earl Grey will be perfectly acceptable.
Such a civilized drink.’
Bishop did not rise to the bait.
‘Perhaps I should go with one of the ladies,’ he said.
‘After all, there may be danger.’
‘That's quite all right,’ Bernice said, frowning.
‘When you've drunk the crew of a Grinch pirate skiff under the table, there's precious little you can't do.
Besides, I think Miles has already made up his mind.’
While they had been talking, the Administrator had slipped quietly from the room.
Bernice shivered.
When they'd first arrived at the Base, she had quite liked the old Administrator, but since Paula's death he'd changed.
There was something disturbing about the way he'd just — well, just left — without saying anything.
What was he up to?
‘Well,’ the Doctor said briskly, ‘what are we waiting for?
We've all got plenty to do.
Let's get on and do it.’
Miles Engado, impatient at his slow progress through the Pit, padded softly along the track which spiralled from the Bridge terminus, through Moloch's kilometre-thick shell, to the research centre.
The sound of his footsteps was absorbed efficiently by the etched walls and curved pathway.
That left a lot of silence to fill, and Miles filled it with fear and guilt.
And with confusion.
The fear and the guilt were his own, but the confusion — that was a different matter.
It had originated from elsewhere, and infected him as surely as any virus.
Less than two days since Paula's death, and already her spirit was demanding the companionship of others on its journey.
How many would lose their lives to his daughter's marauding unrest, he wondered guiltily, and at whose door would the fault ultimately lie?
Miles felt the confusion in his mind grow into a relentless horror.
He was eighty-seven.
A man still in his prime.
A man of his century.
How could he believe, really believe , that this  primal stuff and nonsense, this superstition, could affect the day-to-day operation of the most important scientific expedition of its time?
Miles groaned inwardly, knowing instinctively that the how and the why of a thing were almost irrelevant when placed against the fact.
The fact was that he, the main proponent of the scientific method, was becoming increasingly frightened by a superstition society had considered dead before he was born.
The fact was he felt like a child again, powerless against forces he could not understand — let alone control.
With an effort, Miles shook off the lethargy that had been creeping over him since Paula's death, blinding him to his duties and responsibilities.
He'd made his decision.
Now it was time to carry it out.
The Doctor checked to make sure the Operations Room was properly deserted before inputting a simple command into the MultiCray.
Immediately, the blinking red lights on the diagnostic panel were replaced by steady green indicators.
The system was back on line.
For a moment, the Doctor toyed lightly with the simularity crystal he had found while looking at the blood on the floor.
He fed the crystal into a reader and watched with interest as the file scrolled up.
He kept one eye on the entrances to the Operations Room.
He knew Bishop was lurking around somewhere, but the Adjudicator presented no danger he couldn't anticipate.
Unlike Ace, apparently.
Oh well.
It was a simple enough matter to
‘Yes, I would have started with the simularity records as well.’
Bishop.
The Doctor smoothly keyed in a new sequence of commands.
‘Nice idea,’ he muttered off-handedly.
‘Shame about the software.’
‘The files are corrupt?’
Bishop asked.
‘Completely.’
‘Inconvenient, to say the least.’
‘Undoubtedly.’
‘Your recommendation?’
‘Tricky.’
‘But you do have one.’
‘Possibly.’
Bishop clasped his hands together and steepled his fingers.
When he spoke, his voice was completely without inflection.
‘It may interest you to know that I, too, am developing a theory, Doctor.
One in which your own involvement plays a significant part.’
The Doctor smiled engagingly.
‘You know, I was rather afraid you were going to say something like that.’
He turned and left the Operations Room.
Bernice lifted her face to the warming rays of an impossible sun, and wondered at the beauty and mystery of the universe.
Out on the fringes of the Vartaq Veil, looking for traces of her lost father, she had been part of a team excavating a Dyson sphere constructed around a white dwarf star.
Built from the debris of planets, moons and comets, the sphere had originally been designed to completely enclose its star, collecting all the energy it gave out rather than letting the vast majority of it escape away into space.
Like most engineering projects, it may have looked good on paper, but in practice it was another thing entirely.
Tidal stress and gravitational asymmetries had pulled the sphere out of shape.
Newtonian mechanics had done the rest.
By the time Bernice and her colleagues had arrived, it had degenerated into a series of unconnected fragments which drifted apart over thousands of years, gradually leaking their atmospheres into the vacuum.
The builders, overcome by the tragic outcome of their vast conception, had devolved into a shelled race who spent their nomadic existence migrating from one fragment of the sphere to another, living in the ruins of their once great cities and seeing the cosmos as a gigantic jigsaw puzzle being slowly assembled by God.
It was a funny old universe.
Bernice looked around.
Beautiful though the interior of the lower moon was, there was also something disturbing about it.
Perhaps it was the way the horizon curved upwards on all sides, like a bowl, or the way gravity worked when there shouldn't have been any.
Perhaps it was the way the translucent ‘grass’ seemed to develop an immediate and lasting attachment to anything or anyone that walked across it.
But she didn't think so.
Ordinarily she would have relished the variety which the creators of Moloch had offered up for her pleasure without a qualm or a second thought, but this time something was getting to her, making her nervous.
Itchy….
Oh.
It was the Veil.
Moloch reminded her of the Vartaq Veil.
Not the precise pattern of plants and trees beyond the human enclave, nor the affectionate grass, nor even the strange and delightful animal life — if it was animal life which peered from the undergrowth at the human installations with delicate curiosity.
No.
It was the quiet.
And a sense of history gone terribly wrong.
She shivered, despite the heat.
A wafer thin translucent something undulated through the air towards her, chuckling gently to itself in a liquid voice.
She put out a hand, and the thing wrapped itself around her arm, warm and dry and tingling — and Bernice was suddenly struck by a question so obvious it stunned her.
If the builders of this artificial paradise had not been around for several millennia — as Alex Bannen seemed to think — how come the flora and fauna hadn't run riot and completely ruined the environment?
Bernice ran the fingers of her free hand through her thickly beaded dreadlocks as she tried to think.
She was no naturalist, but it seemed to her that every living thing around her was controlled in some way, by some — force: prevented from over-breeding, over-growing.
In some way patterned.
She had a sudden feeling that if she could  only work out how the ecology of Moloch ticked, she would have a vital clue, if not to discovering Ace's whereabouts, then at least to getting a handle on the vanished aliens.
With any luck, the rest of the puzzle — the missing personnel, the mystery of the Angels and, not least of all, the rapidly sliding situation on the Base itself — might follow on from that.
Bernice shook loose the amiable scrap of nothing and watched as it fluttered away, lost in moments in the gentle glow of Moloch's endless day.
She rubbed her arm.
The skin tingled.
Cheryl palmed the access lock on the medlab door and the hatch rolled open.
She moved cautiously into the room.
‘Hello?
Christine?’
There was a sudden movement behind a bank of filing cabinets.
Cheryl sucked in an alarmed breath.
‘Sam?’
‘I'm afraid not.’
The Doctor.
‘Go away,’ she snapped.
‘I could do that,’ he said, emerging from behind the cabinets.
‘But I wouldn't be taking the problem with me, would I?’
‘Who says I want you to!’
Cheryl croaked out the words before lapsing into another long silence.
‘Why don't you tell me about it?
I guarantee it'll help.’
‘You wouldn't understand.
You're just a —’
‘Just a man?
Isn't that expression out of date yet?’
‘I was going to say….
Oh hell.
I don't know what I was going to say.’
‘That's good.
Now we can start fresh, with no preconceptions.’
The Doctor sat on one of the medlab's empty diagnostic beds, and drew his legs up into the lotus position.
‘I'm not ready to talk yet.
If you had any degree of sensitivity you'd be able to see that.’
Angrily.
Cheryl turned and left the room.
After a moment's thought, the Doctor followed her.
Miles re-entered the Bridge terminus.
The floor of the chamber was obscured by a silver mist that had risen since their arrival.
Tiny clouds swirled about his legs as he walked.
On impulse, he reached out and passed his hand through the vapour.
The silvery substance clung to his skin, looking like tiny beads of mercury, as slippery as graphite between his fingers.
Miles flicked his hand absently.
The stuff relinquished its grip upon him readily enough, drifting away to join the main mass of the stuff as it clustered around the end of the Bridge, where some kind of subtle activity seemed to be taking place.
Miles looked closer, his confusion momentarily overcome by curiosity.
The hole through which the survivors of B Shift had left the Bridge was knitting back together like cloth, the weave forming as the bulk of the mist reduced.
High above Miles's head, beyond the terminus bubble, the Bridge itself was trembling; it was becoming more difficult to see, as if something were being called into shape around the central shaft.
Miles blinked.
Something was forming around the Bridge: a new Lift.
Miles felt suddenly weary.
It was time to carry out his decision.
He walked through the Bridge terminus to the Atmospheric Vehicle Research Laboratory: the room where Paula had spent most of her working time.
The starpod, her creation, hung suspended in the engineering pit.
He looked around the room where she had spent much of the last few years.
So stark.
So cold.
He crossed to the open storage cabinets and ran his fingers along the rows of simularity crystals; her files, her notes, her diary.
Her life.
His fingers paused over one that was simply labelled ‘Dad’.
He pulled it out and looked at it blankly, then slipped it into his pocket.
Miles crossed decisively to the starpod, unsealed the  hatch and swung himself into the cabin, smiling as it snuggled shut behind him with a soft pneumatic wheeze.
He took one of the two pilot seats and began to strap himself in.
Activated by his body heat, the onboard systems began to power up.
A representation of the Laboratory sprang into life around him, fed into his modified cornea by low power laser beams.
Other sensors synched in with other senses.
He could see in a three hundred and sixty degree sphere via the pod sensor modules, just as he could feel the ambient temperature, and even smell the lubricant that someone had carelessly leaked on to the floor.
He moved his arm into a myo-feedback harness; a mechanical specimen grip unfolded and flexed in time with his movements.
He was the pod.
With a spoken command, he operated the control which would open the roof of the AVR Lab, allowing the pod access to free space.
Bishop pulled the crystal that the Doctor had left in the simularity reader free and turned it over and over in his hands.
He reached beneath his robes and pulled free the personal reader he'd brought from his ship.
Slipping the crystal into the device, Bishop watched as the file read up, observing the contents with great interest.
Evidence.
Suppressed evidence, no less.
He attached a judicial password to the file, saved it, pocketed both crystal and reader, and began to think hard about the information he'd discovered.
It could be the reason for everything.
Perhaps he was not as far short of solving this case as he had supposed.
Trying to avoid the undulants' over-affectionate advances, Bernice moved deeper into the jungle.
The ‘trees’ put her in mind of the Bridge: nests of translucent pink roots which burst from the powdery soil and curved upwards into single trunks which soared above  her head and fanned out again into an inverted cone of branches.
Put a beachball at both ends and the comparison would be perfect.
A faint breeze caressed the back of her neck.
She turned, and gasped.
A wave of movement was sweeping across the forest.
As it reached each tree in turn, the tree gracefully bent over, curving its trunk so that both roots and branches touched the ground.
The branches burrowed into the soil; the roots relinquished their grip.
The tree straightened, upside down, a perfect mirror image of itself.
‘Wow,’ she breathed.
When, after a few moments, no further miracles were forthcoming, she moved on.
As she walked, her mind was still puzzling over the mystery of Moloch's peculiar ecology.
She was sure there was a pattern there somewhere, a pattern which included the missing personnel, the carefully planted flora, the tingling undulant, everyth—
Hang on a minute.
Undulants?
Tingling undulants?
Bernice thought hard.
The Doctor had mentioned ionization when they'd first entered the Operations Room; ionization caused by electrical activity.
And the undulants displayed a conspicuous electric field whenever they moved; she'd felt it as static whenever they touched-her.
Bernice sucked in a deep breath, searching for a tell-tale smell — and there it was!
The faintest hint of….
Of
Her thoughts suddenly interrupted, Bernice gave a cry of surprise and horror.
On the ground in front of her was a motionless human hand.
Bernice swallowed hard.
The hand was connected to an arm, which vanished into the nearby undergrowth.
Bernice hesitated.
Skeletons in tombs and ancient embalmed bodies were one thing; this was entirely another.
She took her hip flask from her coveralls and emptied it in one long gulp.
Alcohol doped with various smart  chemicals stung her throat.
She looked down again.
The hand was still there.
The grass around it seemed to beckon her on.
Taking a deep breath, she forced apart the translucent boughs and peered through.
Jammed into the undergrowth were a number of dead bodies.
Ace's blood-soaked jacket lay on top of the pile.
Miles gazed out into space through the circular hatch in the roof of the chamber.
From somewhere beyond the artificial horizon, the Bridge arced up and away into the darkness, the lower part of its immense length in shadow, the upper glinting with fiery reflections from Lucifer's atmospheric corona.
Miles used his connection with the starpod to dim the chamber lights, and the stars sprang into sharp relief.
He wondered where Sol was.
He was an administrator, not an astronomer, and that question had always floored him.
Was Sol even visible from here?
He was damned if he knew.
Miles powered up the starpod's sensor arrays, enhancing his own senses and sending them arcing out into space in search of the planet of his birth.
Paula would have a companion on her journey to the afterlife.
He just wanted to say goodbye first.
To take one last look at the electronic signature which marked out his birthplace from the countless other star systems he could see.
To imagine for the last time the forests and oceans, green and alive, the way they'd always been in historical dramas.
The way they'd always been for his people: the fishers, the hunters.
There was a shadow.
Something vast and artificial.
Something…
…slipped through the ether and smashed into his mind.
Miles screamed and fell into an unforgiving darkness filled with endless pain and memories.
Piper O'Rourke looked up from the shift supervisor's desk as a dishevelled and embarrassed Alex Bannen  walked into the Belial Base Operations Room, followed by his son.
‘Sleep well, Alex?’
‘No.’
The physicist was clutching a plastic beaker from which he drank greedily.
‘That won't do you any good, you know.’
Alex's face assumed a shallow, humourless grin.
‘It's tea.’
Piper raised one eyebrow in a surprised apology.
‘Er how's….’
There was an awkward pause.
‘I'm sorry, I don't know his name.’
Bannen set down the beaker.
‘Mark.
Come in here.
I want you to meet a,’ he hesitated, ‘a colleague.’
There were hesitant footsteps.
Piper got up from her seat.
‘Hello, Mark.
I'm Piper.
We met before.’
The child's gaze was as piercing and intelligent as she remembered.
‘You're the woman who hates my dad.’
Piper closed her eyes.
And opened them sharply at an insistent, warning buzz from her duty station.
‘What's that?’
Bannen's son moved to examine readouts.
Perceptive, she thought.
But then, he would be.
‘I owe you an apology, Alex.’
‘Yeah.
Me too.’
He hesitated.
‘Sorry.’
‘Alex, what I need more than an apology is an explanation.’
He had the grace to look discomfited.
‘I would have thought it was all round Belial by now.’
‘We've had too much else to worry about.’
‘He's not real, you know.’
‘I know.
There's no way you could have kept him hidden for this long, and Moshe-Rabaan would have noticed any excess oxygen usage, so he's a simularity, right?’
‘Right.’
‘Why?’
Her voice softened.
‘Why not apply for real children?’
‘I did,’ he said levelly.
‘I had a son.
He died.’
Silence.
‘He died?’
Bannen rested his head in his hands.
Mark just looked on dispassionately.
‘Yeah.
I was married.
Her name was Sonia.
She was good.
A good person.
She wanted a child, so we signed up for the eugenics lottery.
We were both in the upper IQ bracket; we could've used channels, pulled strings, bypassed the system.
But she wanted to do it properly.
Be honest.’
His shoulders gave a little heave.
‘We got lucky.’
‘So what happened?’
‘Remember when America's economy collapsed, back in forty-six?’
Bannen's voice was so quiet that Piper had to strain to hear it.
‘I was teaching at MexTech at the time.
I was on campus when the food riots hit full swing.
Made it to the spaceport on a student bus.
Last suborbital off the ground.
I saw her in the crowd outside the ship as they sealed the lock.’
Bannen tried to take his son's hand, but his fingers passed right through the simularity field.
‘Saw them both.’
Piper felt something cold clench in her chest.
‘What — what happened?’
He looked up with bleak, pain-scarred eyes.
‘There were ten million people and no food,’ he whispered.
What do you think happened?’
Piper swallowed, her mouth suddenly dry.
Bannen said something in such a quiet voice she missed his words.
‘Pardon?’
‘I said, I could have gone back.
For Sonia and Mark.
I could have gone back for them.’
Piper found herself unable to meet the physicist's gaze.
‘I could have gone back.’
Bishop was collecting the shattered fragments of an observation drone for later analysis when the klaxons began.
The sound was a sharp, painful call to action.
Swiftly, Bishop accessed the neural net and locked down the source of the alert.
The Atmospheric Vehicle Research chamber.
Bishop activated a commdesk and punched in the requisite code.
A virtual screen lit up, immediately in front of his face.
The picture it showed appeared normal; then Bishop realized the dome of the chamber was open to free space.
Apparently there was some kind of unscheduled launch in progress, an experiment under preprogrammed control.
Bishop sighed.
So much to do already, and now this.
He left the Operations Room and was running up the Pit transport belt when Cheryl Russell swung in from a side corridor and very nearly cannoned into him.
‘That's an experimental research warning,’ she cried.
‘What's going on?’
Bishop studied her face for a brief second.
He noted the tear tracks for later consideration.
‘Stop gathering wool,’ she snapped.
‘Someone's triggered the alarm.
It could be an emergency!’
‘The neural net identified the AVR chamber as the source of the alert.’
‘Well, come on then!’
The main base entrance rolled shut behind Bernice, replacing the constant pinkish daylight of Moloch with the flat white glare of artificial light.
Catching sight of the back of Bishop's robes vanishing along the corridor leading to the Pit, Bernice began to follow automatically, but a firm pressure on her arm prevented her from continuing.
Her forward movement abruptly halted, Bernice threw the Doctor a cool glance.
Apologetically, he removed his hand.
He waved his umbrella in a distracted manner.
‘Operations Room,’ he said vaguely.
‘Why?’
The Doctor's eyes suddenly focused.
‘There's something I have to show you.’
The control room was exactly as she had left it.
In a  beaker at one of the duty stations cold tea rippled in time with the siren.
Bernice perched on the edge of the shift supervisor's desk, watching as the Doctor strode quickly to the neural net cabinets and began to access a series of subsystems.
He looked puzzled, then worried.
He thumped the desk with an uncharacteristic display of temper.
‘It's gone!’
He quickly searched all his pockets.
‘How could I have been so stupid?’
‘It's Ace, isn't it?’
The Doctor sighed deeply, withdrawing his hands from his pockets.
‘Well?’
He looked away.
‘There are some things I need to know.
I would ask her myself but —’
Bernice's eyes narrowed as she deliberately missed the point.
‘But she doesn't trust you any more.’
‘That's right.’
‘So what do you want to know?’
‘I've hurt her, Bernice.
I keep hurting her.
With the best of intentions, but still the pain exists.
The mistrust.
The feeling of betrayal.’
The Doctor looked away from Bernice for a moment, and she could have sworn it was with genuine remorse.
‘You're human.
Tell me how I can make it up to her.’
‘I'm sorry.’
Bernice quickly unrolled the bundle she'd been carrying beneath her arm and thrust Ace's blood-soaked jacket into the Doctor's hands.
‘I think it may be too late for words.’
Cheryl slapped home a series of circuit breakers mounted on a plinth beside the AVR chamber monitor station.
Immediately, she felt the floor vibrate as the dome rumbled shut, sealing the chamber.
Air pumped in as the warning sirens died away.
She waited impatiently as the pressure equalized inside the dome, finally punching an override and unsealing the lock early.
She pounded into the frost-rimed chamber, breath freezing in front of her face, checking each possible  place of concealment for a figure, dreading what she might find.
There was nothing.
She turned her attention to the starpod.
If someone were still alive, that was where they'd be.
A moment behind her, Bishop entered the chamber, robes a-flap.
He watched as she unsealed the lock on the starpod.
Ice cracked away from the hatch at a pressure from inside.
Cheryl let out an involuntary gasp of surprise as a limp body fell clear of the vehicle to lie still upon the chamber floor in a slurry of melting ice.
Miles Engado.
Bishop carefully watched as first bitter disappointment and then professional concern chased startled horror from the woman's face.
Despite everything, had Cheryl expected to find her husband there?
Bernice and the Doctor entered the monitor room in time to help Cheryl stretch Miles out on the floor next to an open medkit, while Bishop probed intently into the racks of recording systems.
Bernice quickly moved the medkit to Cheryl's side.
‘What happened to him?’
‘I've no idea.’
Cheryl passed a diagnostic wand across the Administrator's head and torso.
‘According to this, he's in second-level unconsciousness.
I found him hooked up to the interactive software in the starpod.
Heaven alone knows what he was doing in there.’
She prepared an injector pad.
‘Thinking of Paula maybe.’
The Doctor moved across to where Bishop was still methodically accessing the gallery records.
‘Find anything interesting?’
Bishop kept his face carefully neutral.
‘All systems are off line.
Diagnostics report what can only be described as an — invasion.
The software is corrupt and will need to be rebooted.
All records of the last fifteen minutes have been erased.’
The Doctor leaned on his umbrella, his face assuming an expression of innocent concentration.
‘Sounds familiar, doesn't it?’
His voice hardened.
‘Someone's covering up a trail.’
‘I would have to agree.’
‘The question is, who?’
The Doctor allowed his eyes to fall to those of Miles Engado, as they moved spasmodically behind closed lids.
Remembering.
Bishop noted the direction of the Doctor's gaze, and his eyes narrowed as he regarded the Administrator's disturbed expression.
He would know what had happened to the software, and why.
Bishop felt the slight weight of a simularity crystal in the pocket of his robe and allowed himself an inward smile.
Despite all prevarication, the evidence was building.
Soon a solution would be found.
And justice would be served.
‘Adjudicator?’
Bishop looked at the Doctor.
‘There's something you ought to know.’
Two hours later, Piper  O'Rourke , Alex Bannen and a medical team were waiting as the Adjudicator's ship locked home against the Belial Bridge terminus.
Alex fidgeted impatiently as Miles was brought forth on a stretcher, ignoring the welfare of the Base Coordinator completely.
There were more important things he needed to find out; things only the Doctor could tell him.
He moved forward importantly, pushing past Bernice and Cheryl as if they did not exist.
‘Doctor — I must talk to you.
Was there any record concerning the structure of the Bridge's interior?’
‘No, Alex, we didn't find Ace or Christine.
But thank you for asking,’ Bernice muttered angrily.
Alex glared at Bernice.
‘You're a scientist.
You should understand that knowledge takes precedence over corpses.
In my opinion, it may be the only way to prevent more deaths.’
With cold and deliberate fury, Bernice began to explain to the scientist exactly what she thought of his ‘opinion’.
The Doctor interrupted her gently.
‘I'm afraid Trau Bannen is right, Bernice.’
Bernice threw the Doctor a disgusted look.
Bannen leaned attentively towards the Doctor and they began to speak in low voices.
Bernice suddenly found she badly needed a drink, but her hip flask was empty.
She began to make her way towards the entrance to the Pit.
The sound of someone's throat being cleared as a preliminary to speaking aloud caused her to stop.
‘If I could have your attention, please.’
Bernice turned; Bishop had laid claim to an area of floor.
Cheryl and Piper, the Doctor, Alex, and the medical team all stopped talking.
Bishop continued, ‘I would like to take this opportunity to inform you all that the judicial process requested by Miles Engado regarding the death of his daughter has now reached a conclusion.
That conclusion is that Paula Engado was murdered.’
There was a hushed whisper of horror from the listening personnel.
Bernice felt a sick feeling begin to develop in her stomach.
The feeling intensified as Bishop concluded his short speech in even, measured tones.
‘I have in my possession a simularity file which clearly establishes the guilt of the murderer.
It is now my duty to pass sentence.’
As Bernice watched, horrified, Bishop produced a large handgun from beneath his robes and aimed it squarely at the Doctor's head.
A security drone circled like a fat, lazy insect in front of the door to the Conference Room.
‘It's all right,’ Bernice said to it, raising her hands in surrender.
‘I have permission.
Signed, sealed and in triplicate.
‘Temporary Authorisation, Prisoner, For The Visit Of’, Guild of Adjudicators form one nine five three slash three.’
The drone orbited mindlessly.
‘Come on, Bishop, I know you're watching me.’
The door remained shut.
Bernice reached into a pocket of her waistcoat and took out a grimy piece of paper: a bar receipt from some long-forgotten dive on a far away planet.
‘I have in my hand,’ she said ominously, ‘a ‘Gratuitous Acts of Vandalism, Drones, To Be Performed On’, Bernice Summerfield form zero zero zero.’
She paused.
‘Slash zero.’
She crossed her arms confidently.
After a moment, the door slid open.
Bernice grinned as she walked into the Conference Room.
Applied psychology: there was no beating it.
The Doctor was hovering above the conference table in the classic lotus position.
His hands rested, palms up, on his knees.
Another drone orbited the room near the ceiling.
The sudden breeze introduced through the open door disturbed the orbit of the drone and sent the Doctor drifting slowly backwards.
His eyes opened in alarm, but before he could say anything his concentration lapsed and he dropped like a stone, vanishing behind the far end of  the table.
There was a loud thud, and a torrent of abuse in an obscure Venusian dialect.
The drone buzzed curiously across the room and vanished behind the table, making its own checks on the Doctor's health.
Bernice didn't know whether to laugh or cry, so she settled for sarcasm.
‘Aren't Time Lords supposed to be above that sort of language?’
‘It was a Venusian lullaby,’ the Doctor said, clambering up from behind the table and cramming his hat back on to his head.
The drone was orbiting his head like a dizziness star in an ancient cartoon.
He glared at the offending object angrily.
‘I find it useful to recite calming verse in moments of great stress.’
‘Calming verse?
Klokeda partha mennin klatch ?
You've got to be joking!
It's one of the most bawdy rhymes in the known universe.’
‘Venusian is a language, as dead as dead can be’,’ the Doctor quoted with great dignity.
‘If I say it's a lullaby, then it's a lullaby.’
‘Oh yes?
And who was it who decoded the Mk'kur'qa Inscriptions, then?
Who worked out the structure of the language from first principles, then?
Who is arguably the foremost galactic authority on the Venusian race?’
‘Not you, surely?’
Bernice shrugged.
‘Well, actually, no.
But I met him once.’
The Doctor grinned, and so did she.
‘I tell you,’ she continued, ‘the bit that I could never figure out was that ablark, araan, aroon refrain.
What was that all about?’
‘Ah,’ the Doctor sighed, nodding wisely.
‘It's to do with the number of limbs they had.
More opportunities.’
He rolled the word around in his mouth, savouring it.
‘And shunna teerenatch ?’
He shuddered.
‘Don't ask.’
She gazed at the small, gaudily dressed figure; the clown, the madman, the genius.
‘You know so much, don't you.’
‘Too much,’ he replied softly.
‘Far too much.’
Her gaze hardened.
‘Sometimes I hate you for it,’ she said, more harshly, perhaps, than she had intended.
‘I've spent years reconstructing, integrating, analysing and just plain digging through mud; cataloguing alien ruins square centimetre by square centimetre and sticking together the pieces of damaged artifacts to form implausible shapes.
Then you come along, and you tell me not only who made it but what his name was, how many eggs he laid and the colour of his tentacles.
Archaeology is my life, Doctor.
And you've made archaeology worthless to me.’
The Doctor thought for a moment.
‘Have I?’
‘Yes!
It's as if I've wasted my life searching for something that was never lost in the first place.
What's the point?’
‘Did you enjoy yourself?’ he asked.
She smiled wistfully, remembering old friends, good times.
‘Wouldn't have missed a second of it.’
‘There you are then.’
He looked away, and shrugged.
‘I collect pins.
Where's the point in that, if you'll forgive the pun?
But I enjoy it.
I'm fulfilled by it.
Too many people spend too much time looking for a reason, and fail to take advantage of the simple pleasures that life offers.’
Bernice ran her fingers along the table top.
No dust.
This room had no secrets to hide.
‘You know the worst thing about being here?’
The Doctor perched on the edge of the table, took his hat off and batted the buzzing drone away into a distant corner.
Persistently, the device moved back towards them.
The Doctor smiled at it, waited for it to approach — then whipped his hat through the air and down on to the table, neatly trapping the drone beneath it.
‘I think so,’ he said seriously, and for a moment his expression assumed the full weight of his nine-hundred-odd years.
‘It's knowing, isn't it?
Knowing what's ahead.’
‘The curse of being a time travelling archaeologist.’
Bernice looked away.
‘How many years of peace have they got left?’
‘Probably less than you think.’
The Doctor glanced  sideways at his hat.
It was sidling towards the edge of the table.
He reached out with his umbrella and hooked the hat back.
An indignant buzzing sound came from beneath it.
‘The lights are going out all over the galaxy,’ he said softly.
‘They shall not see them lit again in their lifetimes.’
He looked over at Bernice.
‘Have you seen the news from the latest pigeon post?’
Bernice nodded.
‘It's like seeing a snowball start to roll down a mountain.
You know at the bottom it's going to be avalanche time.
And the latest message pod was more than six months late, by all accounts.’
She looked down at the diminutive Time Lord, her eyes full of quiet sympathy.
‘I learned to live with it,’ he said, in reply to her unspoken question.
‘I deal with today's problems today.
Tomorrow's problems I solve yesterday.’
‘But what about the problems here — the sabotage, the murders?’
‘Unrelated,’ the Doctor said, once more reaching for his hat.
He flipped it over, allowing the drone to escape.
It immediately flew across the room, maintaining a wary distance.
The Doctor reversed his hat, flipped it back along the length of his arm and perched it nonchalantly on his head.
‘This is a purely human evil.
And talking of which, what's been happening in the world at large since my incarceration in this impromptu dungeon?’
‘Where do you want me to start?’
‘Ace,’ he said quietly.
‘Start with Ace.’
Bernice sighed.
‘Doctor, you have to understand.
The conditions of the….’
She swallowed.
‘Piecing the bodies together is going to be a full-time job for some poor bastard.
At the moment they've found…
Kosi, and…
Chas Varley's arm.
They recognized it by his ring.
But the rest are too badly burned or in too many pieces to identify without DNA tests, and that'll take time.
Judging by the reconstruction work, there is considerable evidence of small arms fire: flamers, needlers and the like.’
She paused.
‘But there's also evidence that some of them just — exploded from inside.’
‘And what's Trau Bishop doing about it?’
‘He's locked away in Miles's office, scanning every simularity he can find with your face in it.
I don't know what he's got on you, but it must be good.
He's setting up a drumhead court-martial for tomorrow.’
‘Followed, no doubt, by summary execution.’
The Doctor cast a dark glance up at the innocently circling drone.
Bernice tried to read his expression, but it was untranslatable.
But she had to know.
‘Cheryl's nearly hysterical,’ she offered, with carefully calculated innocence.
‘There's no sign of Sam anywhere.’
The Doctor wasn't going for the bait.
‘Rumour Control has it,’ she added, ‘that he's either an undiscovered victim or your accomplice.
Craig Richards is running a sweepstake on it.’
‘What are the odds on me?’
‘Favourite for a short trial and a quick death,’ Bernice said, and immediately wished she hadn't.
‘There's something else, isn't there?’
She sighed.
‘I could be imagining it, but….
Well, people seem to be turning against us.
Nobody's saying anything, not to my face anyway, but there's something about the way they move, and the way conversations change tack when I walk into rooms.
It's very subtle, but there's an undercurrent of distrust that wasn't there yesterday.’
He gazed up at her with eyes much, much older than his face.
‘It's you, isn't it?’ she said, with sudden realization.
‘Wherever we land, people accept us.
I've always wondered why, just like I've always wondered how we can always understand what everyone says, no matter what language they're speaking.
And now you're out of the way, whatever spell you've put on them is fading.’
He just smiled sadly.
‘And do you do the same to Ace and me?
Do you blind us to your faults?’
‘Et tu ?’ he quoted softly.
‘You said something, didn't you?’
‘About what, Bernice?’
‘About what I told you.
Cheryl and Paula.’
The Doctor adjusted the brim of his hat to shadow his eyes.
‘Of course not,’ he said, but she didn't believe him.
Rabbi Shmuel Zehavi was leaving Miles Engado's quarters as Piper arrived.
‘How is he?’ she asked.
The wiry psychologist shook his head, almost dislodging his embroidered skullcap in the process.
‘Oy!’ he exclaimed.
‘That meshuggener !
He's already broken three appointments to see me.
‘Pressure of work,’ he says, as that's an adequate excuse.
I've tried to tell him that the last thing Project Eden needs is an Administrator who's crazy as a dakkabug, but will he listen to me?’
Before per could enquire further about Miles's odd behaviour, Zehavi moved rapidly away down the corridor, muttering angrily to himself.
More worried now than she liked to admit, Piper extended her search for the Base Administrator to the refectory.
The Bridge disaster, along with the subsequent events on Moloch, had thrown Piper's carefully calculated schedules into complete disarray.
Members of all three shifts were milling about the circular room: repeating rumours, distorting facts and generally hyping themselves up.
Piper spotted Alex Bannen and his son sitting in the centre of the refectory.
The table before them was loaded down with jellies and ice cream.
Unbelievable, she thought.
For years he keeps the kid hidden away like the greatest secret in the galaxy, and now he's showing him off for everybody to see.
And then she saw Miles.
He was sitting alone, off to one side, watching a historical simularity, shipped in on the last supply drone, that vas playing in the centre of the room.
She walked over and joined him at the table.
‘Miles?’
He didn't react.
‘Miles!
I've been worried.’
His gaze flickered over her, then back to the simularity.
‘You know the Doctor was arrested for Paula's murder while you were unconscious?’ she said, trying to provoke a reaction.
‘That charlatan?’
His lip curled slightly.
‘He deserves to die.’
Piper looked away for a moment.
‘I must know what happened to you down there on Moloch.
Cheryl's been saying some odd things.
Bishop's not saying anything, and as for Bernice and the Doctor —’
‘The Doctor again.
Always the Doctor.
I've been suspicious of him since he first arrived.’
Piper frowned, trying to remember exactly how the Doctor and his friends had arrived on the base.
She pulled her thoughts back to the present with an effort as Miles stood.
‘No wait — don't go!’
Wearily, Miles sat down again.
‘Tell me about it, Miles.
I have to know.’
There was a long pause.
‘I was in the pod.
Paula's starpod.
It was all powered-up and ready to go.
I…
I just wanted to look at the Earth.
Well — Sol, anyway.
If the instruments could pick it up from here.
I was looking for it.
I saw something.
A waveform….
Then there was just pain.
Endless pain.
And,’ he hesitated.
Piper nodded eagerly.
‘Yes?’
‘And — I woke up here, in the medlab.
Zehavi wanted to analyse my brain, but I'm fine.
I keep telling him that.
I'm fine.’
‘I know,’ she said.
‘I wish everyone would just leave me alone!’
His voice softened.
‘Except you, Piper.
You care.
And….’
He stood again.
‘There's something I need to show you.’
Some kind of historical simularity was coming to an end as Bernice entered the crowded refectory, passing Miles Engado and Piper O'Rourke as she did so.
She watched, fascinated, as the beautiful computer expert destroyed hideous alien invaders and claimed the handsome young museum curator as her own.
As the end credits rolled and the title came up, she realized that it was a dramatized retelling of the Martian invasion of Earth circa 2090.
She would never have guessed it from the wildly anachronistic costumes.
She smiled, remembering.
She had made her reputation excavating the abandoned Ice Warrior citadels on Mars…at was many years ago in her own personal time-scale, many years in the future of the era she was in.
It was also first time she had been back to Earth since being drafted into Spacefleet, escaping, and running for the stars in a clapped-out old trading ship owned by a clapped-out old trader.
Climbing painfully up monolithic shafts of blue crystal.
Making love with Tim in the vaulted egg chambers.
Finding carded shells stacked up with piles of Ice Marshal helmets, their glistening wetware implants still intact.
The temptation to don one, to experience Martian life firsthand, almost overpowering…
She shook herself, and walked on.
Her visit to the Doctor seemed to have stirred up old memories, like sediment at the bottom of a pond.
Cheryl Russell was seated on the far side of the refectory, watching the simularity.
Although the credits had finished, and the picture had been replaced by a robotic continuity announcer, Cheryl's expression had not changed.
‘Fancy a drink?’
Bernice stopped by Cheryl's table and held out her refilled flask.
‘Thanks,’ Cheryl said, and to Bernice's amazement, drained the entire flask without stopping for breath.
‘Cheryl, there's something I ought to tell you.’
‘I've lost them both,’ Cheryl said, without intonation.
‘I tried to talk to you the night before last, but —’
‘First Paula and then Sam.’
It was as if she wasn't listening.
‘Look, I think I owe —’
‘You told someone, didn't you?’
‘Oh Cheryl, I didn't mean to.’
Bernice hung her head.
God, she thought, how did it ever come to this?
‘Sam found out that I was seeing Paula.
He never said anything, but I knew that he knew, because he was nicer to me than he had ever been before.
Then Paula died, and Sam disappeared, and I can't find him on Belial, and I can't find him on Moloch, and part of me is frightened that he might be dead, and part of me is frightened that he's not.’
She lowered her gaze to the plate of food she had ordered a while ago.
She toyed with it with her fork, pushing it slowly around the plate, swirling it into patterns.
Without raising her eyes, Cheryl whispered, ‘You were the only one….’
In the background, a news simularity presenter was wittering on.
Bernice tried to focus her mind on the report, which featured outbreaks of a mystery virus that had wiped out millions in the barrios of  Brasilia , Los Angeles and Tycho City.
She had almost succeeded, when Cheryl looked up from her food.
Bernice found herself unable to look away, inexorably drawn to the guilt and sadness she saw in Cheryl's face, and which she blamed herself for.
‘The only one who knew we were sleeping together,’ Cheryl continued, ‘and —’
‘Cheryl, I'm sorry!
I didn't mean to walk in on you.
‘I keep wondering why I did it,’ Cheryl said, as if Bernice hadn't spoken.
‘It's not as if I don't love Sam, because I do.
I love him like nothing else in my life, but Paula and I had been together when we were all planning Project Eden, before I even met Sam, and I loved her too, and somehow I just couldn't stop seeing her….’
The news broadcast had moved on to other matters now; the loss of contact between Earth Central and a Space Fleet flotilla which had been on its way to intercept a supposed alien fleet near Epsilon Eridani.
Bernice  remembered her conversation with the Doctor, and shivered.
History ought to stay where it belongs, she thought: in the past.
‘Cheryl,’ she said carefully, ‘when I walked in on you and Paula Engado, I was — surprised.
I wanted to talk to someone about it.
But I swear, I only mentioned it to one person, and he's the most trustworthy person I've ever met.
He wouldn't have told anybody.
Not Sam, or anyone.’
‘Who was that?’
Cheryl asked, uninterestedly.
‘The Doctor,’ Bernice said.
Cheryl looked at her for the first time.
‘I should have guessed,’ she said bitterly.
‘You're in it together, aren't you?
I don't know how you all managed to worm your way into our confidence, but someone's already taken care of one of your friends, and the other will be lucky if he lives until his trial.’
‘What?
Cheryl, what do you —’
But Cheryl did not reply.
She stalked off, leaving Bernice shaken and alone.
As Miles opened the door to his office, Piper could see Adjudicator Bishop sitting at Miles's desk.
A simularity of the Doctor sat above Miles's desk, strobing slowly in extreme close-up.
Bishop's hand flicked the surface of the desk, blanking the picture.
‘Can I help you?’
‘I was hoping to be able to use my office,’ Miles said slowly.
‘That won't be possible.
I'll be needing it for the rest of the day,’ Bishop said.
‘Guild of Adjudicators business.
Perhaps another office?’
‘Use mine,’ Piper said, pulling Miles away before he said something she might regret.
Miles was silent as he followed Piper to the Technical Support area.
He walked so slowly that Piper had to stop every few seconds and wait for him to catch up.
When they arrived, he hesitated on the threshold, waiting for her to lead the way.
‘Tea?’ she said.
‘Synthetic, or the real stuff?’
‘Need you ask?’
She placed scoops of tea essence into a couple of beakers and added water from the reconstituter.
She could see him out of the comer of her eye, removing a crystal from his pocket and placing it in her desk reader.
By the time she turned around, Paula Engado was frozen in space like a china figurine.
A wave of guilt washed over her and receded, leaving her feeling slightly sick.
‘Like a ghost,’ Piper said.
‘Pardon?’
‘Paula.
She haunts this Base like a ghost.’
Miles winced, and Piper suddenly realized what she had said.
‘I didn't mean….
Not literally, Miles!
For heaven's sake, it was a metaphor.’
‘Of course.’
He paused, and passed a shaky hand across his face.
Piper watched as he typed instructions into the desk.
‘It was with her diary, down in the AVR lab on Moloch,’ Miles said, a slight catch in his voice.
He hit <RETURN> and the tiny figure in the simularity began to move.
Paula ran a hand through her hair, and took a deep breath.
Her heart was pounding, and she felt sick.
Okay, she thought, here goes….
‘Dad,’ she said, ‘if you're watching this, then I'm dead.’
The palms of her hands were sweating, and she wiped them against the legs of her tunic.
‘I need to be alone for a while, and there's nowhere  here on Belial or Moloch where that can be true for any length of time.
Whatever I do, I seem to hurt someone.
I've had a talk with….’
She hesitated, wondering whether to name the person, but decided on the spur of the moment against it.
Dad would only blame them for what she was doing.
‘Well, with a friend.
And I think I can see things a bit more clearly now.
I'm going down into Lucifer's atmosphere in a starsuit.
I know it's risky — a lot more risky than if I waited for Yukio to finish programming the starpod — but I just need to get away for a while, by myself, and think.
If I'm lucky then I'll be back with some decent results before anyone knows that I'm gone.
If I'm really lucky then I'll come back with a tame, talkative Angel for you.
If my luck has run out….
Well, I'm going to leave this simularity in the starpod for you.
I know you'll find it.’
She slipped one hand into a pocket, and scratched her nose with the other.
So far, so good, she thought.
‘There's something I need to say to you, Dad, and I'll never have the courage to do it face to face.
When….’
The words seemed to catch in her throat.
Every time she thought about her mother, the tears were there.
It was like the pain from an old wound, so familiar that she never noticed it until she deliberately picked at the scar.
‘When Mum finally….
When she….
You just locked yourself up tight and never talked about her again.’
The tears were coming; she could feel them.
‘And I wanted so hard for you to love me.
I worked my guts out getting my Doctorate, so that I could be a member of Project Eden and be with you.
But it was like you never noticed me.’
Warmth on her cheek, and the muscles at the corners of her mouth were clenching, dragging her lower lip downwards.
‘You never noticed me.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I know you and Piper are — are more than friends, but please Dad, don't — don't marry her.
It wouldn't be fair.
It wouldn't be fair to Mum.
And it wouldn't be fair to Piper, because I know how much you still love Mum, even though you never say so.’
It was no good.
She was losing it.
She had to cut it  short now and just leave, otherwise she wouldn't have the courage to do it.
‘Goodbye, Dad,’ she sobbed.
‘If I'm lucky, you'll never have to watch this.
I love you, remember that.
I love you….’
She stabbed at the recorder controls, though her eyes were blurred with tears and she couldn't even see them.
<STOP>
<END>
Miles fumbled for the right controls, and eventually stopped the simularity.
His eyes glittered with unshed tears.
‘Piper, I'm sorry,’ he choked, and reached out for her.
‘Thanks, Miles.
You really know how to inspire confidence in a woman.’
She turned and walked away.
‘No, wait!
You don't understand.
That's what Paula thought, not what I —’
It was too late.
He was talking to a closed door.
Bernice knocked at Miles Engado's door.
There was no answer, but then, she wasn't expecting any.
She had seen the Adjudicator leave a few minutes before.
The door wasn't locked, and the simularity crystal was still in the desk reader.
Whatever evidence Bishop had on the Doctor, she had to check it out.
And then….
Well, all archaeologists were thieves, of a sort.
She pressed <RUN>, glad now that she kept forgetting to take her simularity contact lenses out.
Two heads appeared in mid-air: the Doctor's and Paula Engado's.
Judging by the settings, the scene was being told from Paula's point of view.
As the conversation replayed, Bernice felt herself go cold.
‘Did Cheryl really say that?’
Paula's voice was shrill, disbelieving.
‘She loves me, but she can't leave Sam?’
‘That's what she told me.’
The Doctor's voice was harsh.
‘It's all so stupid!’
Paula said, on the verge of tears.
‘It doesn't matter what you think,’ the Doctor sneered.
‘It's Cheryl's feelings that count.’
A sudden hatred of Sam Russell welled up within Paula.
‘I know how Sam is going to feel,’ she hissed.
‘Don't be stupid.’
‘You're right,’ she sighed.
‘It's Cheryl's decision.
I can't argue with that.’
‘And are you still going down in the starsuit?’
Paula gazed into the Doctor's bleak eyes.
What is there left here for me? she thought.
I might as well end the pain now.
He nodded, as if he could read her thoughts, and moved to leave.
‘I might not be coming back,’ she said.
He nodded, and left.
‘Damning, isn't it,’ said a voice from the doorway as the scene cut off.
Bernice looked up.
Bishop was watching her.
‘Superficially,’ she admitted.
‘It's Paula's own simularity diary.
It was still recording when the Doctor walked into the lab on Moloch.
It looks to me as if the Doctor manipulated Paula Engado's feelings with a faked message from her adulterous lover Cheryl Russell to the effect that Cheryl wouldn't leave her husband, Sam.
The Doctor suggested a method of suicide.
Paula, distraught, took his advice.
Some time later, Krau Ace discovered the crystal and accused the Doctor of manipulating Paula's suicide.
The Doctor arranged for Ace, and all potential witnesses on Moloch, to die.
Am I missing any salient events?’
‘The death of the Energy Policeman, Moshe-Rabaan,— and the disappearance of Sam Russell?’
Bernice replied snappily.
‘Oh, Krau Rabaan controlled the security drones.
Perhaps the Doctor suspected she too might have evidence against him, and killed her.
Sam….
Well, a cuckolded husband — I'm sure I can fit him in somewhere.’
‘A trifle thin.’
‘It's all I need.’
Bernice thought quickly, trying to remember her history.
Like lag-ships and vargol generators, simularities had died out pretty quickly in historical terms.
The fad hadn't lasted to her time, but she still remembered articles in the learned techno-archaeology journals.
‘These simularities, they can be set to interpret body language and voice inflection, can't they?’
‘That's their main function,’ he said, inclining his head.
‘The neural net records all details of a scene — body posture, words, tone of voice, movement — and when the scene is replayed it enhances certain features to make the record less ambiguous.’
‘Enhances?’
Bernice was on to something.
Bishop didn't seem discomfited.
‘Yes.
For instance, if somebody shows evidence of being tense whilst being questioned, that can be emphasized in order to make their behaviour clearer.’
‘But any characteristic can be enhanced.’
‘In theory, yes.’
Somewhere at the back of her mind, it occurred to Bernice that Bishop was giving her an awful lot of rope.
‘May I try an experiment?’ she asked.
Bishop gestured to the table.
‘But I do have copies of the simularity,’ he warned.
Bernice tried to recall the initial lessons that Cheryl had given her, soon after the TARDIS had landed on Belial.
Her fingers danced over the keyboard, uncertain at first, then more sure.
‘Let's try it from a different perspective,’ she said, and pressed <RUN> again.
‘Did Cheryl really say that she loves me?’
Paula asked ecstatically.
The Doctor nodded.
‘But she can't leave Sam,’ she said, hoping that the Doctor would contradict her.
It was all too good to be true.
‘That's what she told me.’
He smiled conspiratorially.
‘It's all so stupid,’ Paula said, and giggled.
‘It doesn't matter what you think,’ the Doctor chided gently.
‘It's Cheryl's feelings that count.’
‘I know how Sam is going to feel,’ she said wistfully.
‘Don't,’ said the Doctor, and shook his head.
Paula searched his eyes for an answer.
‘Be stupid!’ he encouraged, and smiled.
‘You're right.’
She smiled back.
‘It's Cheryl's decision.
I can't argue with that.’
‘And are you still going down in the starsuit?’
She remembered the smoothness of Cheryl's skin, the fullness of her lips.
‘I might not be,’ she said.
He got up, startling her.
There was something about his presence that made her feel calm and peaceful.
‘Coming back?’ she asked, as he raised his hat.
He nodded, and left.
‘You see,’ Bernice said triumphantly.
‘Same words, different meanings.
The Doctor could be innocent!’
‘I know,’ Bishop said.
‘I've run fifteen variations of that conversation, and every one has come up with different motivations for the Doctor.
Either the software is playing up, or your friend is the most complex character I have ever had the pleasure of arresting.’
‘In that case —’
The floor shook with a distant explosion.
Klaxons began to wail.
‘Bloody hell!
What was that?’
‘The Conference Room.’
Bishop's voice was so calm Bernice wanted to scream.
‘Oh Christ.
The Doctor!’
Bernice left the office at a dead run.
By the time she reached the Conference Room, the air was filled with the smell of burning, more even than the atmosphere recyclers could deal with.
The corridor was filled with people, some wielding fire extinguishers, others rushing medkits through the smoke.
Bernice pushed her way through the confused mass of people, looking for Miles or Piper.
Neither was in plain sight.
The Russian botanist Anushkia  Smyslov seemed to be in charge, directing people to clear twisted metal beams from the corridor and check the Base's integrity with air-pressure sensors.
‘Doctor Smyslov, what's happened?
Have you seen the Doctor?
He was in the Conference Room.’
The big Russian shook her head with a marked lack of sympathy.
‘Sensors have confirmed the Conference Room is open to space.
Unless your friend can breathe vacuum, he's dead.
’ She pushed past Bernice.
‘Now if you'll excuse me, I do have a job to do.’
Miles Engado faced west along the bay and watched the sun sinking past the village into a golden haze of spray.
Soon it would be time for the ceremony to begin: for him to walk into the darkened woods and connect his mind to that of the Whale.
To pray for the great creature's cooperation in tomorrow's activity.
The season of the hunt had come again to the people of the North Water.
He walked along the beach, past rows of low cedar huts, his bare feet kicking at the surf which swept in from the north, enjoying the cool water and the tickling sensation of sand being swept between his toes and around his ankles.
Other men of the village were beaching their canoes even as he watched, pulling ashore the dead seals which would ultimately become floats to slow the Whale in the hunt.
Children combed the shoreline for strong shells which the women would sharpen and affix to spears twice the height of a man.
The spears would serve to fish and hunt with, as well as defend the village against competing tribes.
Miles offered up a silent prayer as he walked.
He was lucky to have been born in this particular tribe.
The ocean provided a bountiful supply of fresh food and, together with the forests inland, provided all the raw materials necessary to reap the harvest, as well as jealously guard it.
Miles thought back to his first season as a hunter.
He remembered the heat of the sun on his back, and the way the cold water cleaved at the touch of the canoe, as it was propelled forward in search of prey by the hunters.
He remembered squinting eagerly to catch sight of the basking seals, content and sleepy in the afternoon sunshine, and pointing with excitement when he did.
The other men in the canoe had laughed at his impatience and berated him for pointing.
Everyone knew that to point at the seals was taboo.
Miles had hung his head in shame.
He'd had no wish to wake the seal's and drive them away.
His friend Okawi had signalled to the other canoes by gently shaking his thumb in the direction of the sleeping animals.
Paddles had dipped silently into the water; the canoes sped closer, but the seals had awoken suddenly, and swum away.
Just three seals had been killed that day, when more than twenty were needed; and only one cleanly, by a single spear-thrust from Okawi.
Later, Miles had carved the dead seals' faces on the two killing clubs to honour the animals' sacrifice.
He had never shown impatience or eagerness again.
Miles smiled.
He had been little more than a boy then.
Now he was a man, Chief of his village.
It was his responsibility to convince the Whale to cooperate in the hunt, so the people of the village might be fed and clothed for another season.
He watched as the women of the village — his new wife, Beruna, among them — rushed down to the waterline in their reed skirts.
There they would gut the seals and render their oil, which they would later store in the stomachs and bladders of sea lions.
Moving closer, Miles watched as strips of blubber were placed along with heated stones into canoes filled with water.
The oil floated to the surface and was skimmed away to be used later as a food dip.
He moved slowly along the beach.
Preparations for the hunt seemed to be going well.
Okawi had prepared the hunting canoes and was now praying over their steep sides.
Beruna glared as he walked past to join Okawi, her hands full of seal blubber, a bone knife beside her on the sand.
He knew she was angry with him for allowing their daughter to join the hunt, traditionally something only a  select few men were allowed the honour of, but she would see his way soon enough.
Paula had proved to him she was as able a fisherwoman as any of the men.
And he was Chief, after all.
Perhaps it was time for tradition to change just a little.
He smiled back at Beruna, trying to silently communicate how proud he was, of both her and Paula, but her eyes fell angrily to her work.
Miles looked up.
The topmost edge of the sun was about to dip beyond the North Water.
The sky was cloudless and glowing.
Tomorrow the hunt would begin.
Even now Miles could feel the great Whale approaching, assured of its destiny, its place in the scheme of life.
It was time to pray.
Leaving Okawi and Beruna, Miles turned away from the village and padded silently across the beach to the tree line.
Beyond the first line of trees the forest was shrouded in darkness.
Only the topmost branches were still gilded by daylight, the illuminated areas shrinking as the sun dropped below the misty horizon.
Miles stepped across the threshold and into a different world.
The thunder of the surf became a muted whisper, driven into silence by the rustling of branches and the innumerable calls of night animals, bats and insects.
His feet, still speckled with sand, moved confidently through the undergrowth.
He made no sound: he was one with the land.
Above him, the trees became black silhouettes against a midnight blue sky.
Stars shone thinly.
Miles walked on into the night, to a special place, a secret place, that only he knew.
His praying pool.
There he slipped soundlessly into the cold black water and remained submerged, except for his face, floating easily as the night deepened.
As he swam he dreamed the Whale calm, asking the great creature politely for its cooperation in garnering that which his village needed.
He remembered the words of his grandfather, so many years ago:
‘The Whale always gives our people something.
The Whale always helps someone who needs him.
When you are in the forest, take water at every creek.
Blow it and  start praying while spraying mist from your mouth.
In this way will you grow closer to the Whale.
In this way will it do what you ask of it.’
In his mind the Whale drifted closer through the piebald darkness, and sang:
I have come to see how your house is.
Is it prepared for large crowds?
At the touch of these words, Miles felt calmness leave him.
He knew doubt.
‘Large crowds?’
His grandfather had never mentioned these words.
No Whale in previous seasons had sung these words.
‘Is your house prepared for large crowds?’
Disturbed, Miles swam slowly to the edge of the pool and climbed out of the water.
He stood shivering in the cold air, no longer one with the land, his eyes dim and sightless, his ears blocked to the night sounds, and tried to think.
His house?
Miles moved back through the forest, back towards the beach.
Fires loomed in the night, driving back the darkness.
He moved to his hut.
Beruna.
She was wise.
She would know what his vision meant.
He stooped to enter the hut — and paused.
There were sounds coming from inside.
His wife.
And another.
Another!
Angrily, Miles stepped into the hut.
Beruna stood to face him, blocking his view into the hut.
‘You should not be here.
You should be praying to the Whale.
Without prayers, the Whale will not cooperate in the hunt and the village will starve for lack of food and oil to trade.’
‘I!’
Miles felt a fury boil up within him.
‘I should not be here?
What, then, of this other, skulking in the shadows like a crab?’
Miles moved to pull his wife aside.
Before he could touch her, the concealed figure rose.
‘I am no crab, Miles Engado,’ said Okawi.
‘As you are no Chief, any longer.
Any man who allows his daughter to hunt with warriors does not deserve to lead the tribe.’
‘We will see this tested tomorrow, in the hunt.’
Miles turned and left the hut.
The pursuit began as the sun rose across the bay.
Strong, silent paddling brought three canoes close to the great Whale.
The canoes were loaded with sealskin floats.
Miles stood at one prow, Okawi at another.
Cedar harpoons were clutched in their hands, anchored to the floats by long coils of rope made from cedar bark.
The water was choppy.
Hatred showed in Miles's face.
Jealousy glittered in Okawi's eyes.
The hunters paddling each canoe were terrified.
This was not the way a hunt should be.
Each remembered all too clearly Okawi's parting words before they had pushed each canoe clear of the beach:
‘Beruna will not lie still in her hut for you this day, and so the Whale will thrash about.
She will not face inland, and so the Whale will not swim ashore.
Today she is mine.
Today you will catch no Whale, and I will be Chief.’
And of course— there was Paula, gripping her harpoon in the third canoe.
Miles had remained silent as they had paddled out into the water, though his heart was full of anger and grief.
At first sight of the Whale, he had gripped the harpoon tightly, perhaps wishing it was Okawi's neck.
Fear was in him.
Fear, and betrayal.
Yet the Whale must be caught or else the village would know hardship and death.
Ahead, the Whale breached the surface and blew.
A fountain of stinking saltwater erupted into the air.
Great flukes slapped the ocean with a sound like thunder.
Spray drenched the canoes.
Miles signalled, and the hunters drove on.
as if sensing their approach, the Whale turned and headed away from shore.
Okawi stood in his canoe and yelled triumphantly.
‘I am right, Miles Engado!
I am right!’
Miles called to the hunters to increase their speed.
The canoes shot forward, Paula's drawing level with the Whale's head.
Miles watched as she levelled her harpoon and drew back her arm.
With a triumphant yell, she hurled the harpoon.
It sank into the Whale's glistening  skin just behind its head.
The animal thrashed with the sudden pain, and sounded with a great gout of water tinged with blood.
Once again its flukes slapped the water, and this time the effect was disastrous.
A huge wave swamped the canoes, overturning them and tipping the hunters into the foaming water.
Miles found himself in the water, tangled in coils of rope, battered by sealskin floats.
Paula was floating nearby, blood trickling from a rope burn across her shoulders.
Unable to free himself from the tangle of ropes and floats, Miles swam laboriously across to his daughter.
Just as he reached her, the Whale surged upwards again and Miles was caught by the wave.
He could only watch helplessly as Paula was hurled headfirst into the canoe floating nearby.
There was a sickening crunch, and he lost sight of her ill the swell.
He tried to yell instructions, but water smashed into his face, filling his mouth and nose, suffocating and blinding him.
Then the rope tightened around his body, and he felt something pulling him beneath the surface.
The Whale.
He was caught on the harpoon rope.
Water rushed past his face, growing swiftly darker and colder as he was pulled down.
He tugged uselessly at the ropes, but could not free himself.
His knife was gone, swept away in the confusion.
His chest burned savagely as the ropes bit into his skin.
There was a sudden sharp pain in his ears.
He opened his mouth to scream his anger and pain, and the water rushed in, eager to silence him.
His limbs became heavier, until the effort needed to move them was simply too much.
It grew cold and dark as a winter night, and there was no Beruna to hold him, and no daughter to comfort him, only the rope's cruel embrace, and the Whale's anger.
His last sensation was of pressure waves rippling against his body.
The Whale was…
…screaming as he lurched from his bed, his hands  groping for his throat, his chest heaving convulsively as he fought for air.
He fell to the floor, tangled in a single sheet, thrashing in panic.
The Whale!
Okawi!
His wife was….
She was….
Miles became quite still.
His ancestral village and its myths were three hundred years in the past, and the clear, blue waters of the bay were a sludge of industrial effluent through which thrashed the occasional blinded seabird.
His unfaithful wife was nine years dead.
Only Paula was left to him now.
His face fell and he began to sob as he came fully awake and remembered that even that was no longer true.
Bernice scrambled madly through the twisted wreckage as Anushkia Smyslov lost herself in the chaos, shouting orders.
Tears were driven from her eyes by the smoke.
She pushed past Julie Ndobe, grabbing a medkit from the woman's hands, and running further into the smoke, only to fetch up hard against a metal barrier.
‘No!’
Uselessly, she hammered on the pressure door.
‘Somebody help me get the door open!’
A hand fell on her shoulder.
Bernice spun, grabbing for the body at the end of the arm, not caring who it was.
‘You've got to help me!
We can get him out.
He has a respiratory bypass system, we can —’
‘Bernice, it's too late.’
Teal Green grabbed her shoulders and shook her hard.
‘He's gone.
Gone.’
Bernice gazed stupidly at the engineer.
‘Bullshit!
He's alive !’
‘No.’
‘Christ.
Oh, Christ.’
Bernice pulled away from Teal.
‘I've got to get this sorted out.’
‘Where are you going?’
‘Bishop had the whole place monitored.
I'm going to find out how this happened — and who's responsible.’
Bernice rushed off into the smoke.
Teal moved worriedly after her.
Piper O'Rourke stepped out of the murk behind them, wearing a concerned expression.
She turned on her heel and vanished into the murk.
Bishop tried to block the sound of the explosion from his ears, but couldn't.
He tried to imagine what the inside of the Conference Room would look like now, and found he all too easily could.
He sighed, and reached for his tea.
It had all been so simple until now.
As a child he had lain in bed long into the night, plotting his escape from an alcoholic father and a mother who managed not to see the bruises and the tears.
He studied in every spare moment he could find, not because he wanted to but because, in the absence of parents who would pay, he needed to win a scholarship even to get to school.
He got it.
And he fought every moment of his time at school to keep it.
With no family money or family privilege to protect him, he was easy meat, so he learned how to protect himself.
He learned how to talk his way.
out of trouble and, when that didn't work, how to cripple an opponent in the shortest possible time.
He went from school to college, and he graduated top of his class.
A still, small voice inside him murmured ‘this is all too easy’, but offers flooded in from the combines, the multi-nationals, the companies who had profited from the rape of the Earth, and who were now taking their ecological molestation into space.
He had got himself noticed.
But something inside him, some long-ago echo of a boy beaten into insensibility if he cried, said, no, money isn't everything, satisfaction isn't everything, what about justice?
It was a small man in long, black robes who turned Bishop's life around.
He had engaged Bishop in conversation on the travel belts one day, displaying an uncanny knowledge not only of Bishop's life, but also of his innermost thoughts.
Bishop had known what was happening: the Guild of Adjudicators was famed and feared in equal measure amongst the Earth colonies.
Unconstrained by authority, independent of financial influence, they dispensed their own uncompromising brand of justice across  the galaxy.
Their indirect recruiting methods were legendary.
Bishop didn't take much persuading.
After five years intensive training on the secluded world of Ponten VI — a curious mixture of legal precedent and target practice — Bishop was allowed out in the field as squire to a more experienced Adjudicator.
He found that he enjoyed the work.
More than that, he was good at it.
He moved up through the system rapidly enough to make his mark without looking flashy.
Perhaps, on every promotion, a little voice inside his head muttered, ‘Who are you kidding?
You can't possibly do this job,’ but his cases were always brought to a conclusion in the minimum time and, more importantly, with the minimum expense.
He was dedicated.
His social life didn't suffer, because he didn't have a social life.
Sometimes, in the long reaches of the night, the philosophical difference between what was right and what was just bothered him, but a cup of tea and a good night's sleep usually solved that problem
He never thought about his family.
Eventually, more as a matter of course than as a reward, he was made an Adjudicator; judge, jury and executioner, all rolled into one.
He deserved it, there was no doubt about that, but still something inside him whispered, ‘You're heading for a fall.’
From the messy consequences of the Kroagnon affair to the vraxoin raids off Azure, from the Macra case to the Vega debacle, Bishop's record was immaculate.
Not one failure, not one incorrect prosecution, not a hint of doubt anywhere.
Until now.
Bishop listened to the rolling echoes of the explosion which had destroyed the Conference Room die away deep within the base.
He reached for his tea.
‘I made a fresh pot,’ said a soft voice at his elbow.
‘You, Doctor, might very well have destroyed my career.
The Doctor grinned.
‘That'd be a clever trick for someone who's just been blown up.’
Calmly, he took a sip of  tea.
‘Nice.
But it would taste so much better from a Wedgwood pot.’
Bishop sighed impatiently.
The Doctor set down his beaker.
‘Well, Adjudicator.
Are you ready for the moment of truth?’
Bishop nodded.
‘Neural net,’ he said quietly.
‘Access simularity file one.
Location: Conference Room exterior.
Let's see who the murderer really is.’
The lights went out; all power to the neural net was severed.
Teal Green was coughing up a lungful of smoke when the Base was plunged into darkness.
Immediately, a string of curses echoed down the corridor and there was the sound of someone falling over.
Teal felt his way carefully forward.
His foot thumped against something soft in the darkness.
‘Be careful!
That's me you're kicking!’
‘Bernice?’
‘You were expecting the Isley Brothers?’
‘Who?’
‘Grief, help me up will you?
And what's going on?’
‘Power failure.’
‘How can that happen?’
‘It can't.
All systems are independently monitored by the neural net.’
‘Well, I hate to disagree with you, but —’
‘Yeah, right.
Point taken.
Come on.’
‘Where to?’
‘The backup systems should have kicked in by now.
We must be looking at a general systems failure.
If we don't get life support up and running soon, we'll all suffocate.’
‘Wonderful,’ Bernice said dryly.
‘What do we do first?’
‘Finding a torch would be a good trick.’
Teal groped around the corridor wall.
‘There ought to be a — ah!
Here we go.’
A door opened.
From within the room came the sound of a man sobbing.
‘Miles?’
‘Paula?
I'll be with you soon.
I promise.’
Before they could move, someone pushed past them and shambled off down the corridor.
The Doctor pulled a small torch from his pocket and clicked it on.
The beam was more than adequate to illuminate the non-operational neural net systems.
He tapped a key experimentally, but there was no response.
‘Someone has a positively dramatic sense of timing.’
Bishop drained his beaker of tea.
‘Power failure.’
‘Yes, but what caused it?’
‘More sabotage?’
‘Not unless the saboteur planned to take his own life as well.’
‘Or unless —’
‘The saboteur had already worked out an escape route.’
‘There is another possibility.’
The Doctor nodded.
‘Whoever, or whatever, invaded Moloch Base is now attempting a similar takeover here.’
He led the way to the office door.
‘Come along, Adjudicator.
I rather think your services will shortly be needed in the main airlock.
And your gun.’
Alex Bannen swung the beam of his torch wildly around the Operations Room.
‘Piper?
Are you here?
What the hell is going on?
The power's out all over the base, the temperature is dropping, the air's running out and Mark's gone.
He's just — switched off.’
Piper rose from the MultiCray inputting terminal.
‘I'm doing my best to restore emergency power.
Until the backup generators come on line, I can't get enough ergs to run a full check on the main systems.’
Bannen sighed.
‘For God's sake.
Ask a scientist to do a scientist's job — not an overblown plumber's mate.’
He pushed Piper aside and unclipped a service hatch in the main neural net cabinet.
Piper glared angrily at his bulky silhouette.
If she didn't do something now, he was going to screw everything up.
The Doctor rushed down the corridor, his small feet making virtually no sound on the metal grillework.
Puffing hard, Bishop followed close behind.
Either the corridors were empty of people, or the Doctor had managed to follow a less well-travelled route from Miles's office to the main airlock, several levels below.
With no power to drive the klaxons or the air recyclers, the Base was eerily silent.
Only distant clangs and echo-distorted snatches of conversation drifting along the cross-corridors testified to the tremendous effort being put into restarting the systems.
The Doctor slid to a halt at the inner door to the main airlock.
He tapped quickly at the opening mechanism.
The door remained shut.
‘Odd.
The door's been locked with a command level override.’
Bishop frowned in the darkness.
‘Only Miles Engado has that clearance.’
The Doctor cleared his throat.
‘Ahem.
Well, actually….’
He tapped out another rapid series of digits and the lock disengaged.
The Doctor grabbed the manual locking wheel and began to spin it rapidly.
Hydraulic pressure built up slowly until the door wheezed open.
Umbrella held high, the Doctor led the way into the chamber.
There were clanking noises coming from further within.
He shone his torch around the chamber.
‘Miles?
Miles Engado?
We know you're in here….’
There was a hollow clunk, and the rising whine of power.
Ten metres away, lights bloomed in the darkness.
Bishop drew his gun.
‘Miles Engado, I am arresting you for the —’
‘Miles, no!’
The Doctor rushed forward, but was too late to prevent Miles latching down his helmet and powering up the starsuit.
Warning lights flashed on the suit's shoulders as it lumbered slowly to the airlock outer door.
One servo-driven arm reached out to grip the door's locking wheel.
‘Get out!’ the Doctor called, running back towards the inner door.
After a moment's hesitation, Bishop followed.
The locking wheel turned.
The door began to open.
‘All the failsafes are power driven — if we don't get out the whole section will depressurize!’
Air began to whistle out of the airlock.
Together, the Doctor and Bishop scrambled through the inner door against the mounting pressure of air.
The Doctor swung himself round the door and gripped the locking wheel.
The door slid shut as the wheel spun.
The air-scream ceased.
Bishop holstered his gun.
A light bobbed up and down further along the corridor, accompanied by the sound of running footsteps.
Bernice and Teal halted breathlessly beside the Doctor and Bishop.
‘Doctor!
My God, you are alive!’
Bernice said, stunned.
The Doctor found a second to doff his hat.
‘It's Miles, we have to stop him,’ she said.
‘He is responsible for the sabotage on the Base and he has implicated himself by trying to escape,’ Bishop said harshly.
‘No, you don't understand.’
Teal waved-a piece of paper under Bishop's nose.
‘We found this in his quarters.
It's a suicide note.
He's not trying to escape; he's trying to kill himself.’
‘Then who's responsible for all this?’
There was a groan from the darkness, and Alex Bannen stumbled into the splash of light made by the torches.
He raised one hand to the back of his head; his fingers came away stained with blood.
‘Piper.
It's bloody Piper.
She brained me when I tried to reboot the neural net.’
He fell to the floor with a groan, blood pooling around his head.
Kreig was counting her ears again.
‘Thirty-eight,’ Ardamal prompted from the far side of the squalid, duralinium-lined bunkroom.
‘You had thirty eight yesterday morning, and thirty-eight last night.
‘Less there's someone woke up today hard of hearing, there's thirty-eight there now.’
Kreig looked up, an ear held delicately in her hand like some alien flower.
‘You trying to make a point?’ she snarled.
‘Just wondering.’
‘Wondering what?’
‘Why you keep counting.’
‘Case some dumb-ass tries to steal one.’
‘Yeah, stupid of me,’ Ardamal muttered, as Kreig wrapped the ear in soft plastic, placed it gently back in its box, and picked another out.
Dommer had been following the exchange from his bunk, where he was obsessively stripping and reassembling his flamer.
‘How many d'you get in that last action?’ he asked.
His throat had been badly scarred by praxis gas during a bankruptcy action three years ago, and his words came out sounding like fingernails scratching glass.
‘Come on, Dommer,’ Ardamal said.
‘You know her rules.
One every time.
Like a keepsake.
For luck.’
Dommer laughed.
‘Yeah,’ he said.
‘Beats hell out'a crappy tourist gifts.’
His fingers idly stroked the oiled metal of his exposed weapon.
Kreig wasn't listening.
Her deeply lined face was creased into a smile as she gazed at the tiny ear in her hand.
‘Asset-stripping InterSpace Incorporated, back in Tokyo in fifty-six,’ she whispered.
Her face was radiant.
‘Tiny kid, daughter of the Chairman.
We Zed-bombed the barriers and went in with shielded skimmers.
Corporate lawyers went in under our covering fire to deliver the paperwork.’
She turned the ear until Ardamal could see the crust of blood beneath it.
‘They wanted the Chairman's retinal print for the waiver forms,’ she continued.
‘Didn't.say nothing about wanting the rest of him, though.
And I got his kid.’
‘I remember Tokyo,’ said Dommer, and laughed.
‘Had a good time, and Jeez, the bonuses!
Those shares're still paying off better'n the regular paycheck.’
‘I thought you was on the InterSpace payroll back then?’
Ardamal growled.
‘Yeah, but I got head-hunted.
IMC bought out my contract.
I've spent thirty years as a Company Shock Trooper, and IMC's the best thing that ever happened to me.
I mean, take this last action.
Nobody firing back, and we still get a percentage of the profits.
Just a turkey shoot, that's all it was.’
His voice was beginning to grate on Ardamal.
‘Had myself a nice piece of Scottish ass, though,’ Dommer reminisced with a gap-toothed smile.
‘Wildcat, that one.’
He ran a hand over the parallel scratches down his cheek.
‘Had to give her a good talking to.’
He fondled the scorched barrel of the flamer.
‘A good talking to.’
‘No cover,’ Ardamal said, just to shut Dommer up.
‘Be thankful nobody was firing back.
The way the ground just curled up at the edges until you lost sight of it, we couldn't have crept up on a hunk of soya.’
‘Yeah.’
Dommer had reassembled his flamer now, and was checking the calibration on the sights by centring the laser marker on Kreig's temple.
‘That was kinda —’
The alert sirens screamed.
Three sets of boots hit the floor.
‘All crew to stations ,’ the tannoy rasped.
‘Escaped prisoner.
Repeat; escaped prisoner.
Amber alert.
Repeat; amber alert.
Troops one to seventeen adopt search pattern spiral delta.
This is not an exercise.
Repeat; this is not an exercise .’
Ardamal just beat Kreig out of the door, while Dommer was still fumbling with his flamer.
The last thing Ardamal heard as he raced down the corridor was the tinkle of metal parts hitting the floor.
As he leaped for the null-grav shaft, he caught sight of the prisoner thrashing through the air two storeys above.
Her pony-tail was weaving like a snake, and she was still dressed in blood-stained black armour and shiny leggings; the same kit that she had been wearing when Ardamal and his section had dragged her, kicking and screaming, into the IMC executive transporter.
This time she had a gun.
Ardamal twisted lithely, presenting the smallest possible surface area to the woman whilst simultaneously lining up his needler on her left breast.
‘Body shots are best,’ he heard the long-ago voice of Sergeant Cribb saying, back at the IMC training camp, as he demonstrated various weapons and aiming techniques on a row of terrified ElleryCorp prisoners.
‘If you miss the heart, you might still put a hole through something vital.
If you miss the head, you've missed them completely.’
Kreig swam to one side, hugging the walls, boosting her speed with handholds and seams, trying to overtake the woman and pin her between exits.
Textbook stuff.
The woman was drifting upwards now; trying to read exit signs whilst still watching for pursuit.
Klaxons echoed up and down the shaft.
The peculiar properties of air under null-grav conditions added an extra resonance to the noise.
Kreig passed the woman without a sound, without a breeze, climbing like a rocket to Exit 347, where she hung, waiting for the woman and Ardamal to catch up.
Ardamal manoeuvred himself to a position below and slightly behind the woman, hidden by her legs.
As his needler's laser marker passed across her back, he pressed the compensation stud.
Micro-gyros kicked in, stabilizing  the bright dot on the base of her spine.
Somewhere in the back of his mind was the knowledge that Legion wanted the woman kept alive, but the sight of Kreig's ears had given Ardamal a thirst, and he needed to slake it.
The needler felt like it was locked in space.
He took up the trigger pressure.
Body shots are best.
‘Ard’ old buddy, where's the…
Shit!’
Dommer had come flailing into the shaft below Ardamal.
He caught sight of the woman at the same time she heard him.
Her eyes widened.
Dommer swung his flamer up to cover her as she twisted her handgun around.
She hadn't trained in null-grav, that much was obvious.
Her body spun in the opposite direction to her gun as she fired, conserving angular momentum and throwing her aim completely off.
Energy flashed past Ardamal in a long arc of fire, blistering the side of the shaft, missing his face by less than half a metre.
Dommer, chanting some kind of battle hymn, fired.
His incompletely assembled weapon exploded, smothering his head, arms and shoulders in a mass of flames.
Screaming, he cartwheeled into the side of the shaft and rebounded, leaving a smear of grease and soot.
The smell of roasting flesh drifted up the shaft.
Ardamal ignored the distraction and took careful aim again.
The prisoner was trying to stabilize her spin, and failing.
There was no fear in her eyes: only hatred, and the knowledge that she could never, ever die.
He pulled the trigger.
The space where she had been was obliterated in a flash of hard radiation.
When the blaze cleared, there was nothing.
For hours the planet had grown no larger in Miles Engado's faceplate; seeming instead to retreat as he fell towards it.
Lucifer was indifferent to him.
It tolerated his advance, but would make no concessions.
He berated it, screaming out his rage and his fear until his voice was a  croak, and small droplets of sweat and spittle hung about his face.
It made no difference.
Lucifer did not hear him.
Or, if it did, it paid him no heed.
Drained by his ranting and lulled by the way he could float in the starsuit, just touching the padded interior, he drifted into and out of sleep like a man wandering through the rooms of an empty house.
His dreams were short and violent, punctuated by images of a vast, barnacle-encrusted shape which drifted disdainfully away as he swam towards it.
When he finally surfaced, his mouth stale and his eyes hot and gritty, Lucifer's atmosphere had already enfolded him like a shroud.
He twisted his head to look upwards, but Moloch was just a faint disc half hidden by the clouds: a burnished coin beneath polluted water.
He floundered in panic as, for a brief moment, he could not remember why he was there.
He knew that he had written a note explaining everything, but the note was back on Belial and he had forgotten its contents.
Had he said that he was going to his death in Lucifer's inferno?
Had he written about the great hunt, the rites of the warriors?
It was all so far away now.
There was only him, and the clouds, and the hidden face of Lucifer.
He was not falling.
Rather: thin muslin sheets of brown and red were being pulled past his eyes, patterned like the blankets woven by the women, patterned like the rug that hung on the wall in his daughter's room.
Shadows drifted past him like fronds, dappled with refracted sunlight, tied with thin streams of bubbles as he sank slowly into the welcoming depths of the ocean, under the incurious eye of the great Whale….
When he awoke again, it was with a pounding headache.
The starsuit was hotter now; the heat of re-entry and the energy of Lucifer's interior triumphing over the best human life support technology.
His sweat had floated from him whilst he slept, and whilst he fell, overwhelming the humidity regulators, pooling in the extremities of the starsuit and soaking into the padding.
The atmosphere had closed in: now it was as if a clumsy child had finger-painted  amorphous swirls and blobs in dull colours over faceplate.
His thoughts were clearer now.
Perhaps the heat had given his mind the boost it needed to throw off the dream world that had gradually surrounded him since Paula's fall into the maw of the Beast.
He remembered the note.
He remembered writing of Paula's death,— of how he could not live without knowing the truth, and how, if he gave himself into the hands of the great Whale, he knew that he would be reunited with her in death.
He remembered wanting to write a farewell to Piper.
He wondered if he had.
Miles shook his head wearily.
Project Eden had eaten five years of his life, and spat them back at him, empty of meaning.
There had been no contact with the Angels; there would be no power source for Earth.
He had failed his race as he had failed his family.
The indicators were beginning to flicker hesitantly, reminding him of his foolishness.
He was a stupid old man who deserved to die.
Like his wife.
Like his daughter.
He prepared to give himself over to whatever fate Lucifer had in store for him.
And that was why, when Paula's face swam out of the murky clouds and peered incuriously at him, Miles Engado screamed.
The room was warm and inviting, like a gentleman's club, the lounge bar in her local back in Perivale.
It engendered immediate feelings of friendship, of belonging.
For the first time since Heaven, Ace thought of Julian, and the times they had sat in worn green leather armchairs, the hum of traffic from the A40 outside making waves in their glasses, knowing that the barman thought they were underage but also knowing that Ace intimidated him so much that he wouldn't say anything.
This room was like that: oak panelled, plushly carpeted, lined with portraits, slightly musty.
The chandeliers floating near the ceiling were a touch ornate for her taste, but she liked the huge wooden table stacked up with what looked like real fruit.
After so long eating recycled meals on Belial, her salivary glands sprang into life with sharp little pangs of anticipation.
It was entirely inappropriate, but she couldn't help herself.
Moloch seemed so long ago.
And there was something else in the room with her.
She turned slowly, ready for action.
Whatever it was, it vanished as she turned.
She caught sight of a movement out of the corner of her eye, whirled, but was too late to see anything.
She was alone.
Bugger this for a game of soldiers, she thought, and opened her mouth to speak.
‘I must apologize for my staff.
Their actions can be precipitate.’
The voice surprised her.
Or was it voices?
Bass, tenor, alto and soprano; the words seemed to glide up and down the scale from moment to moment with no consistency.
Their direction seemed to change as well.
It was almost as if she was surrounded by a choir, with each person allocated one word, but so well rehearsed that the sentences flowed seamlessly along.
‘Precipitate!’
Ace snarled.
‘Your ‘staff’ killed my friends.
I don't care what fancy words you use, I call it murder!’
She waved her weapon menacingly.
Whatever vanishing act had saved her from the goon with the gun, it had left her armed.
Foolish, very foolish.
There was a laugh from behind her.
Ace snapped around, priming the weapon as she moved.
The laugh curled around her, beginning as a soft chuckle, evolving through a deep guffaw, and ending as a childlike giggle, once more behind her.
Her lips thinned.
Her finger slipped inside the weapon's trigger guard.
‘I'm warning you.
Stop taking the piss.’
‘The Terrestrial sense of humour,’ said the voice.
‘There's nothing quite like it anywhere else in the cosmos.’
Ace frowned.
She'd intended to appear threatening, not amusing.
‘Yes, I'm afraid they're ruined,’ the voice continued, as if engaged in a different conversation.
‘Perhaps you would like to slip into something more comfortable.’
Ace frowned.
What was going on here?
The conversation was hopping all over the place like a dakkabug on a griddle.
‘Albert, the master of witty repartee, says ‘Piss off’,’ she retorted, finally finding a use for the punchline of the worst joke she'd ever been told.
A whiff of burned material caught her attention.
She glanced down, trying to trace the source of the smell, and suddenly noticed that her leggings were scorched and her polycarbide armour was blistered and smoking, its structural integrity ruined.
‘Oh sod,’ she said.
‘I'd just worn them in, as well.’
‘Ah, no, your friends are not dead,’ the voice said.
For a moment, it was a child's voice, just behind her shoulder, but then it was old, and quavery-y, and a million miles away.
‘No, merely anaesthetized.
I have them under medical supervision.’
Ace frowned.
She remembered….
…
A spray of warmth across her face….
A flash of light….
Shadowy figures emerging from a doorway with weapons raised….
Hands grabbing her and pulling her down….
Rachel and Chas sprawled in undignified positions on the floor….
Lars screaming and falling….
A hypogun….
A coldness spreading across her shoulders and racing through her limbs….
The long fall into darkness ….
She supposed it was possible that they weren't all dead.
She suddenly found it much easier to breathe.
There had been too much death already in her life.
She wanted to believe that her friends were still alive.
But — it didn't quite make sense.
The weight hovered over her shoulders, ready to settle.
Her finger tightened on the trigger.
‘Why am I awake and pissed off, then?’ she started to ask, but the voice interrupted her before the ‘awake’was complete.
‘Your constitution is strong, for a human,’ it said.
‘You  fought off the effects of the anaesthetic faster than my medical orderly thought possible.’
It made a strange sort of sense.
She remembered waking up in a long room filled with covered beds; knocking a uniformed man to the ground; taking his gun and running.
She felt disoriented: like Alice in Wonderland, everything seemed to be arse-about-face.
‘All around you,’ said the voice suddenly.
‘Where are you?’
Ace snapped, and stopped, taken aback.
‘No, I can't,’ the voice continued.
‘Can you read my…?’
She bit off the sentence, waiting for the voice to continue.
Not a sound.
She opened her mouth experimentally.
Nothing.
‘If you can't —’ she said quickly, and stopped.
Nothing.
‘— read my mind, then how could you answer my questions before I had a chance to ask them?’ she gabbled, and took a deep breath.
‘How embarrassing,’ the voice said.
‘I appear to be slightly out of synchronization.
My apologies.’
A fleshy black shape swelled up from nothing in front of her.
Thin tendrils spilled from it and trailed to the floor.
Beside her another, squatter, shape appeared, its tendrils quivering restlessly.
Above her head, a pancake-shaped mass of blue flesh slowly spun.
Something moved down by her feet.
She took a quick step backwards.
The thing stayed where it was: a small, grey, pear shape made of some doughy material.
Ace raised her stolen gun, unsure which of the things to aim at.
Her fingers gripped thin air.
The gun had vanished from her hand.
‘Allow me to introduce myself,’ the voice said.
The grey ovoid pulsed in time with the words.
‘My name is Legion, and I am acting captain of the Interstellar Mining Corporation vessel Insider Trading .’
Tendrils from the two black shapes reached out to entwine with each other, pulling their cores closer together until, as Ace watched in amazement, they melded together into a single muscular column of flesh crowned with thorns.
‘Bloody hell,’ she said.
‘Why didn't you say so earlier?
I've been trying to find you for ages.’
They fell together, father and daughter, through the poisonous atmosphere of Lucifer.
Father and daughter and something else.
‘You're alive.’
Miles whispered.
He felt sick with joy.
His tears floated from his eyes and star-splashed perfectly against his faceplate, one by one.
‘You're alive!’
Paula was not the daughter he remembered.
She had undergone a sea-change into something rich and strange down in the depths of Lucifer.
The great Whale had turned its terrible gaze upon her, transfiguring her once-smooth skin into sheets of light which hid deeper firefly gleams, like the Northern Lights back on Earth.
And yet he recognized her.
‘Dad?’
He heard her voice in his head.
‘Dad, you shouldn't have come —’
‘I had to.
The Angels saved you.
They care .
They want to help us.’
‘They didn't save me.’
The pain in her voice cut him deeply.
‘I was dying, and so was one of them….
There was a connection….
Somehow, we drew strength from each other, enough to stave off death for a little while longer.
We joined, but the joining can't last.
Our time has come.
We've been waiting for you.
We had to tell you….’
His throat was tight, and his mouth was twisted out of shape by grief.
‘Tell me what?’
‘To leave.
Get everybody out of Belial and Moloch now, before it's too late.’
‘And walk away from the best chance we've had in years to complete the mission?’
He felt a wave of exasperation rise within him.
‘Don't you understand?
The Project  will finally be able to work!
You can translate for us, human to Angel, Angel to human.
You'll be the saviour of the Earth.’
‘You haven't been listening to us.
We can't save anyone.
We're dying.
We can feel the pull of the core, dragging us down, forcing the last change upon us —’
‘There must be a way you can help us communicate with them.
If there's just one thing you can tell me, one clue to how they think —’
‘You were the same when Mum died,’ she wailed.
‘She wanted to tell you so many things, but you were too busy talking to listen.
She needed to know that you loved her; so you told her all about the new drugs she could get from the Arcturans, or the huge advances in radiation treatment since rho mesons had been discovered.
She didn't want any more pain, she wanted to be held.
You never told her that you loved her .’
‘Do you blame me?
After what she did?’
His voice was quiet and bitter.
Her silence was answer enough.
He closed his eyes for a minute.
When he opened them, he had an audience.
Paula was floating in the centre of a circle of Angels.
They hung before him; swirling, shifting, changing, somehow moving whilst staying perfectly still; their bodies evolving like glowing patterns in a three-dimensional kaleidoscope.
‘They want you to go,’ Paula said without words.
Her voice bubbled and changed like her body.
‘We want you to go.’
‘You don't understand,’ he cried.
‘My whole life has led me to this point.
To here.
You can't tell me it's for nothing.
Nobody can.
I won't hear that!
Paula.
I love you.
I want — need — answers!’
‘I don't have any for you, Dad.
I'm sorry.’
The uniform fitted Ace perfectly.
It wasn't as sophisticated as the one she had worn whilst attached to IMC during the Dalek Wars, three hundred years in the future, but  it brought back memories of belonging, of finally being accepted on her own terms by a group of her peers.
She looked over at the pile of burned clothing she had shed like a snake's skin, and shuddered.
It was a mistake to go back, she thought.
I've outgrown the Doctor now.
He needs me more than I need him.
My future lies elsewhere.
Legion was seated at the head of the table, and to either side of her, and floated up near the ceiling.
One of the black, tendrilled parts of its body was picking apart an orange and ingesting it, segment by segment.
The grey ovoid, some distance away, expanded and contracted in a movement which reminded Ace of nothing so much as chewing, although there was no way that she could see whereby the fruit could have been transmitted from one part of Legion to another.
‘This is probably a stupid question,’ Ace said from her position at the foot of the table, reaching out for another piece of fruit, ‘but are all these bits you, or what?’
‘I see you have noticed a certain peculiarity about my appearance.’
‘No shit?’ she said, straightfaced.
Ace could sense a sudden chilliness in Legion's manner.
The various parts of its body strained towards each other and collected into a hairy spherical fragment balanced on three pipe-cleaner legs at the head of the table.
‘I will not tolerate disrespect!’
‘Sorry, Captain,’ she snapped automatically.
She sat up a little straighter and resolved to regard her host with more of an open mind.
Legion was obviously intelligent, and deserved to be treated as such.
‘Very well,’ Legion continued.
‘I am not human, as you are.’
It paused, obviously expecting some kind of shocked reaction.
Ace nodded, saying nothing.
‘Whereas the lives of humans, and other linear races in the cosmos, are constrained to four dimensions, we are privileged to move through seven.’
‘There aren't seven dimensions,’ Ace exclaimed, and then added, ‘are there?’
‘The space-time continuum has eleven dimensions,’ Legion replied, ‘although four of them are inaccessible.’
‘So, what's it like then, living in seven dimensions?’
She took another bite of fruit.
Legion did not reply.
‘Legion?’
‘Indescribable.’
‘Nice one!’
‘But imagine, if you are able, watching small creatures floating on the surface of a pond.
Imagine that these creatures cannot look up or down, but only across the water itself.
They are not aware of the air, or the depths.
Their world is flat.’
As it talked, Legion's voice changed.
The various elements combined until it seemed to Ace that a choir was whispering to her.
‘You reach down from your exalted position, beyond their understanding, and put your — the things on the ends of your forelimbs….’
‘Fingers.’
‘…fingers into the water.
What do these creatures see?’
After a few seconds, Ace realized that this was not a rhetorical question.
‘Er….
My fingers?’
‘No, because your fingers exist in three dimensions, and they can only perceive two.
They see….’
It paused.
‘How many — fingers — do you possess?’
Ace held up a hand.
‘And is that normal for your species?’
Legion asked.
‘You don't pay much attention to your staff, do you?’
‘I have more important considerations.’
‘Yes.
Five fingers on each hand, if you include the thumbs.’
‘Thumbs?’
‘Never mind.’
‘Then these creatures see five discs suddenly appear in the water.
As far as they are concerned, these discs are five separate entities.
Why should they associate them  with each other?
But if you plunge your hand deeper into the water, up to the — the hinge section….’
‘The wrist.’
‘Up to the wrist, then the creatures who inhabit the surface of the water will see the five discs suddenly merge into one large ellipse.
Do you understand?’
Ace had actually understood some time ago, but if there was one lesson that she would take away gladly from her time with the Doctor, it was that it was better to have people underestimate your abilities than overestimate them.
‘I think so,’ she said cautiously.
‘And if you pick one of these creatures up and place it a little distance away on the surface of the water, all its fellows will see is that it vanished, and reappeared elsewhere.
Neither they, nor it, can see the air through which it moved.
Do you understand?’
‘Uh-huh.’
‘What you see of me,’ and the hairy, three-legged blob standing at the front of the table stretched like hot toffee and broke apart into fifteen warty blue spheres which bounced, very slowly, between the floor and the ceiling, ‘is merely a three-dimensional cross-section of a seven-dimensional shape.
As my body moves in and out of your perception, you see different aspects of it.
Your three-dimensional brain is not capable of appreciating the beauty of my true body.’
Ace was fascinated.
‘So all I can see are your fingers, your toes and your naughty bits?’
The spheres coalesced into a black and vaguely hairy shape that threatened to develop three thin and multi-jointed legs.
Ace was beginning to get the message.
‘I apologize, Captain,’ she said formally.
Best to get on its good side.
‘And so when our conversation was out of sync before —’
‘What you call time is a dimension, like any other,’ Legion said casually.
‘I tend to drift around in it, if I am not concentrating.
Sometimes I answer questions that you  will ask in a while, sometimes I respond to queries from moments ago.
‘Well wicked!’
Ace said.
‘But what are you doing working for IMC?
You could wipe the floor with them.’
‘My race has no interest in power,’ Legion replied haughtily.
‘A mere three dimensions is nothing.
I may as well offer you complete control over the direction east.’
‘But why bother working for a scurvy Earth company, then?’
‘You ask a lot of questions.’
‘You're not wrong.’
‘I am under contract.
Our respective worlds have only recently met.
We have certain technologies that humanity lacks, but we in turn lack — protection.
IMC have offered us weapons in return for specialist help.
I am that specialist.’
‘But what do you need the protection from?’
A shudder seemed to run through the various sections of Legion's disconnected bulk.
‘There are dark forces in the universe before whom we are powerless.
I can say no more.’
Ace thought for a moment.
‘Okay then, what is IMC doing in the Lucifer system?’
‘Ah,’ said Legion, ‘you humans and your obsession with business affairs.
We have come across other species like you — the Cimliss, the Usurians, the Okk.
Always worrying about the indefinable moment.
To put it simply: your Earth Government has declared bankruptcy.
Its affairs, its goods and its chattels have been put in the hands of the receivers.’
Ace pushed aside a feeling of dread.
‘And who are these receivers?’ she asked.
‘Something called the Earth Alliance of Corporations; a collection of the most powerful companies and conglomerates which trade off-Earth.
You may know it better as the Holding Company.’
‘And IMC?’
She already knew the answer.
‘We get the mineral rights,’ Legion said, almost happily, ‘of all subcontracted colonies.
Like Eden.’
The medlab on the IMCV Insider Trading was large, high-tech and as soulless as a plaster saint.
Legion led Ace into it with a certain swagger, if a green balloon trailing pink strands could be said to swagger.
A medical orderly bustled towards them.
He gestured towards the first of a long row of recuperation pods, where Christine LaFayette's face was visible through a clear plastic window.
She looked to Ace like a frozen corpse.
‘Trauma and some tissue damage,’ he said, snapping to attention as Ace peered into the pod.
Ace absentmindedly returned a sketchy salute.
Old habits die hard, she thought.
‘Cost?’
Captain Legion asked in a host of voices.
‘With immediate treatment, plus physiotherapy, psychotherapy and prosthetics, the estimate is thirty thousand adjusted ergs, Captain.’
‘Charge it to my account,’ Legion said.
Ace moved to the next pod, anxious to find her friends from Moloch.
She recognized the face of one of her attackers beneath a layer of blue gel.
His face was burned right down to the bone in places, and one eye had curdled into a white lump.
‘Faulty weapon discharge, Ma'am,’ the orderly explained.
He had obviously mistaken Ace for one of the regular crew, and she did not bother to correct him.
‘Third-degree burns over most of the face and neck.
Seventy per cent flesh reduction on hands and arms.
Left radius and ulna suffered heat recrystallization and associated brittleness.’
‘Cost?’
Legion asked from behind them.
‘The reconstructive surgery is fairly basic.
If standard EB Corporation ocular replacements are used instead of cloned organs the estimate is only nineteen thousand adjusted ergs.’
There was a pause.
‘Too much,’ Legion said.
‘Terminate treatment.’
Ace stepped towards the next pod.
‘No time for that,’ Legion barked, and its tone made Ace automatically stop and stand to attention.
Part of her  was appalled at the ease with which she had slotted straight back into the military lifestyle; part of her welcomed the safety of knowing exactly where she fitted in and what she was supposed to do.
‘You can visit them later,’ Legion said.
‘For now, attend me.’
It moved towards the door, aspect changing moment by moment.
Ace followed, casting a last glance back over her shoulder into the medlab.
When it was clear that IMC's newest recruit would not turn back, a grossly fat woman stepped from a side room.
‘For an alien, Legion certainly knows which buttons to push.’
The orderly shrugged as he went about his task of switching off Company Shock Trooper (Third Class) Jason Curtis Dommer's life support machine.
‘Have you heard the scuttlebut about her?
Apparently, she typed a message into the Belial Base neural net, right where the viruses that Legion's agent planted there would find it and transmit it back here.’
‘A message?’ the woman asked, jowls quivering.
‘Just Legion's name, and the words: ‘We must meet’.’
‘Very cryptic.’
‘Yeah.
Trouble is, Legion's agent spotted it, thought she'd been rumbled, knocked the girl senseless and deleted the message.’
‘So she knew Legion was here?’
The orderly glanced up, his face underlit by the row of tell-tales along Dommer's pod.
‘Yeah, but the word is that she didn't realize IMC sent a whole fleet.
She thought Legion was working alone.
When Dommer and the others burst in, she freaked.
Lucky she's still alive.’
He flicked a last switch, and Jason Dommer slid unknowingly from life into death.
‘Aren't we all?’
Bronwen ap Bryn said, as she stroked her tattooed scalp thoughtfully and turned to leave the sick-bay.
Piper O'Rourke used her hand to shield the beam of her torch as she crept along the darkened corridors of Belial Base towards the main airlock.
The cold light silhouetted the bones of her hand like an X-ray.
Part of her wanted to stop and stare, entranced by the sight: the rest of her screamed silently in the darkness.
She was losing it.
She was losing it .
She stopped and rested her forehead against the cold metal walls of the corridor.
Keep it together, Piper, and you might still get out of this alive.
She lifted a hand to her face and wiped away a greasy sheen of sweat.
Although it was cold and the air was running out, she was burning up.
Burning up.
Paula.
Oh, Christ.
Sucking in a lungful of cold air, Piper moved once more down the corridor.
She only had to make it to the airlock, seal the inner door behind her and wait….
Wait as Paula had waited, as Earth was waiting….
For IMC to help.
Piper stopped, suddenly, twenty metres short of the airlock.
Sounds echoed out of the darkness towards her.
Voices.
‘You don't understand….
He's trying to kill himself!’
‘Then who's responsible for all this?’
‘…
Bloody Piper.
She brained me when I tried to reboot the neural net!’
More voices, speaking in hurried whispers.
Bannen, whom she'd left in the Operations Room, supposedly  wracked with grief over the abrupt crash of the simularity of his son.
Damn his thick skull: she should have splashed his brains across the wall.
Bishop.
Teal.
Bernice.
The Doctor.
But that was impossible!
She'd killed him.
Piper groaned inwardly.
They knew.
They'd tricked her, and they knew.
She'd even given them the evidence herself.
Fool!
Piper ran a hand through her hair.
Her torch flickered across the wall and she switched it off, holding her breath in case someone had noticed the distant gleam of light.
Nothing.
The pitch of the voices did not change.
They didn't know she was there.
There might still be a chance of escape.
As silently as she could, Piper backed away from the airlock, into the darkness.
And a light silhouetted her against the wall.
Her body suddenly became numb.
An icy sensation rushed through her limbs.
Her heart faltered, then resumed its steady rhythm.
She gasped, clutched her chest and sank to the metal grillework which served as the floor of the corridor.
Her head spun and her left arm tingled painfully with pins and needles.
She blinked.
The light was shining in her eyes, swooping towards her.
Something simultaneously velvet and diamond insinuated itself into her body, slipping easily between the molecules of her skin and coalescing within her.
Piper screamed.
The sensation moved around inside her, filling her up, shuffling, searching, passing through to leave her sick and trembling and curiously empty.
The light faded, driven aside by the darkness of the Base.
She heard footsteps: people running towards her, attracted by her scream.
She struggled to her feet, her only thought to avoid discovery, and staggered off into the darkness.
Bernice ran forward into the darkness, her torch beam  bobbing in front of her.
A babble of conversation filled her ears.
‘What was it?
Did you see it?’
‘See what?
I heard a noise, like a whisper —’
‘There was something — a light, shadows —’
‘How can you see shadows?
It's dark!’
‘What the hell — there's someone there!’
‘Hey!
Hey you!’
Teal's hand found her arm.
‘Don't.
Bernice, don't go any further.’
‘But I have to see —’
‘No.’
The Doctor's voice rang out like a ship's bell in the darkness.
‘You don't have to see anything.
Come back here, now.
All of you.’
The running footsteps faltered, slowed, began to return along the corridor.
The Doctor shone his torch on to Bernice as she returned from the darkness.
Her face was flushed with excitement.
‘Did you see it?
What was it?’
Beside her, Teal's voice trembled in the darkness.
‘There was nothing to see.
I only heard….’
He faltered.
‘I only heard….’
The Doctor spoke firmly.
‘Get everyone together.
Anushkia, Julie, Craig….
Get them all and meet me in the Operations Room.
Bernice, Bishop: carry Alex will you.
And mind you go carefully with his head.
We'll need him to get the neural network back on line.’
Without another word, the Doctor strode into the darkness.
Bernice stared distastefully at the physicist, recumbent on the floor.
‘Come on then, Sleeping Beauty.’
Christine LaFayette blinked a layer of viscous blue gel from her eyes and sat up, coughing.
‘Ciel!’
She coughed again, and spat a wad of blue gel to one side.
Her throat stung with the effort.
She tried to massage her neck but her left arm would not move.
She peered down at it, noting that a white smock, like a hospital gown, clothed her from throat to ankles.
Projecting beyond the sleeve, the flesh of her hand was pallid and  sweaty.
It hung uselessly at her side.
She rolled up the sleeve to her elbow, the fingers of her right hand brushing her left forearm as she did so.
She felt nothing.
She pinched herself, but might as well have been pinching the padded plastic of the bed on which she sat for all the sensation she felt.
She rolled her sleeve up further.
Above her elbow, the flesh displayed a normal skin tone.
A razor-sharp line divided the quick from the newly grown.
She pinched herself on her left biceps and yelped with pain.
As the pain subsided, she looked around.
She was sitting on a diagnostic bed in what was obviously a medlab of some kind.
But where?
There was no equipment this sophisticated anywhere on Eden.
Straining, she tried to gather her thoughts.
The last thing she remembered was….
Yukio's face erupting before her, stumbling backwards, a pressure on her elbow.
My arm!
Is that my arm?
Why is it floating in front of And then the pain, and the darkness.
And then here.
Wherever here was.
Feeling her stomach churn with the painful memories, she leaned sideways and was violently sick.
Something metallic slithered from beneath her bed and vacuumed the debris away, before slipping back under the bed and deactivating with a click.
Medical droid.
Not on the Base, then.
Not anywhere on the Base.
Painfully, Christine swung her legs to one side until she was in a sitting position.
Her muscles were a little stiff, but, although she flinched in anticipation, there was no pain.
She glanced down again at her left arm.
Prosthetic?
Cloned?
Easier to believe that it was hers, and there was something wrong with it.
Damn the memories of seeing it floating away in front of her.
Nerve damage, say, or muscle wastage.
Something.
Anything.
She ran her right hand lightly over the rest of her body.
Everything seemed fine.
She took a deep breath.
Time to leave then, and find some answers.
Peering around for a locker where she might find some clothes, she stood.
A medical alarm sounded.
Bernice helped Bishop lay Alex Bannen on the floor beside one of the main Operations Room workstations.
There was a loud clattering and muted conversation as Anushkia Smyslov, Shmuel Zehavi and a morose Cheryl Russell followed them into the room and placed their torches so that the beams played over the domed ceiling, throwing a dim reflected light, like candlelight, back into the room.
Bernice stood.
‘Anyone here got med training?’
Anushkia pushed forward into the circle of torchlight.
‘Yes.
I'll take charge here.
You and Teal go and find Craig Richards and Tiw Heimdall.’
‘I'll find the Doctor,’ Cheryl said dully, as she picked up a torch.
‘Craig's probably checking the power linkages.
God alone knows where we'll find Tiw.’
Bernice nodded.
‘Let's do it.’
Bishop stepped forward as the women left the room;
Anushkia looked up from beside Alex Bannen's prone body.
‘And where are you going?’
‘Orders to the contrary notwithstanding, Krau Smyslov,’ Bishop produced his ubiquitous thin smile, ‘to apprehend the villain of the piece.’
The Doctor ran soundlessly through the darkness.
He had no torch, but darkness did not impede his progress.
In the back of his mind he knew the air in the Base was getting staler as the crisis progressed, but he couldn't afford to worry about that now.
More urgent was the need to find out why Piper had felt it necessary to shut down the neural net like this.
Only then could he decide if it was safe to reboot the system.
His foot touched a black rubberized cylinder, and he stopped his headlong dash instantly.
He bent to examine the device.
A torch.
Piper's?
Pocketing it, he moved on.
Behind him, unnoticed, faint beams of light shimmered  softly, and without apparent source, across the corridor walls.
‘Atten- shun .’
Six pairs of polycarbide-armoured boots slapped the IMC executive transporter bay deckplates at the Staff Sergeant's command.
Six high-power weapons chunked as they were slung across six heavily muscled male and female shoulders.
Silence hung in the air.
‘Squad Number One: prepare for executive transporter embarkation.
You know the drill, now let's move!
Point!’
Sharon Kreig and Jay Ardamal double-timed it up the footramp and into the waiting executive transporter.
By twos the rest of their squad followed, stowing their gear as the Staff Sergeant followed them in.
A coiling black ribbon writhed into being and floated in mid-air next to the Sergeant's head.
‘You have the paperwork?’
‘Affirmative, Legion.’
‘Good.’
The black ribbon gathered itself into a knot, turned inside out and was gone.
The osmotic field opened and the executive transporter lifted gracefully into space.
Craig Richards finished his torchlit check of the power control systems and slammed the access hatch shut with an angry growl.
Ergs were there aplenty: they just weren't being channelled anywhere.
That meant the control circuits were down, and that meant a whole new set of checks was going to have to be made.
What really cheesed him off, though, was the fact that the food reconstituters were down as well.
He could really have done with a steaming hot beaker of
He paused, his thought uncompleted.
From deeper within the Power Bay came a sound.
He frowned.
The sub-standard systems Earth Central had seen fit to install in the Base made some weird noises at the best of times, but this….
This was unlike anything he'd ever heard  before.
Craig scratched his head.
‘Hello?
Anushkia?
Who's there?
Zehavi, are you sleepwalking again?
Come on, stop playing silly buggers, you're putting the wind right up me.’
The sound came nearer, resolving into a kind of low whispering.
Flickering beams of dim light came with it, caressing the machinery which shielded their source from direct view.
The light moved like smoke, or heavy gas not in straight lines, but floating ribbons….
Or tentacles.
Craig reached into his pocket and caressed his lucky deck of cards, then felt around with his other hand and picked up a flat toolcase made of heavy-duty plastic.
It wasn't much of a weapon but
‘Craig!
Craig Richards!
Are you in here?’
The voice came from outside.
Slipping the toolcase into his overalls, Craig backed away from the strange phenomenon.
‘Damn right I am.
And I'm coming out now.’
Without taking his eyes off the stacks of machinery which shielded the glimmer from direct sight, Craig walked quickly backwards until he felt the entrance hatch to the Power Bay thump into his shoulder.
He jumped as a voice beside him said, ‘Leave this lot, will you?
The Doctor wants everyone back in Operations, pronto.’
Craig turned to face Bernice and Teal.
‘I can handle that,’ he whispered fervently as he pushed past them and rushed off up the corridor.
Bernice glanced at Teal.
‘What do you suppose is biting his arse?’
The engineer shrugged.
‘Your guess is as good as mine.’
He gazed into the Power Bay.
Apart from the light from Craig's torch, still propped where he had left it against the main power conduits, the chamber was dark and empty.
Christine stared in fascination at the being that had appeared in the medlab before her.
‘You have the paperwork?’
‘Paperwork?’
‘My name is Legion.’
‘What paperwork?
Who — what — are you?’
There was a pause.
‘I am the captain of Interstellar Mining Corporation vessel Insider Trading .’
‘IMC!’
‘Good.’
There was another pause.
The black construct before her split, spun into a thin loop, fleshed into a globe, flipped inside out to reveal a hovering pink mass, which detached itself from the main bulk and drifted some distance away.
The black elements passed through one another and recombined.
Christine stood.
She said firmly, ‘Well, thank you, Captain, for being so informative.
May I have my clothes back now?’
‘Of course.
I would not want to return you to your female progenitor in what, from my briefings on human culture, I perceive to be an indecorous condition.’
Christine's face hardened.
‘My mother!’
‘Is responsible for IMC's presence here.
Yes.’
It wasn't Piper O'Rourke but Tiw Heimdall that Bishop found on his excursion through the Base.
The little man was standing in the middle of the Bridge terminus, head cocked to one side as if he could hear something, fists clenched at his sides.
Bishop stopped a few steps into the chamber.
Tiw didn't move.
‘Trau Heimdall.’
Tiw's head turned slowly.
He smiled thinly at Bishop.
Something glittered with a golden sheen between his lips.
‘Something comes, Adjudicator.
My teeth — they tingle.’
Despite himself, Bishop shivered when he heard the flat intonation of Tiw Heimdall's voice.
He moved carefully into the chamber, glancing around at the curved walls, and the curtains of rock beyond.
He drew his gun, letting it guide his eyes around the rest of the chamber.
‘I can smell it.’
‘What, Trau Heimdall?’
‘Something….
Something….’
Satisfied the chamber was empty apart from himself and Tiw, Bishop holstered his gun.
‘Trau Heimdall, we must leave here immed….’
His voice died away.
‘Who said that?’
‘I said nothing.’
Bishop drew his gun.
‘Can you hear anything?’
‘Smell something, I can.
Like grass growing in the meadows, like thunderclouds gathering in the sky in the days before the weather control —’
‘Come on.
We're leaving.’
‘I think I will stay.’
‘No!’
Bishop turned to face Tiw Heimdall.
There was a dim light behind him, writhing slowly in the air.
Bishop levelled his gun, but Tiw prevented him from getting a clear view of the target.
‘Trau Heimdall.
Move aside!’
Tiw slowly turned to face the phenomenon.
‘Be not scared.’
‘Move aside!’
‘I will not.’
Scowling, Bishop leapt forward and grabbed Tiw around the waist with one hand.
Without holstering his gun, or taking his eyes off the glimmering phenomenon, Bishop dragged the little man from the chamber and threw him bodily into the Pit.
The light grew closer.
Without even pausing to catch his breath, an ever more difficult prospect in the thinning atmosphere, Bishop dived in after him.
Christine stared down at the executive transporter bay from an observation gallery thirty metres above the floor.
Below her, technicians were preparing a long-range executive transporter for launch.
Across the far side of the bay, a shimmering window of electric blue in the wall looked like an upended lake.
‘What is that?’ she asked.
Beside her hovered Legion, in a multiplicity of bodies, all of which somehow gave the impression of looking directly at her.
‘An osmotic field,’ it replied, basso and treble in harmony.
‘It keeps the air in and the vacuum out.
I'm told that humans prefer it that way.’
‘And IMC market it?
I'm impressed.
Technology has moved on since we left Earth.’
‘IMC want to market it,’ Legion corrected.
‘My people lease the rights to IMC for a substantial sum.
One of the many dimensional technologies that IMC court us for.’
Christine's gaze travelled downwards to where the slabsided long-range executive transporter was being refitted and refuelled.
‘There's no way I'm going anywhere in that shuttle.
If my mother wants me off the Project, she can damn well go through channels and see how far it gets her.’
‘But, Krau LaFayette, your female progenitor has gone through channels.
With Earth in receivership, control of Project Eden transfers to the Earth Alliance of Corporations.
Being head of the Board of Directors, as well as a major stockholder in said company, your female progenitor has complete control over mission profile and personnel.’
‘I don't believe it.
We've been out here too long and risked too much for Earth Central to give up on us now.’
‘Earth Central no longer exists.
My brief is to reorganize the Project along more efficient and profitable lines.
Prompt action is required to salvage what might otherwise turn into a most embarrassing financial debacle.’
‘Action?
What action?
And what about the people?’
There was a momentary pause.
‘In light of the current financial situation, all employment contracts have been terminated.’
‘What about the Project?
You can't ship us all home now!’
‘You are correct.
Sufficient funding for transport of non-essential personnel does not exist.’
Christine gaped.
‘What do you —’
‘Please excuse me.
There are things I must attend to.’
A uniformed officer walked along the gallery towards them.
His face was pocked with scars from one of the many auto-immune diseases that were still rife on Earth.
‘Staff Officer Atrimonides will make sure every comfort is provided for your journey home.’
Legion wrapped itself into five separate knots and shrank to nothing.
Piper O'Rourke sank to the floor, her chest heaving, unable to draw breath.
The air.
The air was going.
That was it, then.
It had all been for nothing; the fear, the guilt, the deaths….
All for nothing.
She slipped sideways and felt a familiar coaming beneath her hand.
The airlock!
She had come full circle.
Dragging herself to her feet, Piper stumbled across the threshold of the chamber.
All she had to do now was
‘Piper O'Rourke.
I know you're in there.’
The Doctor.
‘You can stop running now.
I'm nine hundred and forty-three, and that's far too old to be chasing around like a S'ss'arian gyeet.’
‘What!’
Despite herself, Piper yelped with surprise.
‘You're never-’ She stopped, abruptly aware that the Doctor was trying to gain her confidence.
The Doctor's face appeared from the darkness, smiling.
‘Do you mind if I sit down?
Ahh.
That's better.’
He shook his head.
‘Why did you do it, Piper?’
Piper fought to get her breathing under control.
She looked into the Doctor's eyes, noticing that they glowed faintly, as if gathering and enhancing the available light.
‘Why should I tell you anything?
Bishop's going to kill me anyway.’
‘I'm not here to judge you, Piper.
But can you tell me a reason why everyone else on the Base must die to protect your secret?’
‘No.
Nobody should have died.
Nobody!’
She took a deep breath and began to speak.
Christine watched as flight technicians finished preparing the executive transporter for launch.
Atrimonides gestured with his gun, indicating that she should precede him from the gallery.
‘What if I don't want to go?’
‘As it happens, Ma'am, you do have a choice.
You can either walk, or we can freeze you where you stand and ship you back in a refrigerator.’
‘Charming.’
‘Efficient.’
Christine glared at the man.
She opened the pressure door and moved into the executive transporter bay control room, a semicircular chamber filled with operations and monitoring equipment.
Christine looked around.
IMC employees — risk analysts and financial assessors like clones in their sharp plastic business suits and laced necklines — moved busily from one station to another, checking systems as the time for launch approached.
One balanced a beaker of steaming coffee on a nearby terminal before moving on bearing a full tray.
Christine acted without thinking.
Scooping the cup from the workstation with her good hand, she whirled around and flung its contents into Atrimonides' face.
He screamed and clawed at his eyes.
Christine made a grab for his gun as it spun away, but only succeeded in pushing it into a console, where its trigger caught on the comer.
A searing beam of high-energy protons blistered the air.
Something on the other side of the room exploded, and kept on exploding.
Christine didn't wait to see what damage she'd caused.
She headed for the door at a dead run, her new arm thumping uselessly against various items of furniture.
Teal saw torch beams bobbing towards him from a side corridor and grabbed Bernice's arm.
Seconds later, Bishop and Tiw Heimdall came into view.
‘Picks me up!
Like a piece of luggage, he picks me up and throws me, he does,throws me down the Pit!’
Teal  and Bernice exchanged grins.
‘Teal, you tell him.
I'm important, me.
I should not be thrown around like luggage!’
‘Okay, Bishop.
What have you been doing with Tiw?’
The Adjudicator did not smile.
‘I saw it again.
We both did.
The light.
He wanted to stay.’
Teal's smile faded.
‘Are you sure?’
Bishop crossed his arms.
‘As an Adjudicator, I am a trained, completely impartial, observer.’
‘Yes, and I'm a Martian Queen,’ Bernice snorted.
‘We'd better get back to the Operations Room.’
Spinning on her heel, she led the way back along the corridor.
Christine ran.
Somewhere behind her, Atrimonides was screaming in pain above a babble of voices.
‘— this mess cleared —’
’— wait a minute, can you smell —’
’— Earth Mother preserve us!
We've got a fire —’
’— an extinguisher!
Somebody get —’
’— no good, I can't hold them —’
’— what?
How many systems?
Bloody —’
Christine slapped her palm against the lockplate of the door.
Behind her, Atrimonides lurched clear of a rising pall of smoke.
She dashed clear of the control room and on to the second half of the observation gallery, thirty metres above the main executive transporter bay.
Sirens blared across the chamber.
Technicians dropped their tools and ran for the interior of the ship.
The control room door slammed shut behind Atrimonides as he ran on to the gallery and hurled himself at Christine.
His face was blistered from the hot coffee and one eye was closed.
The other glared malevolently.
Christine turned to run, but there was a muffled thud in the control room.
The observation windows blew out in a shower of glass.
The shock rocked the gallery and sent her sprawling back into Atrimonides.
There was another concussion.
Atrimonides snarled.
Christine fought for her balance as he grasped her with  hooked fingers.
The guard rail twisted beneath her hands, and they fell backwards into empty space.
Cheryl moved towards the airlock.
She stood at the door, the Doctor's name poised on her lips, but just before she called out, something made her hesitate.
There were soft voices coming from inside.
The Doctor…and Piper!
She crept closer, straining to hear what was being said.
’— and the Project had been going for so long, you see.
So long, with no results.
The situation on Earth was desperate, we all knew that.
We had to succeed.’
The Doctor's voice said, ‘And so you infected the starsuits with a software virus.’
‘That's right.’
Was that a note of desperation in Piper's voice?
‘Earth needed results and we couldn't get them.
IMC could, but there was no legal way to transfer information — so they gave me a virus and I implanted it into the starsuits.
The virus travelled into the neural net during a regular systems update and began to transmit information to IMC.
To facilitate their takeover.’
The Doctor sighed.
‘But the virus was cheap.
Cheap and nasty, like everything about IMC.
It caused system malfunctions.
Suit malfunctions.’
Cheryl felt a cold fist clench around her heart.
‘Like the one that killed Paula.’
‘Yes.
But I-’
‘You bitch!
It was you all the time.
You killed her!’
Cheryl ran into the airlock chamber and grabbed Piper by the throat, jerking the woman harshly to her feet.
The Doctor stood as well.
‘Cheryl, please, I hardly think this is the right moment for-’
‘Shut up!’
Her eyes narrowed and she drew back her fist.
‘I'm going to kill her!’
She slammed her clenched fist into Piper's face.
Time seemed to slow down as Christine fell into the executive transporter bay.
She could see a row of tiny faces gaping from the balcony before being engulfed by a huge sheet of flame.
The smell of Atrimonides' burning  face and hair was thick in her nostrils.
She gagged.
And then the floor of the bay was rushing up towards them.
Atrimonides was grabbing wildly at her, desperately flailing his hands and feet, and Cheryl realized he was trying to use her as a reaction mass to slow his own fall.
Unaware that she was screaming, Christine reached towards his face with her one good arm and hooked her fingers into the burns which crusted his cheek.
He screamed and jerked.
Christine whirled out of control.
There was another explosion.
Christine felt her stomach lurch as the executive transporter bay gravity generator fluctuated, flinging her and Atrimonides into a spiralling loop, then failed completely, leaving her weightless.
Foam began to spread through the air as the fire-fighting systems reacted automatically to the emergency.
Half blinded by the foam, Christine scrambled for something to grab on to to break her fall.
Bernice, Bishop and Tiw Heimdall entered the Operations Room.
Julie Ndobe, Shmuel Zehavi and Teal Green were talking in low voices.
Craig Richards was standing alone, some distance away.
Anushkia Smyslov had bandaged Alex Bannen's head, and the physicist was propped in a sitting position against a workstation.
He looked up eagerly as Bernice walked over to him.
‘How are you feeling?’
‘Well enough to reboot this pile of rust.’
Anushkia said, ‘I've told you, Alex.
Not until the Doctor says.
We still don't know why Piper crashed the system.
Until we do, it would be foolhardy to even consider —’
She stopped.
‘Did anyone hear-’
There was an explosion of light.
Someone was yelling, but Christine couldn't make out the words.
The executive transporter bay was a chaos of foam and whirling shapes which might or might not have been armed troopers.
A fist lashed out at her from the  whiteness.
Christine gasped.
Her lungs burned as she inhaled foam; she vomited.
Small-arms fire scorched a web of gaps through the foam.
‘Who's the idiot still firing?
Huang?
If that executive transporter goes up, I'll personally eat your kidneys, capishe  ?
Now get her!’
Atrimonides.
Something huge and black loomed out of the mist of foam.
Christine slammed shoulders first into one of the slab-like metal sides of a long-range executive transporter.
She gasped.
Her head banged against the surface.
Momentum carried her down the hull into the deadspace between the executive transporter and the bay wall.
She shook her head to clear it.
The foam was not so dense down here, and the recyclers were beginning to suck away what little there was.
‘Get her!’
Atrimonides swung into sight followed by a group of troopers.
Strings of bloody vomit drooled from his mouth, a legacy of prolonged foam inhalation.
But as the gauntleted hands of the first trooper made a grab for her hair, Christine felt an empty sensation in the pit of her stomach.
The executive transporter seemed to be pressing against her back.
It was moving!
Face twisted with rage, Cheryl drew back her fist and threw another punch.
Blood burst from Piper's nose.
She fell back against one of the emergency spacesuit lockers, and the unpowered door flipped open at the touch of her body.
Cheryl stepped forward to deliver another blow — just in time to catch the dead body of her husband as it fell from the locker.
The slab side of the executive transporter loomed like a cliff out of the white fog, getting larger by the second as the shock wave from the explosions which had set it adrift  in the first place propelled it nearer and nearer the executive transporter bay wall.
The troopers were scattering away from Christine, thrashing through the foam, well aware that although the executive transporter had no weight, it still had mass, and hence momentum.
A lot of momentum.
Enough to squash Christine, and anyone else in the vicinity, against the wall like bugs.
She glanced quickly from side to side.
There was a lot of transporter, and she was half way along it: too far in either direction to make it to safety.
She glanced up; no chance there, either: a loading gantry projected from the wall above her head.
It was already buckling as the executive transporter moved remorselessly nearer.
She scanned its side, looking for something — anything — that might help her survive the impact.
All she could see before a whirling storm of foam obscured everything were attitude control thrusters, IMC logos and refuelling ports.
Cheryl clutched hopelessly at Sam Russell's body and burst into tears.
She nestled his mottled face in the curve of her shoulder, stroked his cold hair, felt the awful grating of the bones in his neck.
Her eyes were cold when she lifted them to Piper's face.
‘The suit malfunctioned!’
Piper cried.
‘I didn't know!
I found him here on the floor with his neck broken.
I didn't kill him!’
Cheryl let Sam's body slump gracelessly to the floor and moved towards Piper, hands outstretched.
The executive transporter was six metres away.
One group of troopers had tangled together in their panic, still in the executive transporter's path.
Fights were breaking out as the knot of flailing bodies rotated gently in mid-air.
Five metres.
Christine could now make out charred patches of hull and the seams where metal plates had been hyperglued together.
Four metres.
Klaxons hooted.
Sparks from the balcony drifted through the foam, becoming soggy bits of black carbon which mixed with it, looking like dirty snow.
Voices screamed.
Three metres.
Two indistinct figures had broken away from the struggling mass and were desperately flailing towards Christine and the safe area at the other end of the executive transporter.
‘ACCESS HATCH’, she read embossed into a transparent panel, and, in smaller letters underneath, ‘IN EMERGENCY, ENTER CODE 398.’
A small keypad sat smugly beneath the panel.
Two metres.
One.
The troopers were screaming.
She flipped the panel up and keyed in the code, banging her elbow against the wall as the executive transporter pressed close.
The word ‘ERROR’ scrolled up in glowing virtual letters on the metal panel beside the keypad.
Bernice's torch flickered and died.
People scrambled away from the centre of the Operations Room in panic.
A nimbus of light had collected there, spinning gently.
A low whispering sound echoed around the room.
‘What the hell —’ she said.
Thin air gathered itself around the light, thickening.
A shape was forming there, something….
Something….
Someone screamed.
Bernice felt something, some force, move through her, penetrating her skin as though it were ether.
A yell of surprise was wrenched out of her.
The sensation passed, leaving her nauseous and curiously empty….
In the centre of the room, the light gathered into a curling ribbon and solidified, erupted into a rippling curtain of sparkles.
‘Is that….
Paula ?’ someone said.
There was a smell, like summer, like —
A final flash of light and the phenomenon was gone.
In its place stood Miles Engado.
Christine had to bend her arm down by her side to get her fingers to connect with the keys.
Because of her awkward position, she was forced to use the prosthetic arm (the fake one, she kept thinking), and the fingers were dull and leaden.
The sudden pressure of cold metal against her nose forced her to turn her head sideways until she couldn't see the keys any more.
She prayed, and fumbled the code in.
A hand clutched at her shoulder, then moved to circle her neck with killing force.
A burned face loomed out of the greyness.
Atrimonides.
Sweat stood out on his brow, fury was bright in his one good eye.
The fingers tightened their grip.
Unable to bring her hands up to defend herself, Christine began to choke.
‘Christ.
Sam.
Sam!
Oh, Christ.
Piper, you bitch.’
Cheryl threw another punch.
She laughed hysterically as Piper grunted with pain and fell to the deck.
Cheryl knelt beside the sobbing woman, drew back her fist and prepared to follow up her blow with another.
The Doctor casually took her wrist in his hand and held her motionless, without the slightest effort.
‘That'll be quite enough of that, thank you very much.’
‘You don't understand.
She killed Paula.
I loved her and I loved Sam and that bitch killed them both!’
Piper was cowering abjectly against the far wall, her face streaming with tears.
The Doctor turned furiously to Cheryl, and was about to speak when there was a grating clunk from the outer airlock door.
He paused, his words unspoken.
Cheryl wiped tears of her own from her face.
All three looked at the door.
There was a moment's silence.
With a tremendous crash, the centre of the door exploded inwards.
Seven figures in military uniforms strode through the clouds of smoke and across the rubble into the chamber.
A short figure in a sergeant's uniform and full battle helmet stepped forward, gun raised.
The figure kicked aside Sam Russell's dead body without a second glance, like so much extra trash.
‘Project Eden is now in receivership.
All employment contracts are terminated.
I have a warrant granting all property and chattels, in full, in situ , to IMC.’
The Doctor's eyes widened at the sound of the voice, and at the face revealed as the sergeant raised her helmet.
‘Full cooperation is advised,’ Ace said tersely, and fired a blast from her weapon into the wall beside the Doctor's head to illustrate her point.
With Atrimonides' fingers biting painfully into her neck, the hatch slid away to reveal blackness.
The executive transporter moved past Christine on all sides.
With a desperate cry she fell forward, into the carpeted interior of the executive transporter's emergency airlock.
The grasping hand at her neck convulsed once, agonizingly, and then relaxed.
The executive transporter boomed like a giant bell as it impacted against the bay wall.
Christine didn't hear the scream.
No longer attached to his body, Atrimonides' hand drifted free of the hatch coaming.
Something red and pulpy squeezed out of the centimetre-wide gap between the executive transporter and the bay wall, forming shivering globules which clung to the wall's hexagonal bracing struts.
As the emergency airlock hatch slid shut, Christine curled up into a floating ball and was violently sick.
DEMOGORGON
Corporations have neither bodies to be punished nor souls to be condemned, they therefore do as they like.
Edward, First Baron Thurlow
As Bernice entered the refectory she almost bumped into the Doctor.
He was standing just inside the doorway, supporting Piper O'Rourke, who was looking old, tired and bruised.
Beside them both, Cheryl Russell was sucking her bloodied knuckles.
Over the Time Lord's shoulder, Bernice saw that the refectory was full.
The entire Project Eden team — or what was left of it — was milling around: cowed, shocked and submissive.
IMC troopers stood along the periphery of the room with raised weapons.
The simularity in the centre of the refectory was even displaying the company logo: the letters IMC in brushed duralinium, curved around a spiral galaxy.
It looked to Bernice like a hand crushing a butterfly.
‘Move it!’
A muscular Company goon in macho combat gear slapped her rump.
She turned and was about to deck him when she realized that his needler was aimed at her stomach.
‘I said move it!’
He grinned.
His teeth were even and white, and Bernice wanted to ram them down his throat.
His chest tag read ‘ARDAMAL’.
Bernice stared him down: memorizing his face and making sure that he knew it.
His smile grew wider.
She stalked off before she said something that he might regret, stepping accidentally on one of the deactivated security drones now littering the Base, and cracking its delicate shell.
Clang.
The massive airtight door to the refectory swung shut.
Silence fell.
People glanced fearfully around at the impassive troops, waiting for the executions to start.
The baleful light from the windows cast trembling shadows  towards the IMC logo.
Somewhere in the background, the food dispenser drifted aimlessly, offering tasty delicacies to uninterested people.
Bernice beckoned the Doctor over.
‘What do you think they're going to do with us?’ she hissed.
‘If they wanted to kill us, they'd have done it already.’
‘Oh yes?’
‘Look at it from their point of view.
Why waste the energy?’
‘We have to do something,’ she urged.
‘I'm open to suggestions.’
‘I thought you were supposed to be the one who always had all the answers.’
He smiled bashfully.
‘A convincing bluff, I'm afraid.’
‘Certainly took me in.’
Bernice glanced around.
‘Oh hell,’ she continued, ‘I'm going to make a break for it.
Can you cause some kind of distraction, Doctor?’
‘Distraction is my middle name.’
‘Yes, one of them,’ Bernice muttered as the Doctor bounded into the centre of the room.
‘Well,’ he announced, ‘no doubt you're all wondering why I called you here.’
All heads turned to watch him as he reached into his pocket and took out three multicoloured balls.
‘You'll like this.’
He began to juggle, making it look as if he was just on the verge of dropping the balls each time he caught them.
‘There is nothing up my sleeves but my arms, there is nothing down my trousers but a ferret.’
People started laughing: nervously at first, and then with real amusement.
A wave of relaxation swept across the room.
Even the troopers seemed to be fascinated as they crowded closer for a better look.
Perhaps their orders didn't cover lunatic Time Lord jugglers.
Bernice took advantage of the show to slide sideways, until she was standing behind Miles, Teal Green and a psychologist named Filo Julee.
A few yards away, the food dispenser's sensor light was on as it scanned the crowd for likely clients.
She looked it over.
It was just about large enough….
‘Hey,’ she whispered.
The food dispenser ignored her.
‘Hey, over here!
Don't you recognize a customer when you see one?’
The machine wafted away from her and attempted to interest a pale Miles Engado in a tofu bar.
The Doctor had four balls in the air now, although nobody could see where the extra one had come from.
He was milking the audience for all he could get: throwing the balls out in every direction and catching them in a windmill of arms.
He was mugging terribly, his rubber features running the gamut of exaggerated emotions from wide-eyed amazement to crumpled despair.
‘Oh, for….’
She tried to catch up with the machine, but she didn't want to attract any undue attention from the IMC troopers, and the thing seemed determined to ignore her.
Christ, she thought savagely, a person could starve to death whilst that thing forces sticky buns on dieters and ham rolls on vegetarians!
Finally, she grabbed hold of the dispenser's cooling fin whilst it was waving a krill doughnut around in a vain attempt to attract custom, pulled it close and, in a casual and unremarkable manner, moved her hand down to the dispenser's access plate and ran her fingers around the seam until she felt a magnetic bolt buzzing beneath her fingers.
The Doctor was standing on one hand now, and juggling five different balls whilst singing a medley of songs by Abba.
Under cover of the racket he was making, and the laughter of his audience, Bernice quickly removed the first four bolts.
The fifth one decided, for some mysterious mechanical reason that only small but vital components are privy to, that it was going to play up.
Bent over at an ungainly angle, trying to wrench the thing free, Bernice was acutely conscious of the picture that she must be making.
The small of her back began to feel warm as she imagined a small bead of laser light centred there, cueing a flamer, or a needler, or a screamer, or anything nasty and permanent.
There!
The bolt came away with a tacky wrenching sensation.
Somebody had probably spilled something on it.
Bernice straightened from her crouch with the five bolts buzzing like bees in her hand, pulled the access plate open and furtively tried to check the space inside the dispenser.
Most of the food seemed already to have been disseminated, and a safety cut-out had switched off the stasis field when she opened the hatch.
Bernice dumped the remaining food on the floor with a few sweeps of her hand and kicked it under the rubber skirts of the machine.
She glanced around with an innocent expression on her face, but all eyes were on the Doctor's antics.
She pulled the shelves out and climbed swiftly inside the food dispenser, jerking the leads from the stasis-field generator and pulling the plate shut after her.
There was something sticky beneath her fingers.
Chocolate?
Machine oil?
Whatever it was, it was just the icing on a whole mountain of complaints.
She was forced to crouch in the bowels of the machine with her knees up around her ears, her elbows jammed against the interior dispensing machinery and her back wedged so tightly against the shelf supports that she was going to come out with her spine looking like a piece of corrugated duralinium.
And the machine did have bowels — she could smell them: a dark, rancid odour comprising the spilled residue of a hundred types of food.
She wanted to be sick, but that would be a bad idea.
A very bad idea.
Paper-thin knives of light penetrated through air vents in the dispenser's casing and drew hot lines across Bernice's face.
Motes of dust sparkled and died as they drifted in and out of the beams.
Bernice wanted to sneeze.
By screwing her eyes up against the glare, she could just about make out what was going on in the refectory.
The Doctor was standing on his head and juggling the balls by knocking them with the soles of his feet whilst gargling ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’.
One of the troopers was passing his helmet around his colleagues, who were putting money into it.
A collection?
Bernice didn't know where the Doctor got his talent from, but if he ever got  tired of fighting ultimate evil, he could make a healthy profit as an intergalactic busker.
Suddenly the balls were gone.
The Doctor stood frozen with his legs waving wildly and a baffled expression on his face.
The laughter swelled, and was supplemented by applause, which died away slowly as the crowd gradually realized that this was not part of the act.
The Doctor clambered petulantly to his feet, with the thunderous expression of a child whose toys have been impounded.
Bernice watched, amazed, as a spiral of pink flesh rotated in the air behind the Doctor.
Six more joined it, slowly screwing out of nothing, until they suddenly stretched together into a tangled web of pulsating tendrils.
Four of the Doctor's five balls appeared in the midst of the fleshy curtain.
Silence.
‘Allow me to introduce myself,’ said a multitude of voices.
‘My name is Legion, and I am your new Managing Director.
Earth Central has ceased to exist.
The Earth Alliance of Corporations now rules your planet.’
‘Didn't your mother ever tell you it was polite to knock?’ the Doctor exclaimed, turning.
‘Assuming you had a mother, of course.’
He reached up, plucked his balls from Legion's body and stashed them inside his capacious pockets.
He frowned, and looked around.
‘One missing.
Ah!’
He stood on the tips of his toes and stretched a hand above his head.
Bernice squinted through the air vents, trying to get a better look.
Hang on a tick, she thought.
That can't be right.
The Doctor's hand appeared to have vanished from the wrist up.
His arm waggled, as if he were groping for something, and then his hand appeared as softly and suddenly as it had vanished: holding the fifth ball.
‘You have knowledge of higher dimensions, I see,’ Legion boomed.
‘A smattering,’ the Doctor said, carefully dusting off his ball.
‘Trau Bishop?’
‘Doctor?’
Bishop detached himself from the watching crowd.
‘Arrest this being.’
‘On what grounds?’
‘Sabotage and murder.’
‘You can prove these allegations?’
Bishop asked levelly.
‘Of course.’
‘Forgive me,’ Legion interrupted, sincerity oozing from each of its voices, ‘but I have only just arrived in this solar system.
I was light years away at the time these alleged crimes took place.
IMC records will prove it.’
‘But the responsibility is yours,’ the Doctor trumpeted.
‘You gave the orders.
You provided the virus which caused the software to crash in Paula Engado's starsuit, resulting in her death in the atmosphere of Lucifer.
That same software caused a rogue malfunction in another starsuit, killing Sam Russell.
Your agent on Belial also murdered Federique Moshe-Rabaan in an attempt to divert Adjudicator Bishop's suspicions: an attempt which would have succeeded had it not been for my,’ and he preened himself, ‘abilities at detection.
That same agent blew up the room I had been in because I was getting too close.
Fortunately, Trau Bishop and I had set that room up as a trap, knowing that your agent wouldn't be able to resist the bait.
But they pulled the plug on the Belial neural net before we could use the security drones to trace their actions, risking the lives of everybody.
Another crime to add to the register.
And it was, of course, your troops who invaded Moloch Base, killing all the people who were there.
Apart from one….’
‘This is pure fabrication,’ Legion protested as the Doctor looked across at one of the troopers, the one in the mirrored visor who had followed him in.
The trooper stepped forward, raising the visor to reveal Ace's face.
The food dispenser seemed to sway around Bernice's body.
Pins and needles tingled in her fingers and toes, creeping along her limbs until she felt as if she were disconnected from the world.
Ace!
She was alive!
And with IMC?
Something in the back of her mind was saying: shock,, you're in shock, Bernice snap out of it, woman, but she tuned it out and just stared at Ace until the world  came back into focus around her and she heard Bishop saying calmly:
‘So, this is the agent IMC planted on Belial.’
‘No,’ the Doctor sighed.
‘Ace is just confused.
Legion's agent is someone else.’
‘Who?’
Bishop asked calmly.
‘I….
I can't say.’
The Doctor's gaze momentarily flickered across the room, but too fast for Bernice to tell who he was looking at.
‘Really?
You surprise me.
Or rather, you don't.
A transparent attempt to protect your former friend.’
‘Permission to speak, Legion,’ Ace said.
‘Permission granted, Staff Sergeant.’
‘The Doctor is lying.’
A murmur ran around the unwilling audience.
‘How so?’
Bishop asked.
‘All of the people from Moloch are still alive.’
‘You have seen them?’
‘Yes.
Well, no…. but I've seen their med pallets.
There was some shooting — some people were injured but the people from Moloch, they're okay, I think….’
To Bernice, Ace seemed to be losing the thread, getting confused but, never the less, she could see the relief in people's faces.
They hadn't wanted to believe that Kosi, Lars, Rachel and the rest were dead.
It was far easier to think that a terrible mistake had been made.
‘It's not true,’ the Doctor protested.
‘We found the bodies.’
‘The bodies were of IMC troops,’ Legion said; softly, loudly, and in tones ranging from baritone to treble.
‘I sent them in to retrieve Christine LaFayette, the female offspring of the woman who now…manages…your Earth.
As Staff Sergeant Ace said, the people on Moloch became violent.
The only deaths were of IMC staff.’
Bernice almost wished she was out there in the refectory so that she could confront Legion.
The alien was lying.
Genetic tests had matched up the body parts on Moloch with everyone who had been there, apart from Ace and Christine.
Damn Miles for wanting the information  suppressed until the crisis was over and the shock could be minimized.
Now, whatever they said, it was too late.
Good news was always more palatable than bad.
Teal, Craig, Tiw — they wanted to believe.
Faith was a powerful drug.
The Doctor knew it too.
Bernice could tell as she glanced over at him.
He seemed to have shrunk inside his clothes.
Legion had outmanoeuvred him.
Getting Ace on his side had helped: the Doctor had an attachment to the woman that went deeper than either of them would admit.
It made Bernice jealous, but she would never let that dictate her behaviour.
Ace had a prior claim on the Doctor's affections.
No matter what he and Bernice had been through, she knew in her heart of hearts that his guilt over what he had done to Ace on Heaven — and before — was a weakness: a button which would always work to throw him off balance when pressed.
Everybody's attention was on the centre of the room, where the IMC logo had been replaced with a densely written virtual document.
‘Study it closely,’ Legion was saying.
‘You will find your terms of redundancy are fair.
You will each receive one month's salary and a reasonable amortization of your pension contributions.
As of this moment, Project Eden is no more.’
Tiw Heimdall stepped forward, his golden teeth glittering.
Before he could say anything, Legion answered his question in a prim falsetto.
‘IMC cannot be held responsible for the fact that your Earth Central contracts failed to guarantee your return journeys.’
‘And what about the return to Earth?’
Tiw asked, trailing off into a mumble as he realized that Legion had anticipated him.
‘However,’ Legion rumbled on, ‘despite the fact that IMC is a mining company, not a people-mover, we may be able to provide some berths.’
‘For a price,’ the Doctor said, scowling.
‘For a reasonable price,’ Legion agreed.
‘Now for the documentation.
Where is Coordinator Engado?’
‘Here….’
Miles staggered forward, with the support of Teal Green and Craig Richards.
He waved them off, and pulled himself upright to face Legion.
His knees looked to Bernice as if they were on the verge of buckling.
‘I believe you'll find everything in order,’ Legion said.
For a moment, the voice echoed inside the dispenser casing, as if somebody were leaning close behind Bernice and whispering in her ear.
She jumped, thinking she had been discovered.
The feeling only lasted a second, but from the way Tanetoa, Belial's Samoan cook, flinched, some thirty feet away, Bernice guessed that Legion's voice was doing a little travelling.
Not that his body was terribly stable.
The pink lacy curtain had been slowly turning green and rolling up into a thin worm, studded with tiny thorns, that hung in mid-air.
Little silver spheres at either end seemed to scan the crowd hungrily.
Miles's eyes were dull.
His body sagged.
A computer crystal had appeared in his hand, and he looked at it in mild bemusement, as if it were a fish, or a coloured party hat.
‘Please scan the document and affix your personal ident code,’ Legion was saying brusquely, his voice faint.
Across the far side of the room, Shmuel Zehavi jumped as if goosed.
Something large and black stepped in front of the air vents.
All Bernice could see was a large utility belt with a screamer pistol in a holster and a row of charge packs.
A huge hand loomed in her field of vision.
Was that the sound of keys being tapped?
Shit!
Some IMC trooper obviously couldn't wait for lunch.
Bernice looked around desperately.
She didn't even know what they had ordered.
She scrabbled around on the floor of the dispenser, frantically trying to find something edible, anything that she had overlooked when she had cleared a space for herself; but it was useless.
‘Come on.
Come on….’ the trooper growled.
A robotic dispenser arm was whirring nervously and  jabbing into Bernice's neck as it tried to locate an item that wasn't there from a shelf that had been removed.
Bernice took a few moments break from her search to reach up and snap it off.
It flexed once or twice in her hand, then died.
She went back to her frantic exploration of the machine's interior.
There!
In the corner.
Some kind of cylindrical container.
Bernice grabbed it and shoved it through the dispensing slot.
‘What the zark!
I didn't order this,’ the trooper grumbled, shoving the container back into the slot.
It split, drenching Bernice with some sticky fruit drink.
With a sinking sensation in her stomach, she heard the trooper's fingers pound the keys again.
She fumbled around her feet again, but there was nothing but crumbs and scraps of wrapper.
‘Oh shit,’ she said, surreptitiously pushing the access hatch open a crack and thrusting her fingers through, hoping nobody would notice.
‘What's wrong with this thing?’ the trooper snarled.
Trickles of sweat dripped from her hair and down her temples, leaving an itchy heat behind them.
Her coveralls were damp, and stuck to her body as she writhed, trying to find something — anything — outside the machine.
Her fingers clutched vainly at empty air.
It was useless.
Her fingers suddenly brushed against a plastic wrapper.
Yes!
It was one of the items she had shoved beneath the machine's rubber skirt to make room.
She quickly pulled it in and shoved it through the slot, hoping it was the right thing.
Or even close.
‘What is the problem with this machine?’
Oh hell, Bernice sighed.
What was happening out there?
Was the trooper's behaviour attracting attention?
She twisted herself and tried to see through the buckled plate again.
Nobody in her line of sight was looking her way, but that didn't mean anything.
‘Hey, popcorn!’ the trooper in front of Bernice's food dispenser said, surprised.
‘I didn't know this thing had popcorn.’
The heavy utility belt vanished from Bernice's field of view, revealing the refectory again.
A wave of relief swept over her, making her nauseous and dizzy.
‘You can't go down to Lucifer,’ Miles said from somewhere in the refectory.
Bernice twisted to see him.
She hadn't been keeping track of the conversation, but he seemed to have pulled himself together over the past few minutes.
‘I'm sorry?’
Legion said.
‘You can't go down to Lucifer.’
Miles's voice was firmer.
‘Trau Engado, IMC can do anything it likes.’
‘No.
You don't understand.
You cannot go down.
You will be prevented.’
‘By whom?’
‘By my daughter,’ Miles announced.
A sound like an electric drill ran round the room.
It was Legion's laugh.
‘Your female offspring?
As I understand it, Trau Engado, she is dead.’
‘No,’ Miles said obstinately.
‘I've seen her.
I've talked with her.
She's alive.’
Bernice could see Legion's body splitting into a firework display of multi-coloured fronds, and slowly drawing together into a hairy black ovoid supported by three pipe-cleaner legs.
The hairs on the ovoid waved gently in a non-existent breeze.
‘I grow tired of the reasonable approach,’ Legion said.
‘The Earth Alliance of Corporations has bought out Earth Central.
There are no limits any more.
No rules.
No regulations.
Nothing about environmental impact, customer care, or good business practices.
IMC have been given a free….’
There was a pause.
Bernice heard Ace murmur something beneath her breath.
‘…hand,’ Legion continued, ‘to exploit all planets colonized, occupied or claimed by Earth for their mineral wealth.
This Project Eden of yours: five years and nothing to show for it.
I personally do not have time for delays  in this operation, and my approach has been ratified at the highest levels.
You, Coordinator Engado, are a hopeless incompetent.
I shall not be requiring your services any longer.
Is there somebody called Bannen here?’
Alex Bannen's footsteps echoed hesitantly through the refectory.
‘Yes, sir?’
‘I am informed that you will be amenable to cooperation.’
Bannen's voice positively glowed with anticipation.
‘Oh yes,’ he said.
‘Oh yes indeed!’
Outside, Adjudicator Bishop cleared his throat.
Events seemed to have overtaken him.
To Bernice, he sounded suspiciously like a man whose job had evaporated, leaving him high and dry.
‘I still have to find my murderer,’ he announced.
‘Well that's easy,’ Bannen said nastily.
‘Arrest Piper O'Rourke.’
There was a silence in the refectory.
‘That is an as-yet unproven accusation,’ Bishop said slowly, ‘albeit with some corroborative substance to it.
I shall require time to develop a case, to amass evidence —’
‘No time,’ Legion said brusquely.
‘IMC is the law here, and the law is death.’
‘Wait,’ Bishop and the Doctor chimed together.
Bernice watched as the Doctor took a step forward and opened his mouth.
Bishop grabbed his collar, hoisted him back and stepped in front of him.
‘I am still an Adjudicator of the Guild of Adjudicators,’ he announced, his voice ringing out around the refectory.
‘And I will have justice done this day!’
To emphasize his point, a massive gun suddenly appeared in his hand.
The troopers, reacting late, made Bishop the focus of their aim.
‘Wrong on three counts,’ said a gruff voice from the door.
Bernice threw her weight against the side of the food dispenser, trying to swivel it discreetly around.
The refectory door was open again, and standing in it, filling it, was the most grotesquely fat woman that Bernice had ever seen.
Her scalp gleamed as if freshly oiled, and  pornographic tattoos seemed to writhe across it with a life of their own.
Her robes were long and black; the points of her collar rose high above her head.
She stepped forward in a manner that was so delicate it was repulsive.
‘The Adjudicators are finished,’ she growled.
‘IMC has ruled the Guild to be an illegal organization.
And there is no justice.’
Bishop seemed to shrink within his robes.
‘Staff Sergeant Ace,’ Legion said.
Its voice seemed to hover over them all.
‘In accordance with IMC regulations, and at the behest of Trau Bannen, Coordinator Designate of Project Eden, take Krau O'Rourke away to somewhere private and have her made redundant.
With prejudice.’
For a long moment, nobody moved.
Finally Ace stepped forward.
She gestured at Piper with her flamer.
‘Come on,’ she snapped.
‘Let's go.’
Silence reigned after they had left.
Nobody but Bernice caught sight of the devastated expression on the Doctor's face.
‘You will all be segregated for the duration of the operation,’ Legion announced to the assembled Project Eden team.
‘To ensure a smooth transition of responsibility.’
Bernice had seen enough.
She tilted her body sideways.
The dispenser hummed as the null-grav units tried to compensate, and the machine juddered to one side.
Slowly, and with much complaining, the food dispenser wandered towards the door.
Piper slid from the Pit and into the transparent dome of the Belial Bridge terminal.
Moloch hung overhead like a small but angry demon.
Behind Moloch, the vast sphere of Lucifer cast a malignant crimson glare.
‘Move,’ Ace snapped behind her.
Piper stepped into the dome.
Ace moved to cover her.
‘Ace,’ Piper said, ‘I've talked to the Doctor.
He said —’
‘Shut up!’
‘What are you doing, Ace?
Don't you know what sort of a creature Legion is?’
‘Well, you should know.’
‘Well, there's nothing more to say, is there?’
Piper took a deep but shaky breath.
‘Are you going to get on with it, or what?’
‘Or what,’ Ace said, and fired.

Although Anne had made up her mind to forget her dreams about John Redmond, she still listened eagerly when Sarah talked about his efforts to find a job, now that his foot was completely healed.
‘Who were the friends he was with when I was at your house?’
Anne asked carefully, avoiding looking at her.
‘Were they from that club?’
‘No.
Just a crowd who talk hot air like himself,’ Sarah said scornfully.
‘You think he's daft, don't you?’
Anne said, laughing.
‘In some ways,’ Sarah conceded.
‘But I've got to admit he works for what he believes in.
Collecting for Spanish Food Relief in all weathers, and for the Goodfellow Fund.’
Anne felt a glow of pride at Sarah's words.
But only because he's a friend, she told herself hastily.
Sarah seemed equally pleased to hear good news about Joe.
Three replies had been received to the applications he had sent, and had been opened by his father as Joe had asked.
One said it was pointless to put him on a waiting list, but letters from a grain merchant's and from Littlewood's Pools promised to file his application and interview him when he returned home.
‘I feel almost guilty that so many good things are happening to us, when such a lot of people are having a bad time,’ Sarah said.
‘We're very lucky, aren't we, Anne?’
Anne often thought of Sarah's words during the following months.
They were lucky, she felt.
Everything seemed to be going right in both families.
Her father's order book was better filled than it had been for years, her mother's health seemed good, Eileen was happy in her work as a pools clerk, and Tony and Helen were happily planning their wedding.
All the family were enjoying life, and even Maureen seemed to have forgotten whatever it was that troubled her and to be quietly happy again.
Best of all, Joe was sure of being able to stay home after his trip.
Even if nothing came of the interviews, he could work for his father.
When Pat had told them of his new orders he said to his wife, ‘You'll have your lad home again, Julia, however it goes with, these letters he's had.
Now I can fix him up without him thinking he's taking the bread from someone else's mouth.’
‘Thanks be to God,’ was all that Julia said, but Anne knew how much the news meant to her and to all the family.
The news was all good in the Redmond family too.
Mr Redmond had been looking after the woodyard where he worked while his employer was on a cruise to restore his health, and Sarah told Anne that her father had been given fifty pounds as a mark of appreciation when his employer returned.
Sarah's brother Mick was the star pupil at his College and great things were predicted for him, and John was now fully recovered and walking without a limp.
‘He still can't find a job,’ Sarah said to Anne.
‘But at least he's home and safe.’
‘'God's in His Heaven, All's right with the world’,’ Anne said gaily, and Mabel was shocked.
‘That's blasphemy, Anne!’
‘No, it isn't, Mabel, it's poetry,’ she said.
‘I never heard it,’ Mabel said doubtfully.
‘But you get all your quotations from the Bible, don't you, Mabel?
Sarah said mischievously.
Mabel often quoted lines of poetry to make her point, and whether they came from Tennyson, Keats, Wordsworth or Rupert Brooke, she always prefaced them with ‘As it says in the Bible.’
At first the girls had tried to correct her, but Mabel ignored their efforts and they accepted it as one of her little quirks.
‘Shelley was elevated to the Bible this morning,’ one of them would whisper to the other, but they were fond of Mabel and would never hurt her.
Anne had been to tea again at the Redmond house and this time John was at home.
He greeted her pleasantly, seemingly unaware of the length of time since they had last met, and her pride made her take her cue from him.
Mrs Redmond talked about Bridie's babies, whom she had seen the previous day, and asked Anne about her grandmother.
As usual after Anne and Sarah went into the parlour to play records, and soon they were joined by Mick and John, but the conversation was still general.
Anne stole a glance at John occasionally, and several times caught him looking intently at her, but each time he looked away quickly.
Sarah's young sister Kate came in and offered to do her step dancing to one of the records.
She was a pretty girl with fair curly hair and brown eyes, very self-possessed and a good dancer.
Anne thought she was vain and cheeky, quite unlike shy Sarah.
After she had been applauded and gone out again, Mick announced that he would now demonstrate his Fred Astaire number.
He swooped about, holding an imaginary partner, and John said to Anne, ‘You must think my family are cracked.’
‘You haven't met my brothers,’ she laughed.
They're mad, aren't they, Sarah?
Especially Terry.
And even our Eileen learned to drive on a two-ton milk lorry.’
‘Your sister can drive?’
Mick said, dropping down beside Anne, ‘I'm trying to persuade Dad to buy a car.
Your brother's bought one, hasn't he?’
‘Yes.
Our Tony.
He's engaged and they're saving up to get married, but Helen and him thought it'd be better to buy one now because they'll have a lot of expenses after they're married and won't have Helen's wages.’
Mick asked many questions about Tony's car, none of which Anne could answer.
‘I only know it has four wheels and it goes,’ she said, laughing.
‘That's all you need to know,’ said John.
‘Mick gets all his information off the back of cigarette cards.’
Sarah had changed the record and was winding the gramophone, and Mick asked Anne to dance.
She was surprised by how well he danced, but suspected that Mick did most things well.
‘I don't dance, I'm afraid,’ John said when the record finished and Anne sat down.
‘I've just never thought about it.’
‘Too busy putting the world to rights,’ said his brother.
Sarah had pulled out another record.
‘Harry Roy,’ she exclaimed.
‘Come on, Anne.
This is a quickstep.’
The two girls danced together, then sat talking about the caelidhes and the characters they met there.
They were all surprised when Mrs Redmond appeared with a supper tray.
‘Gosh, hasn't the time gone quickly?’
Sarah said, and Mick added, ‘And not a word about world affairs for once.’
‘That's good,’ Mrs Redmond said.
‘This is the time you should be enjoying yourselves, not bothering your heads about such things.’
She looked at John as she spoke and he looked back at her and smiled.
I wish he'd smile at me like that, Anne thought.
As the weather improved and the days lengthened Anne saw John several times, but usually she was on her bicycle and he was on foot.
They exchanged brief greetings but one day he was walking slowly past the end of Magdalen Street as she cycled up.
Suddenly bold, she stopped by the kerb and spoke to him, and they were still there half an hour later when Eileen walked through from the tram.
Anne introduced John and when Eileen moved away, Anne said goodbye to him and walked up the road with her sister, wheeling her bicycle.
‘He's a nice-looking fellow, isn't he?’ said Eileen.
‘Was he the one who was fighting in Spain?’
‘Yes, he was wounded in the foot but it's healed now.’
‘I'd love to do something like that,’ said Eileen.
‘Fellows have all the fun.’
‘You don't do so badly,’ Anne laughed, and Eileen had to agree.
After that meeting with John, Anne often met him strolling along near her home and always stopped to talk to him.
The conversation usually turned to matters that were never mentioned in Anne's home.
Her father was only interested in his family and his business and although he took the Evening Express , only read local news.
Tony's interests had been wider at one time, but now his mind was full of plans for his marriage with Helen, and his new car.
Like most young men of their age, Stephen and Terry were absorbed in sport, particularly football and Everton Football Club.
John was unlike anyone Anne knew with his views on everything that happened in the world.
On Palestine and Ireland and Hitler's plans for Germany.
He seemed to assume that she was as interested in these questions as he was, and she began to read newspapers thoroughly and listen to news broadcasts on the wireless.
Although Anne had always read voraciously it had been novels and poetry, or volumes of letters and diaries which were her particular favourites.
An Irish relative had told her that Ireland was now to be known as Eire but she knew nothing of the reasons for this, or of what was happening in Germany.
She and Sarah had been indignant and sad to see a picture of Emperor Haile Selassie of Abyssinia on the Pathe News Gazette at the cinema after Mussolini had invaded his country.
A tiny dignified man wearing a cloak and headdress, they had thought him both tragic and romantic but had known nothing  about the background of the struggle.
Now John recalled that struggle and told her that the Italians had invaded Abyssinia and taken Addis Ababa with modern weapons, including poison gas, in spite of a declaration by the League of Nations.
‘I'd call the League a toothless tiger, wouldn't you?’ he said.
Anne had to admit that she had never called the League a tiger, toothless or otherwise, and had known nothing of it until recently.
‘I never knew there was so much going on in the world,’ she said to John one day.
‘Very few people do, Anne, and there's not much information available to ordinary people.
That's why the statesmen can get away with so much,’ he said.
Anne did not allow her new interest in world affairs to interfere with her enjoyment of life, however, and although John never asked her out many other young men did.
She and Sarah tried to arrange their dates for the same evenings, so that for the rest of the week they were free to go out together.
Anne never seemed to have a free moment.
‘Slow down, child, slow down,’ her mother begged as Anne raced around.
‘Sure you'll wear yourself out.’
Tony was teaching Maureen to drive and Anne asked if he would teach her too.
‘Where would you find the time?’ he asked and she had to admit it was impossible.
‘You'll learn quickly when you do have the time,’ Helen said.
‘You won't be like me.’
Helen had been trying to learn for some time, but she found it very hard although Tony was endlessly patient with her.
‘It's that kangaroo juice he puts in the engine,’ Terry teased her after she had started from outside the house in a series of jumps.
‘Ignore him, love.
All you need is confidence, and that will come,’ Tony said protectively.
Maureen showed an unexpected aptitude for driving and learned very quickly but Helen was not  jealous.
All the family were very fond of tiny Helen, who was a gentle loving girl.
Tony thought she was very like his mother in appearance and character.
Julia had been free of pain for many months, but still she had grown weaker.
Mrs Bennet came to clean four times a week now, and another woman came for the washing, and Julia often wondered how she would have managed without them.
In the spring of 1938 the old doctor who had attended her died suddenly and a young man took over the practice.
Maureen asked him to call to see her mother, and the doctor examined her carefully.
‘You say you have been free of pain for nearly two years?’ he said, when he had finished.
‘That's so, doctor, but you know I have the strange feeling that it's still there, biding its time.
I can't seem to get back my strength,’ she said.
The doctor looked carefully at her fingernails and neck, then said abruptly, ‘I want to admit you to the Royal.
They can take an X-ray photograph of you.
It would help me to know what is wrong and how to treat you.’
Julia said nothing for a moment then she said quietly, ‘Thank you, doctor, for the offer, but I don't think I'll go in hospital if you don't mind.’
‘It would only be for investigation,’ he said.
‘I know, doctor, but you see I'm all this time without pain and I think I'll let sleeping dogs lie.
I'm grand apart from the weakness.’
The doctor shrugged.
